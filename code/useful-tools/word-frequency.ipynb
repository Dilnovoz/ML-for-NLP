It is strong because it is grounded in our shared principles of freedom and democracy. It is also strong because we respect and appreciate Israel's commitment to preserve and protect those religious sites considered by all people of the world to be holy. \n",
      "   I am very disturbed over recent events in the Middle East. America's response to Israel must be clear and reflect our total support. What we are witnessing is not, as it is often called, an ``outbreak of violence.'' What we are witnessing is a concerted attack against Israel; and this is occurring on the heels of the Israeli government taking the most conciliatory stance ever toward the Palestinians. \n",
      "   After the Camp David summit, President Clinton correctly blamed Palestinian Authority Chairman Yassir Arafat for rejecting the compromises that Israel was willing to consider. Since Camp David, Arafat has compounded his rejection of peace proposals with an embrace of violence. The United States must maintain its pressure on Arafat and the Palestinian leadership, and avoid retreating into the moral swamp of ``evenhandedness.'' We must stand with Israel. \n",

      "   Appeasement is not just wrong; it also does not work. Events of recent days have led many Israelis to conclude that their government's generosity toward the Palestinians has--far from being reciprocated--been taken as weakness and invited the beating of war drums against Israel throughout the Arab world. \n",

Israel can be counted on to search its soul as to whether she could have defended herself and claimed fewer Palestinian casualties. The result of such an inquiry, however, will not shift the overarching burden of responsibility from the party that chose to abandon the negotiating table and open a shooting war--Palestinian leader Yassir Arafat. \n",

      "   I have four grandchildren--three grandsons and one granddaughter--Ronnie Elam, Brett Elam, Blake Caldwell, and Addison McGillicuddy. The comments I am going to make today really are from the perspective of thinking about them and their future and the desire to see that they will grow up in a country and in a world where their opportunities will be equal to, if not better than, those of their parents, their grandparents, and their great-grandparents. I want them to have a better understanding when they reach that point when they have their own families. \n",
      "   As people look back on the last several decades of the 20th century, I want, at least from my perspective, to be able to put on the record what I believe happened from both an economic and foreign policy perspective, and from a national security perspective. So that is what my comments will reflect today, my thoughts with respect to economics primarily and some that will reflect my feelings with respect to national defense. \n",
      "   So I would like to talk about economics, a topic that has been one of my passions as a Member of the Congress. Economic policy was the very reason I ran for the House of Representatives back in 1982. As many of us may recall, our country remained in a deep recession at the time, still struggling to recover from the economic policies of the 1970s. Although it was still being phased in, President Reagan's economic program was under attack by our friends across the aisle. But, to me, the Reagan economic program was a bold reaffirmation of the very purpose of America. \n",
      "   Many people have noted the happy coincidence that the year 1776 saw the publication of two of the most important documents in world history, Adam Smith's ``Wealth Of Nations'' and Thomas Jefferson's Declaration of Independence. These works share the theme of freedom. Smith made the case for free trade and unfettered markets, as Jefferson put in words the concept that government exists to protect individual liberty. \n",
      "   These documents rebutted, refined, and transcended the prevailing views of 1776 Great Britain. For over a century, these principles held firm and the United States stood tall as a beacon of hope and opportunity for people from all points on the globe. \n",
      "   Ours was a society without a rigid class structure, a society that promised equal opportunity for all based on individual enterprise and hard work, not government privileges and connections. America had no large bureaucracies intruding upon every sphere of commercial life. We relied on the willingness of individuals to shoulder the risk and responsibility that is part and parcel of private enterprise. \n",
      "   But this distinctly American way was challenged by two worldwide crises in the 20th century. First came the Great Depression. Although gross government mismanagement of the money supply and counterproductive trade policies were the cause of this crisis, government was put forward as the cure. This led to the proliferation of alphabet agencies seeking to steer every aspect of the American economy, as government assumed a new income redistribution role. \n",
      "   The second crisis was the rise of totalitarianism on the European Continent. The United States won World War II, but in the process of saving Europe from one brand of tyranny, an equally evil force came to occupy half of Europe, and the war effort was used as the justification for price controls and economic intervention that was unprecedented in the United States. \n",
      "   The welfare state in America grew by leaps and bounds. Once it was conceded that the Government is the guarantor of income, each successive call for new and bigger programs became harder and harder to resist. At the same time, the consolidation of the Soviet bloc presented the largest threat to freedom in human history, presenting new and costly challenges for America as the beacon of freedom. Exaggerations of Soviet economic success fueled the call for greater Government involvement in the U.S. economy. Over time, high tax rates and regulatory excesses accumulated like barnacles to slow the once mighty ship of American private enterprise. \n",
      "   It is hard for younger Americans to imagine how bleak our Nation's prospects appeared before Reagan assumed the Presidency. Recurrent, simultaneous bouts of high unemployment and high inflation confounded most economists, who viewed the two as a tradeoff. It was thought that to reduce unemployment you had to accept inflation and to reduce inflation you had to accept higher unemployment. Producers and consumers suffered from an energy crisis. And real household incomes were shrinking as fast as ``bracket creep'' was raising everyone's tax bill year after year. The response of the incumbent administration was hardly inspiring--ranging from suggesting ``voluntary'' wage and price controls to preaching that we must learn to live within limits. In short, the American establishment was telling the American people to accept the notion that they no longer controlled their own economic destinies. \n",
      "   Starting in the 1970s, the media aggressively advanced the notion popular in intellectual circles that America's free enterprise system was failing. This view persisted through the 1980s. The best-seller lists were crowded with books telling of the decline of America and predicting that Japan would be the economic juggernaut of the 21st century. Even in the 1992 campaign, Bill Clinton and AL GORE were extolling the virtues of the European economic systems, of social democracy and industrial planning. We hear echoes of this approach today, with candidate AL GORE's Government-knows-best mentality. GORE proposes to micromanage and fine-tune the economy, social engineering through tax credits designed to make people behave the way the Washington bureaucrats want them to--such as buying ``fuel-efficient'' eighteen-wheeler trucks. \n",
      "   Ronald Reagan's ``Program for Economic Recovery'' was the opposite of the Government planning approach advocated by the critics of capitalism. Reagan rejected the idea that policymakers could fine-tune the economy,  much less control it from Washington. Instead, he sought to establish a stable environment conducive to economic growth. This meant getting inflation under control, and reducing taxes, regulation, and the size and scope of Government. It meant restoring the incentives for working, saving, investing, and succeeding. It meant opening America to the benefits and challenges of international trade. \n",
      "   Ronald Reagan's economic principles resonated within me. I had seen first-hand the obvious connection between the expansion of Government and our worsening economic performance. When I started in the banking business in 1966, I probably spent 90 to 95 percent of my time engaged in activities that I considered productive--designing new services to attract business, working to increase the market share and profitability of the bank. The rest involved Government paperwork. By the time I left in 1982, this ratio had completely flipped: I was spending 85 to 90 percent of my time trying to figure out how to comply with Government regulations and mandates. There was a constant stream of letters from the Government dictating how we should manage our business, from the Comptroller of the Currency, the Treasury, the FDIC, and the Federal Reserve, on topics ranging from flood insurance to so-called truth-in-lending. I remember a letter that went so far as to tell us the specific temperatures to set our heating and cooling thermostats in our businesses. Some people may have forgotten this level of Government intrusion. \n",
      "   In fact, others may believe it never could happen in a country such as America, but it has. It has happened before, and if we are not vigilant, it could happen again. \n",
      "   I received a letter from Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker detailing which types of loans we could and could not make. To make the example, I could lend a family money to add an additional bedroom to their home. If that same family wanted to add a swimming pool to their home, I was prohibited from making that loan. \n",
      "   To some, this may have made sense if you believed that the Government should be managing consumer demand, but that role made no sense to me. \n",
      "   With my experience in the banking business, it wasn't hard to understand why we as a nation were having difficulty competing around the globe, when we had moved so many of our resources away from productive activities and into trying to comply with Government regulations. Over the years I had come to realize that all the abstract Keynesian theories I was taught in college ignored how the choices and incentives of individuals are altered by government interference in the economy. By failing to account for the real world, those theories in practice had come pretty close to ruining the economy. But along came Ronald Reagan, with a common sense approach that went back to basics--free markets, free enterprise, free trade. Here was a man who had recognized that big Government was a detriment to the economy, a man who approached things from the perspective of freedom as opposed to Government. I shared that perspective and recognized the importance of President Reagan's election. On election night, November 4, 1980, I knew that I had to get involved in this great campaign to restore freedom--but I would have never guessed that, two decades later, I would be standing here in the United States Senate. \n",
      "   Ronald Reagan clearly saw that the problem was too much government, and the solution was more individual freedom. When he assumed the Presidency, we suffered from high inflation and high unemployment. To combat the first, he prescribed reigning in the rapid growth of the money supply, asking the Fed to minimize the damage to the economy caused by high and volatile inflation. The second problem required deep cuts in the high tax rates that were deterring work, saving, and investment. But the Fed delivered tight money a lot sooner than the Congress could deliver the tax cuts, which were phased-in over 3 years. The Fed had overreacted to the stimulus of tax cuts that had not yet arrived, exacerbating the economic downtown, throwing the budget seriously out of balance, and putting the third year of the Reagan tax rate reductions in jeopardy. \n",
      "   In the recession of the early 1980s, the economic policies of President Reagan that inspired me to public service came under attack. In the now famous ``Stay the Course'' campaign of 1982, the President's party retained control of the Senate, minimized losses in the House despite the dire economic times, and preserved the Reagan economic program. We also kept on track President Reagan's defense policies, which were under attack from short-sighted critics who were unwilling to pay the price to ensure our freedom. I am proud that my first campaign was in that fateful year, when President Reagan's detractors stood a chance of putting his programs in jeopardy and I was able to make a stand in favor of his programs. \n",
      "   As I mentioned, the Reagan economic program was my inspiration to run for office. As a freshman, I cut my teeth in the House by circulating a letter vowing support for the President's veto of any bill that tampered with the third year of the tax cuts. After I obtained the 146 signatures necessary to sustain a veto, that threat disappeared, and the Kemp-Roth tax cuts were allowed to work. President Reagan's most dramatic policy change was without a doubt this supply-side tax cut. It seems also inconceivable today that just two decades ago, marginal income tax rates were as high as 70 percent in the United States. It was little wonder that our country was in economic decline, when its most economically productive citizens could keep only a 30 percent share of their additional earnings. These high tax rates not only discouraged additional work and investment at the margin, but also confiscated capital that could have been used for job creation by the private sector. \n",
      "   By cutting income tax rates by 30 percent across-the-board, Reagan restored a large measure of freedom to the American taxpayer--not just the freedom to spend money that would have been taxed away, but the freedom that results when economic decisions are no longer influenced by high tax rates. It was not about the dollars that would have been collected had tax rates stayed high, but the choices that would never have been made because of these high rates--decisions to expand plant capacities or start new businesses, for instance. \n",
      "   President Reagan entered the White House with one paramount spending goal: to rebuild our national defense, since national security is the most fundamental responsibility of the Federal Government. He realized that to provide this desperately needed public good, while cutting tax rates to unleash the productive forces of the nation, required fiscal restraint in the non-defense portion of the Federal budget. \n",
      "   The difficulties that President Reagan had in taming the congressional urge to spend made a balanced budget and tax limitation amendment to the Constitution one of my top priorities when I entered Congress. It also motivated me to be the main House sponsor, along with Dick Cheney, of the Gramm-Rudman Deficit Reduction Act, which worked for at least a few years to hold spending down. Today, as much as ever, I believe some super majority restriction on the ability of Members of Congress to spend taxpayers' dollars is necessary. Unless taxes are cut to keep the revenues from flowing into Washington, the trillions of dollars of surpluses that are projected over the next decade will not last--if the taxes are collected, Congress will spend them. \n",
      "   Reagan also initiated a sea change in monetary policy. He did not want the Federal Reserve to manipulate the money supply in an attempt to target interest or unemployment rates. All he wanted was price stability, the elimination of high levels of inflation from the economy. The Fed should not be responsible for the level of growth in the economy--this is the role of the private sector. The best economic environment that the Fed can provide is one in which inflation expectations play a small or almost nonexistent role in long-term planning. Reagan's appointees to the Federal Reserve Board, people like Alan Greenspan, Preston Martin, Manley Johnson, Martha Seger, and Wayne Angell, shared this view and took politics out of monetary policy.  \n",
      "   Throughout the Reagan years, the loudest and strongest advocate of stable prices in the Congress was Jack Kemp. Jack would talk tirelessly about the need for ``a dollar as good as gold,'' and his intellectual and political support for this position no doubt influenced President Reagan's selection of Greenspan as Fed Chairman. Alan Greenspan continues to hold sway at the Federal Reserve as part of the Reagan legacy, and his record at containing inflation has set a high standard. As a member of the Senate Banking Committee I have attempted to institutionalize this approach to monetary policy, sponsoring a bill that would make price stability, not economic growth or ``stabilization,'' the goal of the Federal Reserve. Thanks to the monetary policy initiated by President Reagan, this legislation is now a safeguard rather than a necessity. \n",
      "   The prevailing attitude concerning trade has also shifted, thanks to President Reagan--who recognized the fallacy of protectionism. In large part, this was due to his belief in competition and free enterprise. But his attitude was also shaped by his confidence in America. He was neither afraid of foreign competition, nor embarrassed that imports might be preferred over American goods. America, as a nation of immigrants, represents the best that the world can offer. More than any consumer good, the main export of America must be the ideal of political and economic freedom, an ideal that is undercut by trade restrictions. \n",
      "   By signing a free trade agreement with Canada, opening free trade negotiations with Mexico, and proposing the dismantling of agricultural trade barriers in the Uruguay Round of the GATT, Ronald Reagan went on the offensive for trade liberalization. At a time when Japan-bashing was commonplace--when Members of Congress were literally bashing Japanese-made electronics into pieces on the steps of the Capitol--Reagan did not retreat from his basic free-trade principles. The remarkable success of U.S. industries from computers, semiconductors, software, biotechnology and many others over the past 2 decades has vindicated Reagan's belief that American business prospers best in an open and competitive free enterprise environment. \n",
      "   Today, principally as a result of the supply-side policies pursued by the Reagan administration, the U.S. economy is healthy. Both inflation and unemployment are low. Productivity is growing rapidly and incomes are rising. \n",
      "   Any doubts that President Reagan is responsible for today's bounty should be dispelled by considering a few fundamental questions. Would American economic growth be as robust today if the Federal Government still took 70 cents of every additional dollar of income from our most productive citizens? If the typical family was hit with a 49 percent Federal income tax rate on top of an effective payroll tax rate of 14.2 percent? \n",
      "   Would our economy be so strong if we were still suffering from double-digit inflation and interest rates, due to the politicized use of monetary policy to manipulate consumer demand? If the trend of the last 2 decades were toward managed trade, rather than freer trade? Would entrepreneurs and innovators abound if high inflation and high tax rates on capital gains slashed the returns to their risk-taking? \n",
      "   Would the Soviet Empire have fallen if it had not been for the military buildup, diplomatic leadership, and resolute defense of freedom during the presidency of Ronald Reagan? Would our country be as secure as it is today if instead of trading partners, the people of Eastern and Central Europe were still prisoners of the Soviet bloc? If our fellow Americans south of our border were still the potential victims of imported totalitarianism instead of full participants in established democracies? \n",
      "   Our debt to Ronald Reagan reminds me of an exchange mission I once went on, with Tom Foley and Dick Cheney. \n",
      "   It was a congressional delegation that went to France in 1985. On that trip, we spent most of our time in Paris. But for the last several days, we went out to the French countryside. I went to a little town called Le Mans, where I traveled around with my host, Francois, from that district. I learned a lot about what his country was experiencing. \n",
      "   At the end of that tour, we did what many of us would refer to as an old-fashioned town meeting, where I responded to questions from the French audience for almost 2 hours. At the end of the period, I asked Francois if it would be all right if I were to ask the audience a question. And he was gracious in my request, and I asked them: Since I am returning to America tomorrow, I would like to be able to tell other people of the State of Florida what you think about our country. \n",
      "   The first person stood up and said: ``We think of America as a dynamic, growing, thriving, exciting place.'' A second person that stood up said basically the same thing. The third person to address me was a fellow who probably was in his late 70's or early 80's. This fellow was stooped over, his weight being supported precariously on an old, gnarled cane. He came over closer to me, looked me directly in the eyes, and said: ``You tell the people of America that we will never forget that it was the American G.I. who saved our little town. You tell them we'll never forget!'' \n",
      "   Well, I feel that way about Ronald Reagan, my political hero, who inspired me to enter politics. America will never forget what President Reagan did for us. He gave us back our faith and renewed our belief in this country. He gave America back its pride. He rebuilt America's defenses. His economic policies reduced taxes, reduced inflation, reduced unemployment. He put America back to work again. He reminded America what made us a great nation--our commitment to freedom. And he won the cold war without firing a single shot. \n",

After weeks of reported torture, these accounts suggest that confessions were obtained under duress that identified Shaiboub William Arsel as the murderer. Mr. Arsel was subsequently sentenced to 15 years of hard labor. \n",

      "   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, as a co-sponsor of the Community Renewal and New Markets Act of 2000, I want to commend Chairman ROTH for his usual fine work in assembling a bill that garners the support of such a large number of our Finance Committee colleagues. I am pleased that a number of items in this bill are provisions that are extremely important to me, and I would like to speak briefly concerning them. \n",
      "   But I also want to draw attention to some provisions in this bill that I do not favor. As this bill stands in the place of what would have been a bill reported out of the Committee on Finance, it reflects the compromises that are inherent in the committee process. Unlike typical bills, of which it is reasonable to assume that every provision is supported by every co-sponsor, probably every co-sponsor of this bill can find provisions contained in it that he does not support. Of many, there are two that I find most troubling: the ``new markets tax credit,'' and the ``individual development accounts.'' \n",
      "   These two provisions are appropriations masquerading as tax cuts. Under the new markets tax credit, the Secretary of the Treasury would annually pay dividends to investors in ``community development entities,'' which must be certified by the Treasury Department and which must have as their primary mission investing in low-income people or communities. This proposal is premised on the belief that an entity that lacks a profit-motive, under federal bureaucratic supervision, will be an attractive investment for people if dividends are guaranteed. It is the sort of scheme that could only be dreamed up by people who have spent their entire careers in government. A simpler way to direct capital to investment-starved pockets is by eliminating the tax on capital gains--this is the decentralized, market-oriented approach. \n",
      "   The ``individual development accounts'' would launder government-matching funds for low income savers through financial institutions. This new entitlement cannot be justified. It is true that, by some measures, the savings rate in the United States appears low. Simple logic dictates that the savings rate have been lowered due to federal tax policies, which impose several layers of taxation upon income that is saved. It is one thing to address this problem at the source, by removing the extra taxation on savings--a we do to the extent that people can make deductible contributions to traditional IRAs and contributions to Roth IRAs. But to give people money to reward them for saving is pure income redistribution, a misuse of the taxpayers' money. \n",
      "   Despite my disagreement with some of the provisions of this bill, I am pleased that the bill contains several initiatives that I have proposed over the past few Congresses. The Low Income Housing Tax Credit is boosted to make up for over a decade's worth of inflation, and is indexed to prevent this problem from reoccurring. The First-Time Homebuyer Tax Credit for the District of Columbia is extended and the marriage penalty in the credit is eliminated. Section 1706 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which discriminates against high technology workers and the companies that hire them, is repealed. Not-for-hire disaster insurance funds, in my state of Florida and several others, are made tax-exempt entities. \n",
      "   I am most encouraged by the extension of my zero percent capital gains tax rate proposal to businesses in the entire District of Columbia, and to businesses in all empowerment and renewal zones. Although I am concerned that the lengthy, five-year holding period is unwise and undermines the power of the proposal, I am nevertheless pleased that the idea is spreading and people are coming to see capitalism as the only true cure for poverty. \n",

      "   Mr. MACK. Madam President, I rise today to engage my colleague from Florida in a colloquy. Specifically, I want to clarify our understanding of the portion of the legislation we're considering today to restore, preserve and protect the Everglades ecosystem. My understanding is that the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan authorized by this bill create a balance between state and federal interests in ensuring that the predicted Plan benefits--including benefits to both state and federal lands--are attained. It is my view that this bill is intended to recognize and maintain the State's interest in preserving the sovereignty, in State law, over the reservation and allocation of water within the State's boundaries. It is my further understanding that the Agreement called for between the President and the Governor of Florida will not result in a federalization of State water law. Florida water law requires that all reasonable beneficial water uses and natural system demands are subject to a public interest balancing test. Implementation of the Plan will rely upon State law and processes for reserving and allocating water for all users, according to the principles set out in the legislation before us. It is not the intent of this Act, or the President/Governor Agreement required by this Act, to create a procedure where all of the new water made available by the Plan will be allocated to the natural system leaving nothing for other water users. Rather, the agreement will simply ensure that water for the natural system is reserved first, and any remaining water may be allocated among other users according to the provisions of State water law. I yield to my colleague from Florida, Senator GRAHAM. \n",

I want to take a moment of the Senate's time today to express my understanding of this resolution and my own intent in agreeing to its inclusion in the bill before us today. \n",
      "   As my colleagues are aware, this Air Force base is currently in the disposal process set forth by Congress when it established a fair and impartial system for closing military facilities around the country. Since Hurricane Andrew devastated the region in 1992, the citizens of South Florida have waited for a disposal decision from the federal government. It is anticipated the property could provide a stable economic platform for a community that is in need of jobs and economic development. Clearly, it is my intent that whatever use to which the property is ultimately put be accomplished in a manner that does not adversely impact the surrounding environment or the Everglades restoration plan we're considering today. \n",
      "   But let me be clear, Mr. President. It is emphatically not my intent that this resolution be read by the United States Air Force to mean they should add to, alter, or amend the existing process for disposing the property at Homestead Air Force Base. It is my strong view that the process for conveying surplus military property is clearly set forth in the law and that process should be followed until the final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement on the property is completed and the Air Force disposes the property. \n",

The State of Florida is a full partner with us in this restoration effort, and I believe the work we've put in together in writing this bill bodes well for a lasting partnership on behalf of the Everglades. \n",

It was a great performance. It reminded me a little of Chicken Little in ``The Sky is Falling'' when I listened to equating $86 million in operating expenses to a $1.4 billion budget. The $86 million will be the cost of operating and maintaining this new system 25 or 30 years from now. I think it might be appropriate to try to figure out what the Corps' budget might be 25 or 30 years from now. I think that would bring a more significant understanding of the impact of the operating and maintenance costs to the Federal Government. \n",
      "   The second point I will make is that we are already spending more than that now on the Everglades. I suggest that on this project we are proposing today--and I believe strongly that it will pass--we will probably seek a reduction in the long run as a part of the Corps' budget. But, again, I appreciate the fervor with which my colleague presented his argument. \n",

      "   Mr. President, I am in strong opposition to the amendment offered by my friend from Virginia. This amendment, if passed, will put an end to the unprecedented partnership developed between the Federal Government and the State of Florida in an effort to restore and protect America's Everglades. While I am sure my colleague from Virginia has the best of intentions in offering his amendment, I caution my colleagues that one-size-fits-all solutions can be extremely harmful to \n",
      "   something as sensitive and as difficult as Everglades restoration. \n",
      "   It may be useful to take a few minutes today to help highlight the Everglades provision in the water resources bill before us and explain how the amendment of the Senator from Virginia will impact our longstanding efforts to restore and protect this unique ecosystem. \n",
      "   Let me begin by stating that the legislation before us today is a consensus product supported by a full spectrum of environmental groups and economic stakeholders. It is supported by Florida's two Indian tribes, Gov. Jeb Bush of the State of Florida, and it is supported by the Clinton administration. \n",
      "   Nine months ago, my colleague from Florida, Senator GRAHAM, and I set out to write a balanced Everglades bill that addressed the needs of south Florida's environment and its citizens. This was no small task. We asked individuals and groups who have long been divided to set aside their differences and work together with us. We asked them to help us restore this vibrant, natural system to its former glory. With the steady leadership of Chairman BOB SMITH and Senator BAUCUS, we have accomplished our goal. The bill we bring to the floor today is something of which all Americans, and I believe all Senators, can be proud. \n",
      "   In the bill we are considering today, we authorize a comprehensive plan to undo the harm done by 50 years of Federal efforts to control flooding in south Florida, without consideration for damage done to south Florida's environment. This comprehensive plan was developed over the past 8 years by the Corps of Engineers, with input from economic and environmental stakeholders, local governments, scientists, restoration engineers, the people of south Florida, and the Congress. It is recognized throughout south Florida and the Nation as a fair and balanced plan to provide for the water-related needs of the region while, for the first time, ensuring that the needs of the Everglades will be met as well. \n",
      "   It is terribly important that we do this. Without this plan, the Everglades will die and water, the lifeblood of south Florida's economy, will continue to be siphoned off into the sea without benefiting the environment or the people who live and work in the region. \n",
      "   Let me take a moment to share with you some of the principles Senator GRAHAM and I have used to guide our efforts this year in drafting this bill. We wanted to be sensitive to the legitimate concerns and needs of all citizens and interests who have a stake in how the plan is implemented, we wanted to be true to the restoration mandate and ensure that the Everglades got the first benefit of any new water generated by the plan, and we wanted to affirm and establish in law the true partnership we share with the State of Florida in achieving the plan's restoration goal. \n",
      "   The cooperation between the State agencies charged with managing this effort and the Federal Government over the years has been truly unprecedented. The State shared the cost of developing the plan we are considering today. The Corps of Engineers has benefited greatly from the engineering talent at the South Florida Water Management District. Florida has been our full partner in bearing half of the cost of the restoration projects already underway in the Everglades. The State has committed to split evenly the cost of implementing the plan once it is authorized. The reason for this partnership is simple. \n",
      "   Both the State and Federal Government have a vital interest in the restoration of the Everglades. Both the State and the Federal Government should pay for the cost of operating and maintaining the restoration project once it is built. \n",
      "   I say this to provide background for the debate on the amendment before us. This partnership we have established is vital to our efforts, and if this amendment passes, it will be very difficult to accomplish our restoration goals. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "106-mack-fl-3-20000921\n",
      "\n",
      "   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, a key part of this partnership has been the commitment by the State of Florida--already enshrined in a bill approved by Governor Bush earlier this year--to pay fully half the $7.8 billion cost of implementing the Everglades restoration plan. This is a significantly greater cost share than the local sponsor typically pays to construct a Corps project. \n",
      "   Many Corps projects have a local cost share of as little as 20 percent of the total project and few pay more than 35 percent. In fact, if the State were paying 35 percent, rather than the 50 percent it has committed to, it would increase the burden of the Federal taxpayer by almost $1.2 billion. Let me repeat that. The State has committed to a greater-than-average cost share for constructing the restoration project and will save the Federal taxpayers almost $1.2 billion. \n",
      "   I believe the good faith demonstrated by the State's offer--not to mention the resulting savings of the Federal Government--clearly refutes any argument that the State is somehow unduly benefiting from the operation and maintenance cost share proposed in the bill before us today. \n",
      "   While I cannot stress enough the damage this amendment will do to our relationship with the State of Florida, I remind my colleagues about the significant Federal investment we are making in the Everglades and the important Federal interest in ensuring this project is operated and maintained properly. \n",
      "   Within the boundaries of the proposed restoration area, there are four national parks, including Everglades National Park, one of the crown jewels of our National Park System. There is a national marine sanctuary and many other national interests. All of these important environmental assets are dependent upon the successful operation of the restoration plan. \n",
      "   If the project is not operated properly--if the water is not right--these important Federal holdings in south Florida will continue to suffer the same fate they are suffering today. If we and the State of Florida are to come together behind a restoration plan and spend $7.8 billion to implement that plan, it seems we also have the responsibility and obligation to stay in Florida and help with the successful operation and maintenance of the project. That is a reasonable position. \n",
      "   I add that the operation and maintenance cost share in this bill is fully consistent with prior central and southern Florida project authorizations. In fact, the Federal Government pays the full cost of operating and maintaining the levees, channels, locks, and control works of the St. Lucie Canal, Lake Okeechobee, and the Caloosahatchee River. The Federal Government pays the full cost--not 50-50, but the full cost--of operating the levees, channels, locks, and control works of the St. Lucie Canal, Lake Okeechobee, and the Caloosahatchee River. All of these areas that I have mentioned are in this restoration area. It pays the full cost of operating and maintaining the main spillways in the system's water conservation area. \n",
      "   Further, the Flood Control Act of 1968 provided that the project costs of providing water delivery to Everglades National Park is considered a federal responsibility and on that basis the federal government would share in the operation and maintenance of projects that serve that area of the system. The federal government is also required, under a 1989 law, to participate in the cost share for the modified water deliveries project. And, finally, the water resources bill of 1996 provides that the cost of operating and maintaining water deliveries to Taylor Slough and Everglades National Park be shared between the State and federal governments. \n",
      "   That is my argument to this constant mention of the fact that for 14 years we have had this precedent.  \n",
      "   I have just stated the whole series of issues related to the Everglades in which there is a whole range of the sharing of costs and maintaining the Everglades system. \n",
      "   There appears to be ample precedent for a shared cost between the State and federal governments on projects related to the Everglades and Everglades restoration. \n",
      "   What the Senator from Virginia is advocating is something far different. He would have the federal government pack up and leave when the restoration project is completed--essentially abandoning precedent and abandoning a national treasure after an unprecedented effort to save it. His amendment would have the federal government abdicate its responsibility, to both the environment and the taxpayer, to protect the substantial investment we're making on their behalf in the Everglades. \n",
      "   I would remind my colleagues, the Everglades is a dynamic system. It is dependent on the steady, reliable supply of fresh water this restoration project will provide over the years. \n",
      "   It is not like a levee, or a bridge, which the federal government can construct and turn over to the local authorities. This is an enormously complex restoration project managing the water flow over and through 18,000 square miles of subtropical uplands, wetlands and coral reefs. The area covered by this project spans from Lake Okeechobee to Key West; from Fort Myers on the gulf to Fort Pierce on the Atlantic. \n",
      "   This is not an investment we can afford to abandon, Mr. President. The investment is too great and the stakes are too high. I would urge my colleagues to defeat the amendment. \n",

      "   Mr. MACK. This will be a brief response. I apologize to my colleagues for trying to hop in here, but the Senator raised a question I thought should be responded to: What makes us different? \n",
      "   In the State of Florida, in 1994, we passed the Everglades Forever Act which provides for local payment of water cleanup costs. The Federal Government's share in the cost of cleaning up the water that directly benefits Federal areas such as the Everglades National Park--the fact is that the local communities are paying for the cleanup of the waters that the Senator has suggested. \n",
      "   The second point I make, I think there is something unique about what we have come up with. The Senator says the uniqueness is the 50-50 cost sharing. The uniqueness that I see--and I don't think there is a Member who has traveled to the State of Florida and become involved and knowledgeable about the Everglades Project, who is not amazed by the partnerships that have been developed--is the various interests in our State that have come together and who have said not only do they support but they are willing to put money into it. \n",
      "   As the Senator knows, the State of Florida, during this past legislative session, in fact, put up I believe almost $200 million towards this project. \n",
      "   Again, to answer the question directly, the cities are, in fact, paying. The State of Florida anticipated that question in 1994 and passed the act that I referred to a few moments ago. \n",

There is, as I read in my statement, a whole series of things in which there is even 100-percent participation at the Federal level for operation and maintenance. \n",

      "   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I respond to the question raised by the Senator from Virginia when we were talking about cost share. I suggested to Senator WARNER, if he looked in other places in Public Law 104, which is referred to as the Water Resources Development Act of 1996, he would find other language different from the language to which he was referring. That is found in section 316, central and southern Florida Canal, 111. Under ``Operation and Maintenance,'' it says:  \n",
      "   The non-Federal share of operation and maintenance cost of the improvements undertaken pursuant to this section shall be 100 percent;  \n",
      "   However, if you go on, it says:  \n",
      "   ......except that the Federal Government shall reimburse the non-Federal interest with respect to the project 60 percent of the cost of operating and maintaining pump stations that pump water into Taylor Slough and in the Everglades National Park.  \n",
      "   I wonder what the argument was 14 years ago about changing precedent. People want to refer to precedent. The reality is that Congress does what the Congress believes is necessary to carry out an important project. I think it is pretty clear. In fact, my colleagues who oppose this cost share have indicated they are going to support the resolution, or support the act; therefore, I think, accepting the notion of the significance and importance of what we are doing. And therefore it is reasonable for the Senate to determine on this particular project because of its unusual, unique circumstances, that somehow we should, in fact, have a 50-50 cost share. \n",
      "   I do not find that stunning, and I am not impressed with the fact that for the last 14 years which some want to refer to that there has been a precedent established. There are all kinds of indications that we have had different cost shares, to the extent that we find in some areas the Federal Government is picking up 100 percent of the cost of operation and maintenance. \n",

      "   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the future of U.S. trade relations with China and the impending vote on China's PNTR status. The prosperity that this nation has enjoyed for the past 50 years has been a result of our commitment to free trade and opening markets. Free trade benefits all--it enhances prosperity and develops markets, essential elements to the spread of freedom, democracy, and the rule of law. China's entry into the World Trade Organization will also enhance American competitiveness, further our national interests, and benefit our trading partners. But we must enter into this agreement with our eyes open. China must comply with this agreement for it to have meaning. The United States must vigilantly seek enforcement of all agreements with China, including those addressing national security and human rights. \n",
      "   I share the concern of my colleague, Senator THOMPSON, regarding China's proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. On August 9th of this year, the Director of Central Intelligence reported that China remained a ``key supplier'' of weapons technology and increased-missile related assistance to Pakistan as recently as the second half of 1999. In the last year it has been reported that China transferred missile technology to Libya and North Korea and may still be providing secret technical assistance to Pakistan's nuclear program. U.S. Intelligence has also provided evidence that the PRC has provided Iran with nuclear technology, chemical weapons materials, and missile technology that would violate China's commitment to observe the MTCR and U.S. laws. I do not suggest that because of these violations we should cut off trade with China, but we must address the fact that they are supplying rogue nations with weapons of mass destruction. This threat to our national security has made my decision on this vote a difficult one, and that has been compounded by my concerns with China's repeated human rights abuses. \n",
      "   I suspect that each of my colleagues has had some opportunity over the years to hear about the human rights abuses taking place in China. I think one of the more eloquent spokesmen for the struggle for freedom has been Wei Jingsheng. He reminds us that those of us who live in the luxury of freedom should not forget those who are still struggling for liberty and freedom. \n",
      "   Mr. President, because of these very strong conflicting views, the importance of open and free trade on the one hand, and the importance of human dignity and the pursuit of freedom on the other, this has been a difficult decision for me. But, after due consideration, I conclude that moving toward open and free markets advances freedom in China, so long as China is willing to abide by the rules of the WTO. \n",
      "   By exposing China to global competition and the benefits it has to offer, Chinese leaders will be both obligated and empowered to more quickly move their country toward full economic reform. And by virtue of their business relationships, over time the Chinese people will be exposed to information, ideas and debate from around the world. This in turn will encourage them and their leadership to embrace the virtue and promise of individual freedom. The reason I am willing to embrace it has much has to do with the kinds of changes we have seen taking place in China over the years. If they were still committed to the ideology of the 1950's and 1960's, I do not think we would be here today. But, they have clearly moved toward opening their economy, and we should continue to push to open the country to freedom. \n",
      "   So I think it is time for us to respond to these changes by saying to the Chinese people--we want to be engaged in free trade and competition with you. I think, in the end, humanity will benefit. So I will cast a vote in favor of this legislation. \n",

      "   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues to join us to reduce the marriage penalties in the tax code. This bill will provide married couples the relief that President Clinton denied them last year with his veto of the Taxpayer Refund and Relief Act of 1999. President Clinton's action last year increased taxes by close to $800 billion and imposed a marriage penalty on middle class American families. \n",
      "   There is no place in the Tax Code for marriage penalties. Marriage penalties are caused by tax laws that treat joint filers relatively worse than single filers with half the income. It has of late become common practice to use the Tax Code for purposes of social engineering, discouraging some actions with the stick of tax penalties and encouraging others with the carrot of tax preferences. But there is no legitimate policy reason for punishing taxpayers with higher taxes just because they happen to be married. The marriage penalties in the Tax Code undermine the family, the institution that is the foundation of our society. \n",
      "   I view this bill as just a start. Our Tax Code will not truly be family-friendly until every single marriage penalty is rooted out and eliminated, so that married couples with twice the income of single individuals are taxed at the same rates, and are eligible for the same tax preferences--including deductions, exemptions, use of IRAs and other savings vehicles--as those single filers. This bill is an important step toward that ultimate goal. \n",
      "   The Democrat criticisms of our bill are misplaced. They argue that our bill contains complicated phase-ins, in contrast to their simple approach. But anyone who reads the bill and their alternative would see that this is false. The Finance Committee bill contains percentages in it, sure enough. And it phases in the relief, that is true. But the percentages and the phase-ins are instructions to the Treasury and the IRS, to make adjustments to the tax brackets. The only people who have to make any new calculations under the Finance Committee bill are the bureaucrats who make up the tax tables, not the taxpayer.  \n",
      "   By contrast, the Democrat alternative, in phasing in its relief, requires taxpayers to calculate their taxes as joint filers, then calculate their taxes as if they were single--a complicated process that requires the allocation of various deductions and credits. Next, the taxpayer would have to determine the difference between these two calculations and then reduce this by a certain percentage. That is supposed to be simple? The Democrat substitute adds to the headaches of tax filing and the demand for tax preparers and tax preparation software. \n",
      "   The Democrats also complain that the Finance Committee bill does more than address their narrow definition of the marriage penalty. They invoke the so-called ``marriage bonus.'' But the ``marriage bonus'' is a red herring. What they call a ``marriage bonus'' results from adjusting tax brackets for joint filers to reflect the fact that two adults are sharing the household income. Under the Democrat approach, single taxpayers who marry a non-working or low-earning spouse should pay the same amount of taxes as when they were single, even though this income must be spread over the needs of two adults. \n",
      "   This approach is fundamentally flawed. The Democrat approach would enshrine in the law a new ``homemaker penalty.'' The Democrats would make families with one earner and one stay-at-home spouse pay higher taxes than families with the same household income and two earners. \n",
      "   But why discriminate against one-earner families? Why would we want a tax code that penalized families just because one of the spouses chooses the hard work of the household over the role of breadwinner? The Democrat alternative discourages parents from staying home with their infant children, and penalizes a person who works longer hours so that a spouse can care for elderly parents. That is just plain wrong. \n",
      "   The Finance Committee bill reduces the marriage penalty in a rational, sensible way, by making the standard deduction for joint filers twice what it is for single filers, and by making the ranges at which income is taxed at the 15 percent and 28 percent rates twice for joint filers what they are for single filers. This recognizes that marriage is a partnership in which two adults share the household income. Our approach cuts taxes for all American families. The Democrats call this a ``bonus.'' We call it common sense. \n",

      "   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues to vote to bury the death tax once and for all. This tax is anti-family and anti-capitalist, smothers the American Dream, and is rationalized only by the greed of government and envy of success. \n",
      "   The debate over death tax repeal highlights, as much as any issue that we will consider, a fundamental difference in philosophy among members of this body, and between the Republican Congress and the current Administration. We in the majority believe that the federal government has no right to claims the lion's share of any person's wealth just because that person had the misfortune of dying. The proponents of the death tax think otherwise. \n",
      "   At the root of this philosophical difference are two vastly different views of the nature of wealth creation and its role in society. The supporters of the death tax seem to harbor a pessimistic, zero-sum view of wealth--the belief that every dollar saved by one person is one less dollar for the rest of us. This belief makes it easier to argue that a ceiling be placed on the level of wealth attained by any individual or family in America--people justify the confiscation of wealth above this level by attacking as greedy any family that seeks to accumulate more at the expenses of the rest of society. \n",
      "   But this view is flawed. There is no finite limit to the amount of wealth that can be created in a society. People become wealthy in a market economy by satisfying the wants of others. Wealth is not a windfall to people with natural intelligence or ability, or who happen to stumble across valuable resources; it is created by providing consumers the goods, materials, and services that they desire at a price that does not exceed their estimate of its value. \n",
      "   When one understands this concept, the death tax cannot be justified. If Bill Gates had chosen a career as a government bureaucrat instead of being a software entrepreneur, the tens of billions of dollars he has amassed in wealth would not have been distributed to others in society--instead, this fortune would never have been generated. It came about because Mr. Gates has provided goods and services to the public that they valued as much or more than the price he charged. Every voluntary exchange between that free individuals in a market economy creates wealth, and the businesses that provide the most consumer satisfaction will create the most wealth. When those goods and services are not offered, this wealth is not created, and everyone in society is poorer because their preferred choice does not exist. \n",
      "   Proponents of the death tax argue that the heirs and legatees of an individual's fortune did nothing to deserve this bounty. Since it is a windfall to these individuals, why shouldn't the government get a piece of the action? Some death tax supporters go one step further, and have argued on this very floor that, unlikely the heirs, the government has a claim to this wealth because it is responsible for the prosperous American economic environment. This argument amounts to the claim that, since government refrains from confiscating property while people are alive, the government is entitled to confiscate upon death. \n",
      "   It makes no sense to terminate property rights at death as the price to pay for their protection while living. The inheritors of property have a right to the property not because of anything they have done, but because it is the will of the decedent. If people cannot leave to their family and friends the wealth they create, they lose the incentive to create it. The higher the rate of death tax falling on their estate, the smaller, the motive to invest in and build a business. The inheritors of property have earned the right to receive it, because they served as the motivation behind the creation of wealth beyond what decedents would consume in their respective lifetimes. \n",
      "   It has been estimated that the death tax will cost the economy almost one trillion dollars over the next decade and almost 275,000 jobs in large part because it robs people of the incentive to invest. I regularly receive letters from older constituents explaining that they have no desire to reinvest profits in their business only to have the government claim 55 percent of the business's increase in value. I am sure all of my colleagues receive similar \n",
      "   letters. \n",
      "   The death tax robs people of the incentive to build up their businesses, smothering the American Dream. The death tax eliminates the jobs that these discouraged entrepreneurs would have created. The death tax reduces the savings pool, reducing capital investments and reducing future productivity. The death tax reduces the choices of goods and services available to consumers. And, perhaps worst of all, the death tax places the interest of government over that of families. \n",
      "   Why do we have to impose a tax upon death? Every person spends a lifetime paying taxes on the earnings from which their life savings comes. The income from inherited assets, such as stock dividends or business profits, will be taxed as it is earned. And, under our death tax repeal bill, any capital gain above the exemption amount will result in capital gains taxes when the asset is actually sold. Why the hurry to impose a tax at the time of death, a tax which forces families to sell land, personal property, and business interests that had been in the family for generations? \n",
      "   The only reasons are the greed of the government and the death tax supporters' disapproval of inherited wealth. Under current law, the federal government will be collecting over $4 trillion more in taxes than it is budgeted to spend in the next decade alone. It is the federal government that needs a limit to its ability to enjoy the fruits of the hard work of our taxpayers, not the families of these taxpayers. \n",
      "   The supporters of the death tax seem genuinely puzzled that the American people, in poll after poll, overwhelmingly support repeal of the death tax. They cannot understand why do many people would oppose a tax that directly affects so few. But the American people understand economics much better than the death taxers. They recognize the loss of jobs and opportunity. They also harbor in their hearts the dream that one day they, too, might be so successful as to amass the wealth that is subject to the confiscatory rates of the death tax. But, most of all, they recognize that a tax may be unfair even though it targets a small segment of the population--indeed, a tax may be unfair because it does so. This part of the American spirit does not seem to be appreciated by the death taxers. \n",
      "   Mr. President, the specter of the federal death tax should no longer hover over our citizens, waiting to swoop down and confiscate the savings that has taken a lifetime to build. I urge all of my colleagues to vote for the Death Tax Elimination Act. \n",

      "   Mr. MACK. Mr, President, as many of my colleagues are aware, cancer has played a prominent role in my family's history. Some in our family--me, my wife Priscilla, our daughter Debbie--have been lucky enough to have fought cancer and won. Others in our family have not been so lucky. My father died of esophageal cancer, my mother died of kidney cancer and my younger brother Michael died of melanoma at the very young age of thirty-five. \n",
      "   As a result, Priscilla and I have become very active in the fight against cancer and in spreading the message that early detection saves lives. It's a part of who we are as a family. \n",
      "   And there are other families with their own stories. Michael J. Fox and his family are waging war against Parkinson's disease. Mary Tyler Moore and her family are fighting diabetes. Christopher Reeve and his family are searching for a cure to paralysis. And millions of other families across the United States are fighting their own battles against AIDS, sickle-cell anemia, Lou Gehrig's disease, Alzheimer's and the many, many other diseases that take our loved ones away from us. \n",
      "   What I've come to realize in my fight against cancer is the crucial role the federal government plays in funding basic medical research at the National Institutes of Health, and how important basic research is to finding breakthroughs not just for cancer but for all of the diseases which affect our families. \n",
      "   For several years now, doubling funding at NIH has been a primary goal of mine in the Senate. The Federal Government, mainly through the NIH, funds about 36 percent of all biomedical research in this country, and plays an especially large role in basic research. \n",
      "   Recently, the Joint Economic Committee, released a first-of-its kind study: ``The Benefits of Medical Research and the Role of the NIH,'' which examines how funding for the NIH cuts the high economic costs of disease, reduces suffering from illness, and helps Americans live longer, healthier lives. And I'd like to take a moment, Mr. President, to share with my colleagues some of the findings in this extensive report. \n",
      "   According to the JEC, the economic costs of illness in the U.S. are huge--approximately $3 trillion annually, or 31 percent of the nation's GDP. This includes the costs of public and private health care spending, and productivity losses from illness. Medical research can reduce \n",
      "   these high costs. But, the NIH is fighting this $3 trillion battle with a budget of $16 billion. That's just half of a percent of the total economic cost of disease in the United States. \n",
      "   In addition to lowering the economic costs of illness, advances in medical research greatly help people live longer and healthier lives. A recent study found that longevity increases have created ``value of life'' gains to Americans of about $2.4 trillion every year. A  significant portion of these longevity gains stem from NIH-funded research in areas such as heart disease, stroke and cancer. If just 10 percent of the value of longevity increases, $240 billion, resulted from NIH research, that would mean a return of $15 for every $1 invested in NIH. \n",
      "   Also according to the JEC, NIH-funded research helped lead to the development of one-third of the top 21 drugs introduced over the last few decades. These drugs treat patients with ovarian cancer, AIDS, hypertension, depression, herpes, various cancers, and anemia. Future drug research holds great promise for curing many diseases and lowering the costs of illness by reducing hospital stays and invasive surgeries. In fact, one study found that a $1 increase in drug expenditures reduces hospital costs by about $3.65. \n",
      "   We know that past medical advances have dramatically reduced health care costs for such illnesses as tuberculosis, polio, peptic ulcers, and schizophrenia. For example, the savings from the polio vaccine, which was introduced in 1955, still produces a $30 billion savings per year, every year. \n",
      "   Medical advances will help cut costs by reducing lost economic output from disability and premature death. For example, new treatments for AIDS--some developed with NIH-funded research--caused the mortality rate from AIDS to drop over 60 percent in the mid-1990s, thus allowing tens of thousands of Americans to continue contributing to our society and economy. \n",
      "   And medical research spending isn't just about reducing the enormous current burdens of illness. The costs of illness may grow even higher if we fail to push ahead with further research. Infectious diseases, in particular, are continually creating new health costs. The recent emergence of Lyme disease, E. coli, and hantavirus, for example, show how nature continues to evolve new threats to health. In addition, dangerous bacteria are evolving at an alarming rate and grow resistant to every new round of antibiotics. \n",
      "   This report extensively shows the benefits of medical research and reaffirms the enormous benefits we achieve from funding the National Institutes of Health in our fight against disease. But there is still a lot more work to be done. I am hopeful my colleagues will take a few moments to look at this report and recognize the important work done by the scientists and researchers at the NIH. It can be read in its entirety on the JEC website at: jec.senate.gov. \n",
      "   Funding for NIH is really about-- hope and opportunity. The challenge before us is great, but America has always responded when our people are behind the challenge. America landed a man on the moon. We pioneered computer technology. America won the Cold War. Now it is time to win the war against the diseases that plague our society. We have the knowledge. We have the technology. Most important, we have the support of the American people. \n",
      "   I ask my colleagues to join me in the effort to double funding for the National Institutes of Health. It's good economic policy, it's good public policy, and most importantly, it's good for all Americans. \n",

      "   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support for the Everglades restoration bill introduced today by my friend, and chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator BOB SMITH. This bill represents a tremendous amount of effort and hard work and I am grateful to all my colleagues who have joined Senator GRAHAM and me in this effort. \n",
      "   Today is an important day in the nearly twenty-year process of restoring America's Everglades. It is important because we are standing at last at the historic juncture between planning and action. It is important because now--at long last--we have a realistic chance of restoring, and protecting for future generations, a unique environmental treasure that is fractured, starved for water, and locked in a steady state of decline. And it is important because the bill we're introducing today represents the cumulative efforts of all those who did the work on the largest and most significant environmental restoration project in our nation's history. \n",
      "   Why does this bill matter? Why are the Everglades deserving of Congress' time and effort? Let me offer a few reasons. This bill matters because in the last century a wonderful, pristine natural system in the heart of South Florida was systematically robbed of its beauty and uniqueness in the name of short-term human interest. This bill matters because the America's Everglades is a national treasure, unique in the world, and deserving of a better fate than what is currently written for it in the laws of this country. Our bill matters because we Floridians--after years of acrimony and conflicting goals--have come together behind a balanced plan that fully reconciles the needs of the natural system with those  of the existing water users. And the restoration matters--to us, as legislators--because past Congresses caused this problem, and we in our generation should fix it. \n",
      "   It has been well documented how the Congress in 1948--acting under the pressures of the day--authorized the systematic destruction of the Everglades in the name of flood control, urban development, and agriculture. That is history and we cannot change that. Instead, we must respond to the needs and priorities of our own generation, and pass this good bill to restore America's Everglades. \n",
      "   Let's be clear, Mr. President. Passing this bill, this year, is all that remains between the long years of study and the actual restoration of America's Everglades. The administration has done their part in devoting a tremendous amount of time and effort on the document before you. To Governor Bush's credit, the State of Florida has already written this plan into Florida's laws and arranged funding for Florida's share of the cost. There is only one task remaining: we in Congress must pass this plan, this year, and let the work of restoration begin. \n",
      "   I urge my colleagues to join with me in supporting the bill we're introducing today. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. \n",

      "   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I begin by saying to my friend, Senator DODD, how much I appreciate his comments at the beginning of his speech to the Senate. I appreciate the relationship we have developed. Certainly, one of the things I will truly miss as I leave the Senate at the end of this year is the relationships that have been developed and the opportunity to expand on those relationships with others. Again, it has been a delight. However, we do have very strong differences of opinion on this issue. \n",
      "   I will begin by pointing at the chart that has been put up next to Senator DODD. There is one very fundamental difference. Each of those leaders reached out; they wanted to bring about change. We have seen absolutely, positively none of that from Fidel Castro. There is no indication--not an iota of evidence--that Fidel Castro wants to change. \n",
      "   Later today, we will be voting on this amendment to the Defense Department authorization bill, which is designed to establish a commission to review and report on the United States policy toward Cuba. \n",
      "   I have spoken with many colleagues recently about this amendment and the idea of forming a commission. I understand from some Senators that they have concerns that they want a chance to discuss regarding Cuba. But the goal of those Senators seems to be either broad sanctions reform or the enactment of specific changes in our policies toward Cuba. But today we are debating an amendment on forming a commission. \n",
      "   This commission is blatantly political, in my opinion, so much so that no serious effort can come from a commission designed to be so skewed. This commission accomplishes nobody's goal. \n",
      "   Let me make three points: First, we don't need a national commission to study only Cuba sanctions; second, we should not tie the hands of the next President to set his own Cuba policy; and, third, we should not set policy through a partisan commission outside of the normal conduct of foreign policy by the executive branch. \n",
      "   The legislation on which you are being asked to vote establishes a 12-person panel to review and report on various aspects of Cuba policy. But this is why we have a Foreign Relations Committee in the Senate, an International Relations Committee in the House, and a U.S. Department of State. Why are we making Government bigger and more expensive than it needs to be? Especially, as my friend from Connecticut has argued, this amendment does not take a position or implement a policy.  \n",
      "   Let me highlight a few of the details. This commission is appointed as follows--and, again, I note that my friend indicated this is not a partisan issue, but we who have been around here for a long time all know these issues end up being influenced by politics. \n",
      "   What we are going to have is a commission of 12 people, 6 appointed by the current President. The current President will put six members on a commission to tell the next President what his policy toward Cuba should be. And there will be three from each House--two majority, one minority. That means two-thirds of the commission would be appointed by Democrats; that is, 8 of the 12 members of the commission would be appointed by Democrats. One-third, that is, four members of the commission, would be Republicans. That is not the way to set foreign policy. \n",
      "   Our current policy, set by the State Department and the President, has been endorsed by the Congress over the years with significant legislation. The only reason for this special commission is to try to change current policy through abnormal means. \n",
      "   Let me talk for a moment about American foreign policy in general. I hear the rhetoric often that, after 39 years, clearly, our Cuba policy has not brought democracy to Cuba and therefore it must be abandoned as a failure. Think about that argument for a moment. What if Ronald Reagan had come into office and declared in 1980: After 40 years, since there is no democracy in the Soviet Union, our Soviet policy must be abandoned? \n",
      "   Reagan did the opposite. He had the courage to call the Soviet Union what it was, an ``evil empire.'' His courage and commitment brought democratic reform to Russia. America's foreign policy must reflect America's commitment to the principles we believe in: freedom, democracy, justice, and respect for human dignity. \n",
      "   My friend from Connecticut has stated that the policy is aimed at one man, Fidel Castro, but it denies basic necessities to the entire 11 million people of Cuba. The reality is that Cuba can purchase goods from the entire world. By closing the American market to Cuba, we are denying the people nothing. Fidel Castro keeps Cuba poor, not the United States embargo. \n",
      "   By maintaining the current policy, however, of isolating Fidel Castro, we are doing as a Nation what we have done for so many generations: We are standing shoulder to shoulder with \n",
      "   people struggling for freedom. We are standing for truth and dignity and supporting heroes when we oppose Fidel Castro and deny him the means to build up his resources. \n",
      "   Since trade has been an important issue of discussion lately given the pending vote on trade with China, perhaps some more detail would be helpful on the differences between China and Cuba. \n",
      "   Simply stated, China began policy changes and economic reforms as early as 1978. Today, they continue to open their economy, seek engagement in the community of nations, and look for investment and trade. \n",
      "   Let me tell you about Cuba. I will provide details from a study conducted by the University of Miami: Cuba does not permit trade independent from the state; most of Cuba's exportable products to the United States are produced by Cuban state-run enterprises with workers being paid near slave wages; many of these products would compete unfairly with United States agriculture and manufactured products, or with other products imported from the democratic countries of the Caribbean into the United States; Cuba does not permit individual freedom in economic matters; investments in Cuba are directed and approved by the Government of Cuba; it is illegal for foreign investors to hire or fire Cuban workers directly and the Cuban Ministry of Labor does the hiring; foreign companies must pay the wages owed to their employees directly to the Cuban Government in hard currency; the Cuban Government then pays the workers in Cuban pesos, worth one-twentieth of a dollar, and the Government pockets 90 percent of the wages paid in by the investor; Cuba has no independent judicial system to settle commercial disputes. \n",
      "   In short, Fidel Castro has failed to make any of the changes made by Beijing. An investment in China today can empower a Chinese middle class and move power away from the center. An investment in Cuba today benefits Fidel Castro and disadvantages the 11 million people struggling for freedom. It is that simple. \n",
      "   As recently as 1997, Fidel Castro argued against the wisdom of economic reforms and reasserted the supremacy of Communist ideology. In addition, political parties remain outlawed. Dissidents are either exiled, banished to the far reaches of the island, or simply imprisoned. The church continues to complain that the promises made during the Pope's visit have not been complied with. The daily activities of the average Cuban citizen continue to be monitored by the state's notorious ``neighborhood watch committees,'' known as the Committee for the Defense of the Revolution. These have been in place for 40 years and continue in place today. Amnesty International counts at least 400 prisoners of conscience, but this does not include the thousands convicted under trumped up charges for political purposes. \n",
      "   I am not simply arguing ideology here today. We have empirical evidence of the failure of the policy recommendation to trade with Cuba; we need only to look at Canada's recent experiences. After arguing for a policy of opening trade with Cuba, our neighbors to the North are now pulling out. I will quote from The Globe and Mail of June 30, 1999:  \n",
      "   The Canadian government had hoped that investing directly in the Cuban economy by building plants and infrastructure would not only deliver an economic return, but also lead to wider-ranging reforms. Those hopes have been largely dashed as Canadian companies report woeful tales of pouring good money into bad investments in Cuba.  \n",
      "   Mr. President, policies of so-called engagement with Castro have failed for those who have tried. We all shared great hope when the Pope visited Cuba in January 1998. The United States promised to respond positively to any changes made by the Castro regime following the Pope's visit. We expected to see more space for the Cuban people: freedom of speech and more freedom of religious expression. We know now that even these hopes have been dashed. The Pope just last December expressed his disappointment in the changes in Cuba. A December 2, 1999 Reuters wire story reports,  \n",
      "   The clear wording of the Pope's speech indicated that the Vatican felt that not much has changed on the predominantly Catholic island in two years.  \n",
      "   We know that President Reagan's wisdom remains true--after 39 years of isolating Cuba, we must not fear calling things as we see them. Fidel Castro is an evil tyrant. He impoverishes the Cuban people in spite of the efforts of many to open the society to freedom and the economy to investment. Fidel Castro denies his people the basic necessities for life, liberty, and happiness. \n",
      "   Mr. President, I do not object to evaluating our policies, but we must be honest, this is not the way. When Cuba changes, the United States must also change. Until then, we must remain committed to our principles, because it is our principles which make us strong. No missile system, no fleet of warships, will keep the United States the shining city on the hill--the beacon of freedom which we all saw when Ronald Reagan was President. I hope that my colleagues will join me. And I hope that they will stand with me for freedom. stand with me for democracy, stand with me for justice, and stand with me for respect for the human dignity of the 11 million people in Cuba. \n",

Currently the Government of the Russian Federation maintains a signals intelligence facility in Lourdes, Cuba from which it conducts intelligence activities directed against the United States.

This is several hundred million dollars flowing to support a brutal tyrant for the purpose of supporting espionage. \n",

      "   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise with my friend and colleague Senator GRAHAM to introduce the Florida Keys Water Quality Improvements Act. This bill is identical to legislation that passed the House on May 4, 2000 by a vote of 411-7, and would provide Federal resources to help improve and maintain one of our Nation's real treasures, the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. \n",
      "   The Florida Keys are a spectacular natural resource of international significance. Within the Florida Keys lies the only living coral reef bed in the United States and the third largest living coral reef in the world. The reef is home to plants and animals unique to this area and that comprise a rare and sensitive ecosystem at the southern end of the Everglades ecosystem. While the spectacular coral reef is the Keys' most popular feature, they are also known for native seagrass beds, lush tropical hardwood hammocks, mangrove forests, rocky pinelands, the endangered key deer, and a wide array of aquatic life. \n",
      "   The Florida Keys marine ecosystem is dependent upon clean, clear water with low nutrient levels for its survival. Water quality experts have found that the inadequate wastewater treatment and storm water management systems are major contributors of pollution in the nearby waters off the Florida Keys. This increased pollution has had devastating effects on the marine environment, and is threatening the reefs on the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. Unless decisive action is taken to stop the flow of pollution, scientists warn the ecosystem will continue its decline towards total collapse. \n",
      "   The source of the problem is clear. The Keys have almost no water quality infrastructure. Lacking adequate technology, untreated wastewater now travels easily through porous limestone rock into the near-shore waters. Polluted stormwater also flows from developed land into the same near-shore waters. \n",
      "   Our bill is a natural extension of the Federal commitment to the Florida Keys made under the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary Protection Act approved by Congress in 1990. This legislation established a Federal role in the research and protection of the Keys marine ecosystem. The Act directed the Environmental Protection Agency and the State of Florida to establish a Water Quality Steering Committee which was charged with developing a comprehensive water quality protection program. In fulfilling this directive, the steering committee worked closely with dedicated citizens, scientists, and technical experts. In the final analysis, it found that inadequate wastewater and stormwater systems are the single largest source of pollution in the Keys. \n",
      "   This bill authorizes Federal assistance to help local officials afford the necessary improvements to protect the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. It establishes a grant program under the Environmental Protection Agency for the construction of treatment works projects aimed at improving the water quality of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. The administrator of EPA, after consultation with State and local officials, would be authorized to fund treatment works projects that comply or are consistent with local growth ordinances, plans and agreements, as well as current water quality standards. Projects funded under this program would be cost-shared, with local sponsors providing a minimum of 25 percent of the project costs. \n",
      "   This bill authorizes $213 million in Federal funding for the deployment of water quality technology throughout the Keys. To make the necessary wastewater improvements, the estimated cost to improve near-shore water quality in the Florida Keys is between $184 million and $418 million. To make the necessary storm water management improvements, the estimated cost is between $370 million and $680 million. The Federal government is not going to bear the entire cost, even though this is a national resource. The State of Florida is obligated to come up with 25 percent cost share. \n",
      "   Moneys authorized by this bill will be utilized to replace the dated, inefficient system of sludge ponds and septic tanks currently being used in the Keys with modern waste and storm water treatment works. By ensuring that the nutrients associated with such wastes are not discharged or released into the surrounding waters, we can prevent further damage to the marine environment and achieve dramatic improvement to the water quality in the National Marine Sanctuary. \n",
      "   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this reasonable approach to maintaining an essential national resource. I hope there will be a broad, bipartisan support for this bill.  \n",

      "   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, let me make just a couple of comments before I give my prepared remarks. \n",
      "   It is interesting how this debate is being engaged rather vigorously so quickly and so early this morning. I remind my colleagues that this is basically this same amendment that was adopted by the Senate 63-35 in the last Congress. \n",
      "   I imagine the reason for it is that all of my colleagues received a letter from the National Education Association, the teachers union, in opposition to this amendment. This letter from the National Education Association on behalf of its 2.5 million members strongly urges opposition to the amendment offered by Senator ABRAHAM and myself. They are opposed to it because it authorizes ``federal funds for [the purpose of] testing of current teachers, tenure reform, and merit pay.'' \n",
      "   I find it interesting that the NEA previously came out in support of testing--NEA President Bob Chase has said the NEA:  \n",
      "   ......wholeheartedly supports and endorses the recommendations of the National Commission on Teaching and America's Future's new report, ``Doing What Matters Most: Investing in Quality Teaching.''  \n",
      "   The report recommends: Teachers should be licensed based on demonstrated performance, including tests of subject matter knowledge, teaching knowledge, and teaching skill. \n",
      "   The report recommends: To encourage and reward teacher knowledge and skill, we should develop a career continuum for teaching linked to assessments and compensation systems that reward knowledge and skill. \n",
      "   That sounds to me like a broad endorsement of the concept of testing teachers to understand where they are with respect to the knowledge they have in the courses they are going to be teaching. I think it clearly indicates the idea of moving away from pay being based on someone's seniority to one based on merit--pay should be based on the ability to teach, the ability to be able to show, in testing, that they have the knowledge in the areas in which they are teaching. \n",
      "   So I make that comment to begin. \n",
      "   Further, with respect to questions about merit pay, again, my colleague already referred to the fact there have been States experimenting with this idea since the late 1960s. But Denver, CO, has a merit pay system. Interestingly enough, the Secretary of Education, Secretary Riley, when he was Governor of South Carolina, endorsed merit pay. \n",
      "   In Florida, we encourage teachers to participate in what I believe is the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards. If a teacher in the State of Florida successfully completes that process and becomes certified by this board, they are going to receive a bonus. I think that is merit pay. \n",
      "   So this idea that I think the Senator from Massachusetts tried to imply, that this is something no one is pursuing and there is no value to it, I would say, is not accurate. \n",
      "   Mr. President, I rise today with my friend and colleague, Senator ABRAHAM, to offer this critically important amendment. It focuses on the single most important, yet most overlooked, aspect of education--the quality of America's teachers. \n",
      "   Education is the engine of social and economic progress, and the ladder of opportunity. The rungs of that ladder must be supported by exceptional teachers. I have little doubt that the American spirit of ingenuity and innovation will continue to lead the world in providing new economic opportunities, expanding medical research and improving the quality of life for everyone. But there is a catch. For our children and grandchildren to achieve the high standards we expect of them, we must provide them with the tools they need to help them excel. The economic security of our children depends upon the quality of their education. \n",
      "   Each time we debate education reform in America, there is a growing sentiment that continued viability of the American dream could slip away simply because our children are unprepared to face tomorrow's challenges. The academic performance of America's students in international exams can hardly be considered world class. In fact, the longer our students attend American schools, the further behind they fall in performance. Consider these statistics: \n",
      "   While America's 4th graders score above the international average in math tests, they continue to trail students in countries like Austria, the Czech Republic, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, and Singapore. By the 8th grade, American students barely meet the international average, and by the 12th grade, American students lag far behind their international peers. \n",
      "   In science, U.S. students score above the international average in both 4th and 8th grades. But, in 4th grade, U.S. students are outranked by only one country--Korea. By the 8th grade, thirteen countries outrank U.S. students. \n",
      "   Again, that is an indication that the longer they are in school, the further behind they fall with other countries in the world. \n",
      "   In international physics tests, American 12th graders ranked sixteenth, and far behind countries like Russia, Slovenia, Latvia and the Czech Republic. \n",
      "   In both math and science, the performance of U.S. 12th graders is among the lowest in the industrialized world. Of the 21 countries that participate, the United States placed 16th in science and 19th in math skills. \n",
      "   Our students will be denied basic opportunities because they have not been adequately equipped to face a new, competitive, and global economy. We can and must do better. \n",
      "   Without qualified teachers in America's classrooms, all other attempts at reform are meaningless. We have long focused on the need to hire more teachers--as many as two million over the next decade. Our focus shouldn't be on the number of teachers, but rather, on the quality of those teachers. \n",
      "   As long as students are compelled to attend school, we should be compelled to staff those \n",
      "   schools with the best and brightest teachers. Parents all over the state of Florida, and I imagine the same is true around the country, are concerned that the success--or failure--of their child's entire academic year will be determined by the quality and expertise of their child's teacher. Studies show that the most important factor in determining student success on standardized tests is the teacher's ability to present the material. As States are taking important steps to challenge their students with high-stakes tests for promotion and graduation, we must encourage states to step up to the plate and provide students with teachers who are better prepared than ever before. \n",
      "   Further complicating the situation is the shortage of teachers nationwide, which has led many school districts to assign teachers to subjects for which they have no formal training. Four million American students are currently being taught English, Math, or History by teachers who have neither a college major or minor in the subject they are teaching. Four million kids! \n",
      "   Mr. President, maybe I have a slightly different perspective in looking at these numbers today than I would have, say, 5 or 6 weeks ago. Priscilla and I were just blessed with our first granddaughter. We already have three grandsons, but this is our first granddaughter. While all of us in the family are engaged in the early days of raising that little baby and trying to get through the night, we are also concerned about the future for little Addison. Is she going to be among the one out of five students in America being taught English by a teacher who doesn't have a major or minor in English?  \n",
      "   Think about that for a moment. I think one out of four math students are being taught by teachers who do not have a minor or major in that subject. So when I think about little Addison's future, and I realize the competitive world in which we live today, and how much more competitive it is going to be in the future, I know she is not going to be able to compete and have the same opportunities we all have enjoyed if she doesn't have an education second to none. Frankly, that can only come about as a result of having high-quality teachers in the classroom--teachers who my son and his wife, Ann, can be comfortable in knowing have the knowledge and expertise to provide that education. \n",
      "   Requiring secondary school teachers to earn a major or minor in their subjects might make sense if there were not a clearly superior policy that could be adopted instead, such as requiring teachers to pass a subject knowledge test for the subject areas they teach. \n",
      "   Teacher testing is an important first step toward upgrading the quality of instruction in the classroom. Testing provides a valuable opportunity for teachers to demonstrate knowledge of subjects for which they do not hold a major or minor degree. It will also enable principals to evaluate their staffing needs and to staff classrooms with the most qualified teachers. You simply \n",
      "   can not teach what you don't know. \n",
      "   Common sense also dictates that we should not focus solely on under-performing teachers. We must also recognize that there are many great teachers who are successfully challenging their students on a daily basis. Teaching is one of the most important and challenging professions. While many excellent, enthusiastic, and well prepared teachers already work in America's schools, their work often goes unrecognized and unrewarded. Salaries for teachers lag far behind other professions for which a college degree is expected or required, and as a result, many exceptional teachers leave the profession and others who would be exceptional teachers never even consider teaching. \n",
      "   We have created a system of clear incentives for our best teachers to leave the classroom. Instead, we should be enacting policies to keep the best and brightest teachers in the classroom. To do this, we need to evaluate and reward teachers with a compensation system that supports and encourages them to strengthen their skills and demonstrate high levels of performance. That, in turn, will enhance learning for all children. \n",
      "   Today, schools compensate teachers based almost solely on seniority, not on their performance inside the classroom. It rewards underperforming teachers and penalizes exceptional ones by grouping them together in a single pay scale based primarily upon length of service. Merit-pay would differentiate between teachers who are hard-working and inspiring, and those who fall short. It is true that good teachers cost money. But the fact is, bad teachers can cost more because they limit the education of a child and his or her ability to contribute to society. \n",
      "   We hear quite often that merit pay won't work in public schools because it is too difficult to compare the accomplishments between teachers teaching smart, wealthy, well-disciplined, well-fed children versus those teaching poor, inattentive, hungry and unruly children. These conditions are no different than the differences faced by other professionals like doctors or lawyers who face both unwinnable cases or deadly diseases. Teachers should also be rewarded proportionately to their accomplishments in enhancing student learning, attitudes, and behavior. \n",
      "   This is not to suggest that simply throwing more money at schools and teachers will rescue schools from mediocrity. Some suggest we try throwing more money at the problem, although I would point out that we have already tried that. The United States spends more money per pupil than any other industrialized nation, and as I mentioned earlier, our children are not achieving high levels of performance on international standardized exams. The reality is that no amount of money will save mismanaged, bureaucratic, red-tape ridden schools from failure. And no amount of money will rescue a student who is placed in a classroom led by an unprepared, unenthusiastic, and uninspiring teacher. This debate is less about money and more about giving teachers a greater stake in the education they provide. We can do this by offering them real incentives to do their best so that their dedication and expertise will be recognized and rewarded. This will benefit all students. \n",
      "   Our amendment, known as the MERIT Act, will enable states to use their limited federal dollars on a number of initiatives to enhance teacher quality. First, this amendment provides funding for states to develop rigorous exams to periodically test elementary and secondary school teachers on their knowledge of the subjects they are teaching. Secondly, this amendment provides funding to states to establish compensation systems for teachers based upon merit and proven performance. Finally, this amendment provides states with resources to reform current tenure programs. \n",
      "   This broad approach will enable states to staff their schools with the best and most qualified teachers, thereby enhancing learning for all students. In turn, teachers can be certain that all of their energy, dedication and expertise will be rewarded. And it will be done without placing new mandates on states or increasing the federal bureaucracy. \n",
      "   Last Congress, the Senate passed a similar amendment with bipartisan support by a vote of 63-35 during debate on the Education Savings Account legislation. Unfortunately, the President vetoed that bill, despite his previous support for teacher testing. \n",

I hope there will again be broad, bipartisan support for this amendment. I thank the chair and I yield the floor. \n",

      "   Mr. MACK. I thank the Senator for the opportunity to do this. A number of years ago, my wife and I visited a school called the Marcus Garvey School in Los Angeles. I went there because I was trying to learn more about the different types of schools in America--what works, what does not work. While I am going to be talking about the Marcus Garvey School, I am not endorsing or embracing everything the school does. But the thing that stood out to me was the role of the teacher in this school. So this is what happened. \n",
      "   I went to the Marcus Garvey School and met the administrator, the principal, the owner of the school--all one person, Anyim Palmer, who was in a room probably no bigger than 10 by 10, filled with furniture that was probably 35 or 40 years old. The phone was on a stack of papers. There was no secretary. When the phone rang, he answered it. The point I am making is there were not a lot of amenities. This is basic stuff. This is a building with rooms in it, an administrator, teachers, and students. \n",
      "   He said: I want to take you down and show you what some of our students are doing. Unfortunately, the school is not filled today because of the time of the year it is. \n",
      "   Priscilla and I went down to a room where there were three different groups of children being taught in the same room. The first group of students we saw were 2-year-old children. Again, I emphasize 2-year-olds, not second graders; 2-year-old children. There were eight of them sitting at a little table. The teacher said to the children: Show the Senator and Mrs. Mack how you can say your ABCs. You can imagine the cute little voices of those children as they recited their ABCs. When they finished that, the teacher said: Now that you have done it in English, do it in Spanish. So then these little 2-year-old children went through their alphabet in Spanish. When they finished that, the teacher then said to them: Now do the alphabet in Swahili, and they did that as well--2 years old. \n",
      "   We went across the room to where 3-year-old children were doing math problems. The teacher said to me: Give one of the students a math problem. As I would suspect most people would have done, I gave a problem such as 5 plus 8--you know, pretty straightforward. But, again, 3 years old. She  said: No, no, no, give them a tough problem. So I said something like 325 plus 182. And this 3-year-old child, standing at the board, put down little dots, wrote down a number, another series of dots, wrote down a number and got the right answer at 3-years-old. \n",
      "   We went across the room where 4-year-old children were reading. We were told that these children were reading at the second, third, and fourth grade level. They were 4 years old. \n",
      "   We went into another room in this facility where there were 5-year-old children. A little boy was asked to stand up and recite for me, in the proper chronological order, every President of the United States. That little fellow stood up, looked me right in the eyes, and he rattled right through every President of the United States in the proper order. I must admit I knew he did that because they gave me a cheat sheet to look at. He was 5 years old. \n",
      "   Every time we went to a different area and saw these students, these children at work, Priscilla and I would say to this person who was taking us around: How can this be? How can this possibly be? What makes this work? Every single time we asked the question, the answer was: It is the teacher. It is \n",
      "   the teacher. It is the teacher. \n",
      "   Anyim Palmer challenged what was then considered the best private school in Los Angeles County, their sixth grade against his third grade students. I think it was in math and English. You know who won--Anyim Palmer's third grade beat the sixth graders. How did he do it? What he said to me was: It was the teacher. \n",
      "   What I found out later is Anyim Palmer was a public school teacher in California who became so frustrated and angry that the system was failing to teach children in his community that he quit the public schools and started his own school. Do you know what he did? He also trained his own teachers. He said: Forget everything you have learned. I am going to train you. I am going to teach you how to teach. \n",
      "   Again, I thank the Senator for asking me to restate that story. It made a major impression on me. We can talk about all these other things, but we must focus on how to make sure that the teacher standing up in front of our children and grandchildren has the knowledge in the subject they are teaching--this is not fancy. We are not asking for special degrees. I am asking a very simple question. If a teacher is standing in front of my little granddaughter, Addison, a few years from now, I want my son and his wife to know the person who is teaching their little daughter has the knowledge in the subject they are teaching. That does not seem to be an unreasonable request to make. \n",

      "   Mr. MACK. I say to the Senator he is exactly right, there is no mandate. As strongly as I feel about it, I would like to, but I do not think that is our role. I think we can make some serious mistakes by mandating certain things, to say to a particular school district or a particular State they have to do what I say. They might say, what if we put this kind of testing program into effect but our concern is we need more computers. We need more books. We need--whatever. \n",
      "   This is not a mandate. It never has been a mandate. It never will be a mandate, at least as far as the Senator from Michigan and I are concerned. It is merely a statement of importance and it says to the schools if they want to, these dollars can be used for the purpose of developing the concepts for creating tests, developing some merit pay program, or in reforming tenure, all three of which we think can in fact go to the heart of the matter about what is necessary to improve the ability of the teacher. \n",
      "   The inference was made earlier that somehow or another those of us who are talking about this are out to degrade the teachers in this country. That is absolutely a false challenge. Most of us can remember those teachers who made a difference in our lives, who challenged us, who demanded from us that we do better. Each of us responded in a little bit different way. But we understand the importance of having good, quality teachers, and there are a lot of them. That is why we put the merit pay in, to recognize that. \n",
      "   Again, as to this notion that somehow or another if we were to put in place a merit pay system that, highlights teachers who are doing well, and encourages those who are not teaching our children to do better and somehow or another people would know and there would be divisions that would take place, let me tell you something. There is probably not a school in America where every teacher doesn't know who is carrying the load and who is not. You do not need a merit pay program for students and teachers alike to know who the good teachers are. You can just hear the kids talking about it: Boy, I hope I don't get in so-and-so's class. \n",
      "   It doesn't take a merit program. Merit pay is not going to do that. Children and parents already know the good ones and those who are not carrying their load. \n",

      "   They also get a bonus if they encourage another teacher to do the same thing. \n",
      "   What we are saying is, we are recognizing, not only through the dollars but through our interest, the importance of that individual teacher and the importance of the quality of that individual teacher. I believe it would encourage them to stay in the system longer. Most of the teachers love the children they are teaching. They want them to do better.

      "   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, in the early morning hours of Holy Saturday, a little piece of America died. America's shining beacon of freedom faded in the Florida sky as many of us grieved over the astounding actions of the United States Government. This administration betrayed America's past and joined history's inglorious list of governments that have chosen to use excessive force against its own law-abiding citizens. \n",
      "   Our founding fathers believed in a Government of, for, and by, the people, a Government designed to serve and benefit the people, not to serve and benefit the needs of Government, and certainly not to substitute brute force for the rule of law. These are reminiscent of the tactics used by tyrants and despots. The decisions by this administration that led to the events of last Saturday will be remembered as a day of shame in our American history. \n",
      "   My comments today are not directed toward the law enforcement officers who carried out the operation; I understand they are charged with a duty and must follow the directives of the Attorney General and the President of the United States. My comments today are not directed at the ultimate disposition of Elian's residency or custody, and they are not intended to be partisan or political, but they do go directly to the heart of who we are as a Nation and what we expect of our Government. \n",
      "   As most people know, the Elian Gonzalez matter is pending in Federal court. Just last Wednesday, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals ordered that Elian Gonzalez must remain in the United States during the review of his Federal court case. The opinion of the court suggests the INS and the Department of Justice were wrong in not granting Elian an asylum hearing. In the final footnote of the opinion, the court encouraged the parties to avail themselves voluntarily of the Eleventh Circuit's mediation services. The court believed that mediation was an appropriate avenue to resolve this heart gripping situation. \n",
      "   The Attorney General did not listen to the court. She was obsessed with reuniting Elian with his father at any cost. Perhaps she would have been wise to listen to the words of Daniel Webster: ``Liberty exists in proportion to wholesome restraint.'' Perhaps she should have listened to her own words: ``I'm trying to work through an extraordinary human tragedy. And the importance of working through it is that we do so in good faith, without violence, without having to cause further disruption to the little boy.'' This statement was made nine days before the raid. \n",
      "   The night before the raid, mediation between the Department of Justice, the Miami family and Juan Miguel Gonzalez had gone on all night and into the wee hours of Saturday morning. Even as the negotiations continued on the telephone with all parties, agents of the administration dressed in fatigues and masks exploded into the home of Lazaro Gonzalez with machine guns drawn--and one machine gun that was pointed dramatically in the face of a screaming child. \n",
      "   The Government held all the power, and the Government used intimidation to force a family, a loving caring family, into a corner. Remember this is the family originally selected by the Attorney General to care for Elian. \n",
      "   The administration offered ultimatums when fair mediation was needed. This administration resorted to the power of a machine gun to intimidate an American family. What possible benefit could come from this act? \n",
      "   Tactics such as these deserve a full explanation. \n",
      "   Why would the Department of Justice stage a raid when mediator Aaron Podhurst stated that a deal between the parties was ``minutes to an hour away''? Why would they be so impatient with a solution so near? The Attorney General said that they had a window during which to conduct the raid of Saturday through Monday. Why could they not have waited for negotiations to play out. \n",
      "   What credible information existed to suggest this level of force needed to be used? \n",
      "   Another question that deserves fuller explanation speaks to the impact of the raid on the boy. Wouldn't any psychologist or psychiatrist who actually examined the child say this action would further traumatize the boy? But sadly, the INS team of experts never did examine the boy to make an informed evaluation. \n",
      "   How could such tactics possibly be in the best interests of a child who has suffered so much? What right did this administration have to add this trauma to the terrible loss Elian has already suffered? And why did he have to suffer at the hands of the people who are supposed to defend the rule of law, the INS, the DoJ, and the President of the United States. \n",
      "   Let's think for a moment about the decision the father and the Justice Department made in putting Elian's life at risk with the plans for the pre-dawn raid. I have never questioned the father's love for the boy, but I cannot imagine any father would choose to put his son's life at risk a second time. But it is not an unloving father who put his son in harm's way-the father is as much a victim as Elian in many ways. The father had a simple choice: travel to a safe house in Miami and have Elian voluntarily transferred into his custody or insist on remaining in Washington and have the U.S. government seize his son in a violent, dangerous raid. Just as it wasn't the father's decision not to come to his boy's side for the first four months of this ordeal, it was not his decision to remain in Washington, forcing a raid at gunpoint. Castro would not allow the father to travel then and he would not allow him to travel last weekend. \n",
      "   President Clinton promised my colleague Senator GRAHAM that Elian would not be seized in the middle of the night, and now we must ask again, why did he promise one thing and yet do another? \n",
      "   Elian deserves access to all of his legal options, Elian deserves an asylum hearing, and he deserves the protection of U.S. law. Yet that is for another day. The use of force must be dealt with today. Does the end justify the means? Will these means ever be justified? \n",
      "   There have been accusations of playing politics with this issue. \n",
      "   But perhaps we ought to recognize what several of the Attorney General's long-time supporters have said. The four mediators from Miami that were involved in the negotiations with Janet Reno have clearly challenged the administration's characterization of the events of last Saturday. They said they were close to an agreement and felt confident a peaceful solution could have been reached. \n",
      "   We cannot simply sweep these issues away and dispense of them in the name of politics. This is a long, sad story and I'm sure many would wish it would simply fade away. But if we accept and commend the actions of our government for acting hastily in choosing excessive force over peaceful mediation, we have traveled down a very troubling road. We dare not condone such use of force to settle legal disputes. This strikes at the very heart of the balance of power and the integrity of our judicial process. \n",
      "   This child and no child should face the intimidation and trauma of an automatic weapon in his face--especially when perpetrated by the American government--a government that has always stood for freedom and human rights throughout the world. As a father and grandfather, I am heartbroken for the frightened, vulnerable child in that photograph. My hope is that no other administration official utter the words, ``I am proud of what we did'' and instead express regret and sorrow for the trauma and pain suffered by the entire Gonzalez family. \n",
      "   What happened saddens me as an American, a father, and a Senator. Mr. President, last Saturday morning, a little bit of America died in that raid and I hope we never again dim the light of freedom for those who look to us for hope. I yield the floor. \n",

It is of grave concern to me that the United States is currently considering a change in its ``Travel Ban'' policy with Libya, prior to the resolution of the Pan-Am 103 Bombing trial. \n",

Two Libyan intelligence operatives, with prior terrorist activity convictions, are now on trial for the explosion of Pan Am flight 103 in 1988 and the loss of 270 lives, 180 of them Americans. Libya is engaged in one the most advanced Bio-Chemical efforts in the third world, including the acquisition of delivery vehicles. It has repeatedly engaged U.S. military forces, including an attempted missile attack on U.S. military installations in Italy in 1986. \n",
      "   Taking into account its past behavior, we all agree that Libya has a long way to go to become a member of the family of law-abiding nations. Libya must take concrete actions to provide its sincerity. It must show complete adherence to the Pan Am 103 Judicial Authorities in Hague. If a conviction is reached, Libya must accept responsibility for any court judgement and make full payment to all judgement creditors. It is my sense that Libya must prove its vigilant and sincere cooperation in anti-terrorism efforts. \n",
      "   U.S. policy towards Libya must remain balanced. The ``Travel Ban'' is an important tool and should not be abandoned without clear justification. A verdict is not yet at hand; I urge you to await the conclusion of the Pan Am 103 trial, and calculate our steps from there. \n",

      "   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I hope that our colleagues across the aisle will not prevent us from reducing the marriage penalties in the tax code. This bill will provide married couples the relief that President Clinton denied them last year with his veto of the Taxpayer Refund and Relief Act of 1999. President Clinton's action last year increased taxes by close to $800 billion and imposed a marriage penalty on middle class American families. \n",
      "   There is no place in the tax code for marriage penalties. Marriage penalties are caused by tax laws that treat joint filers relatively worse than single filers with half the income. It has of late become common practice to use the tax code for purposes of social engineering, discouraging some actions with the stick of tax penalties and encouraging others with the carrot of tax preferences. But there is no legitimate policy reason for punishing taxpayers with higher taxes just because they happen to be married. The marriage penalties in the tax code undermine the family, the institution that is the foundation of our society. \n",
      "   I view this bill as just a start. Our tax code will not truly be family-friendly until every single marriage penalty is rooted out and eliminated, so that married couples with twice the income of single individuals are taxed at the same rates, and are eligible for the same tax preferences--including deductions, exemptions, use of IRAs and other savings vehicles--as those single filers. This bill is an important step toward that ultimate goal. \n",
      "   The Democrat criticisms of our bill are misplaced. They argue that our bill contains complicated phase-ins, in contrast to their simple approach. But anyone who reads the bill and their alternative would see that this is false. The Finance Committee bill contains percentages in it, sure enough. And it phases in the relief, that is true. But the percentages and the phase-ins are instructions to the Treasury and the IRS, to make adjustments to the tax brackets. The only people who have to make any new calculations under the Finance Committee bill are the bureaucrats who make up the tax tables, not the taxpayer. \n",
      "   By contrast, the Democrat alternative, in phasing in its relief, requires  taxpayers to calculate their taxes as joint filers, then calculate their taxes as if they were single--a complicated process that requires the allocation of various deductions and credits. Next, the taxpayer would have to determine the difference between these two calculations and then reduce this by a certain percentage. That is supposed to be simple? The Democrat substitute adds to the headaches of tax filing and the demand for tax preparers and tax preparation software. \n",
      "   The Democrats also complain that the Finance Committee bill does more than address their narrow definition of the marriage penalty. They invoke the so-called ``marriage bonus.'' But the ``marriage bonus'' is a red herring. What they call a ``marriage bonus'' results from adjustment tax brackets for joint filers to reflect the fact that two adults are sharing the household income. Under the Democrat approach, single taxpayers who marry a non-working or low-earning spouse should pay the same amount of taxes as when they were single, even though this income must be spread over the needs of two adults. \n",
      "   This approach is fundamentally flawed. The Democrat approach would enshrine in the law a new, ``homemaker penalty.'' The Democrats would make families with one earner and one stay-at-home spouse pay higher taxes than families with the same household income and two earners. \n",
      "   But why discriminate against one-earner families? Why would we want a tax code that penalized families just because one of the spouses chooses the hard work of the household over the role of breadwinner? The Democrat alternative discourages parents from staying home with their infant children, and penalizes people who sacrifice income in order that they can care for their elderly parents. That is just plain wrong. \n",
      "   The Finance Committee bill reduces the marriage penalty in a rational sensible way, by making the standard deduction for joint filers twice what it is for single filers, and by making the ranges at which income is taxed at the 15% and 28% rates twice for joint filers what they are for single filers. This recognizes that marriage is a partnership in which two adults share the household income. Our approach cuts taxes for all American families. The Democrats call this a ``bonus.'' We calm it common sense. \n",

Mr. President, I come to the floor of the Senate today to tell a story--a modern day tragedy about a mother, Elizabeth, who so loved her son, Elian, that she tried to bring him to the shores of the United States of America from Cuba--to the shores of freedom. Had she succeeded, she would have joined her family members already in the United States: her cousin  who arrived only last year; her son's great uncle and his family who have been in the United States for many years; and another cousin who has been here for over fifteen years. She would have been reunited with many other relatives who must today remain anonymous for fear of retribution by Castro against those still trapped in Cuba. Instead, she met with tragedy in the Florida straits. Elizabeth died. Her five-year-old son survived. \n",
      "   Let me be a little more specific. On November 21, 1999, a group of 14 Cuban citizens boarded a boat bound for the United States and the shores of freedom. The motor failed shortly after departing and the group was forced to return to Cuba. Think of the anxiety at this moment, having to return after risking everything. The anticipation. The disappointment. The fear. \n",
      "   When the boat returned to Cuba, one of the other female passengers, Arianne Horta, placed her young daughter back on the shore of Cuba. She then wanted to make sure that Elizabeth was positive in her decision to take Elian. And despite the fact that Elian had a father in Cuba, Elizabeth brought her son back on the boat to set sail for the second time that night--seeking freedom on the shores of America. \n",
      "   If you are interested in what Elian's mother really wanted, think about the act of choosing to keep her son on the boat, while Arianne took her child off the boat. This is as clear a message as a mother can send that she wanted freedom for her child. She wanted freedom despite the risks involved, despite a failed attempt to flee hours earlier, and despite the fact that the father remained in Cuba. \n",
      "   Think about that moment of choice for Elizabeth--put my son on the beach and he can live with his father, or keep him with me so we could have the hope of freedom. It is clear to me that she valued freedom above everything. Now think--if that was you, and you died, would you want the child returned to Cuba? \n",
      "   Think of yourself in Nazi Germany. A mother successfully smuggles a child out, but dies in the process at the hands of the Nazis. The father, probably under duress, demands the return of his child. Would we contemplate returning him? Would we return a child under the same circumstances to Saddam Hussein's Iraq? If a mother and child were scaling the Berlin wall and the mother was shot, but the child was pushed over--would we send the child back? Absolutely not. \n",
      "   On the night of November 21, this group of Cuban nationals repaired their boat and set sail a second time. On the following night, the boat capsized. The survivors clung to anything that would float and hung on for dear life. After a day struggling for her life, Elizabeth died. But before she passed on, she told a fellow passenger who did survive, Nivaldo Fernandez, to make sure that Elian touches land, to make sure he touches dry land. \n",
      "   As many of my colleagues know well, if a Cuban refugee reaches American soil they will not be sent back to Cuba. Every Cuban knows that reaching ``dry land'' means they will be free from Castro's iron fist. Elizabeth's dying wish was for her Elian to reach dry land. There can be no doubt about what she wanted for her son. \n",
      "   Mr. President, I come to the floor today with great disappointment--disappointment in this Administration and disappointment in the Attorney General. Elian Gonzalez's mother's death will be in vain and this little boy's struggle for freedom, his struggle to live in America, simply is being dismissed if the boy's best interests and the family's legal rights are not considered. \n",
      "   Many will say that this is a simple decision, the INS and the Department of Justice should merely reunite a father with the son he loves. I think all of us recognize the intense and profound bond between parent and child. It is to be respected and cherished. It is a natural instinct to want to reunite parent and child. But these are by no means ordinary circumstances. I ask the American people to look beyond the headlines, to understand the intense pressure this father is under. It is unlike anything you or I will ever experience in a free America. I have no doubt the father loves his little boy. But how many of us have stopped and thought about why this father did not come to his son the day he was found, exhausted and dehydrated having survived a treacherous trip at sea. Consider why he has not come for almost 5 months to support his son, hug his son, comfort his son. Again, I would suspect it is not out of lack of concern for his boy. I would suspect it is because Castro would not let him. \n",
      "   Is it possible the father wants the boy to remain with his family in Miami and live in freedom? My understanding is that the father knew Elian and his mother were coming to this country and even told other family members that he would get to America if he ``had to do so in a bowl.'' \n",
      "   I can't imagine anyone disagrees with the notion that Castro controls the father's words and actions through duress--through intimidation. The fact is that none of us knows the true wishes of this father. Castro has used this father and son to manipulate both Cuba and the United States. \n",
      "   Today, the United States is not about to reunite a boy and his father, instead we are about to reunite a child and his dictator. And we are doing so against his mother's wishes. We may be doing so against his father's wishes, as well. \n",
      "   Last week, a spokesman of the Cuban embassy stated ``Elian Gonzalez is a possession of the Cuban Government.'' In Castro's Cuba, the state always has the last word in how a child is raised--it does not matter if a parent disagrees. According to Cuban law, any parent who questions the regime or takes any action deemed to run contrary to the revolution's goals could be imprisoned or executed. \n",
      "   Let me quote a former Cuban Government official from a recent Washington Post op-ed.  \n",
      "   Within Cuba, the return of Elian will not be seen as an act of justice by the U.S. government, but rather as yet another victory for the bully-boy tactics of Fidel Castro. This is why the dictator is trying to recover Elian--to convert him into a different kind of symbol--a symbol of the Revolution--even though for that to happen, Elian would have to renounce his mother, the family in Miami that took care of him and even in fact, his father, Juan Miguel. Because upon returning to Cuba, he will not belong to his family. He will be another son of the Revolution.  \n",
      "   If Cuba were a free country, this situation would have been easily resolved. But Cuba is not free, it is a police state. In fact, Article 8 of Cuba's Code for Children and Youth states: ``Society and the State work for the efficient protection of youths against all influences contrary to their communist formation.'' \n",
      "   Make no mistake, in Cuba, Elian will not have a normal childhood. \n",
      "   In Cuba, Elian will be allowed to live with his father until he is eleven; thereafter he will be sent to work in a farm-labor camp for 45 to 60 days per year. \n",
      "   In Cuba, Elian will face compulsory military service until he is 27. \n",
      "   In Cuba, Elian will be indoctrinated in the glories of ``the revolution'' and taught to regard any Cubans who reject Castroism--including his dead mother--as counterrevolutionaries and traitors. \n",
      "   In Cuba, Elian will be allowed to attend college only if his ``political attitude and social conduct'' satisfy the regime in Havana. \n",
      "   Returning Elian to Cuba means returning him to Fidel Castro. When I was a child, my parents had the last word in my upbringing. In Cuba, Castro's wishes carry the day--he can override any parent. Be assured Castro will begin his manipulation of Elian from the day of his return. I can see the images now--parades and banners, welcoming home the young defender of the ``Communist Revolution.'' Elian may remain closer to Fidel than any other child may be forced to suffer. The boy may get better treatment as a result, but this will be only on the surface. This innocent child will be captive--a prisoner in his own homeland. The regime cannot afford for this boy to return to Cuba only to renounce Castro's ways. Elian will be treated, not as a child, but as an opportunity to exploit. His home, his education, his father's salary, everything, will be provided as Fidel dictates. The pathetic efforts of a desperate tyrant to legitimize his method of oppression will make Elian a test. My colleagues, he is a child. Instead of Fidel's cruelties, he needs compassion. \n",
      "   There is a reason Elian's mother and countless others have risked everything and have given their lives in the hope that their children will taste freedom. And while Elian's mother's voice  cannot be heard now, her actions were loud and clear. \n",
      "   I would not be so angry if we were truly reuniting a parent and child. But if we return Elian, the United States will be caving to the demands of the last tyrant in the Western Hemisphere and will be sending a six-year-old boy to a place that Human Rights Watch states has a ``highly developed machinery of repression.'' And the United States will be doing this without providing basic civil rights to Elian--without permitting his legal options to play out. \n",
      "   Instead, our Government is short circuiting justice for political expediency and we will have to live with that. The outrage and fury I feel toward the administration, the Department of Justice and the INS for the manner in which they have handled the Elian Gonzalez case is overwhelming. \n",
      "   The United States is a Nation committed to the principles of freedom, justice, democracy and respect for human dignity. We are a nation built upon a rich diversity of heritage. We celebrate the uniqueness of our roots, family traditions and cultural experiences. And while this rich diversity is the strength of our great country, we, as Americans, share a common bond that is even stronger. That common bond is our precious freedom. Freedom to pursue our dreams, freedom to raise our children, freedom to speak our minds, and freedom from a government that dictates what we say, where we should live, and what we will become. \n",
      "   These principles strengthen our democracy, our nation. These principles are what continue to draw people to America's shores. Our democracy is designed to preserve and protect the rights of the weak and the strong. Our judicial system is designed to promote access to justice for all Americans. But what we have seen in the past several weeks from our own Justice Department in its' handling of the Elian Gonzalez case shakes the very foundation of our American principles. \n",
      "   Instead of defending these principles, this Administration has intimidated Elian's American family with the sheer weight, power, and force of the United States Government. This Administration has chosen to grind down this family's emotions and trample on the family's rights. In the process, the best interests of this boy have been undeniably neglected and his mother's wishes ignored. This Administration's treatment of a young child has evolved into an exercise of cruel and unusual punishment to preserve a pre-determined outcome and to placate an old and bitter dictator. \n",
      "   The United States is a free country. We have a Bill or Rights, a code of laws, and a separation of powers which guarantees no administration shall be able to sidestep the law. We are a country in which the judicial system should be permitted to work without presidential influence for political expediency--and certainly without bringing the mighty weight and power of the government down on the weakest of all people--a child. \n",
      "   But, in the last four months, this administration, our United States Government, has overstepped its bounds. Mr. President, I am disillusioned by the present status of this struggle for freedom. Disillusioned that these calls to honor freedom have fallen on deaf ears. But, then I think of the Cuban parents who so loved their children that they sent them unaccompanied to the United States in the 1960's in what became known as ``Operation Pedro Pan.'' Fourteen thousand and eighty-four children were sent away from the clutches of Castro by their loving parents to go to America to live in freedom. These parents willingly sent their children in order to escape Castro--in order to escape oppression. Many, if not most, of these children had no family in the United States. But they were sent to the United States with their parents wish for freedom--freedom at all costs. \n",
      "   We know Elian's mother sought freedom for her son--and she paid the ultimate price. We know many in Elian's family had already come to the United States; some recently, some long ago. But we have taken the sad, sad action of assuming a man whose very life and that of his family, depends upon the goodwill of a tyrant, has the ability to speak freely. What a tragedy that this man cannot speak openly and freely about his true desire. What a sad day in the history of the United States of America. \n",
      "   Our founding principle--our Declaration of Independence--declares, ``we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.'' We, the inheritors of this legacy, must not force people into tyranny. \n",
      "   I appeal to the President and the Attorney General to resolve this in such a manner that Elian's struggle and his mother's tragic death will not have been in vain. Perhaps we, the United States of America, will realize that if we don't, we are making a tragic mistake in the handling of this case. It is not too late, though, to do the right thing for this little boy. I call on the President of the United States and the Attorney General once again, to consider what is in the little boy's best interest. \n",

I have done that. I am proud that I have done that. Some of those positions have not been particularly popular in my State. But I have always taken that position. \n",

      "   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I come to the floor of the Senate to speak about an incident that occurred just before Thanksgiving Day 1999, when a mother who so loved her son that she tried to bring him to the shores of the United States of America from Cuba. Had she succeeded, she would have joined her family members already in the United States. Instead, she met with tragedy in the Florida straits. The mother died. The five-year-old boy survived. Now, we are being forced to consider young Elian's future. \n",
      "   Today, the freedom sought by a mother for her son is being mocked. Elian Gonzalez finds himself in the middle of a struggle between his Miami family and the Department of Justice, an agency unwilling to consider what is in the best interest of the child, an agency continually impairing a fair presentation of the merits of this case. \n",
      "   I ask my colleagues to open their minds and their hearts and listen to why the current process being used by the DOJ and the INS represents a grave injustice and denies a decision that should be based upon Elian's best interest. Remember when Elian first arrived, the INS stated that the matter was a custody decision for a Florida state family court. Forty-eight hours after Castro threatened the United States, the decision flipped, and continues to bend to Castro's will. Now the administration wants to rush an appeals process to send him back to a country that Human Rights Watch states has ``highly developed machinery of repression.'' \n",
      "   In the past week, the Department of Justice has put unrealistic demands on the family of Elian to expedite the appeal of the federal district court decision. The Department of Justice has repeatedly threatened to revoke Elian's parole and remove the child to Cuba if the family fails to agree to their demand that both sides have an appellate brief prepared in one week. These unprecedented tactics short-circuit and dismantle the judicial process in which an appellate is typically allotted a minimum of 30-60 days to prepare a brief. This is plain and simple--Elian's family's civil rights are being denied. \n",
      "   This past Monday, the family under great pressure filed a motion with the Eleventh Circuit to expedite the appeals process, and still, the government's threats have continued. In a letter sent to the family at 10 p.m. on Monday night, the government demanded that the family's attorneys appear for a meeting on Tuesday morning at 9 a.m. with INS officials to discuss the revocation of Elian's parole. The government has continually dictated the terms of all meetings and has bulldozed over the right of Elian and his Miami family. \n",
      "   Today, the Department of Justice has summoned Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, to a meeting where he is expected by the INS to sign a unilateral demand ``to comply with the instructions of the INS,'' yet the INS has failed to provide the attorneys and the family with what those instructions will be. After all this child has been through, is it too much to ask how the government plans on removing him from the only home he now knows? Should his family agree to having INS agents come to his Miami home and take him? Probably not. But one thing is for sure: they should know the details of what they are agreeing to. \n",
      "   Keep in mind that this same agreement, if signed, destroys any shred of dignity left in our judicial process. It demands that the family's attorneys have a brief prepared to submit to the Supreme Court within 5 days of the appellate court decision, a time line virtually impossible to meet. \n",
      "   In its effort to dictate terms for the family's appeal, the government has betrayed the very integrity for which the Attorney General is charged with defending--equal protection under the law and the right to pursue justice in a free America. In the past week, I've heard justice department officials say they are taking more aggressive action against the family because they want  to prevent them from invoking more ``legal maneuvers.'' These ``legal maneuvers'' happen to be the legal rights of Americans--properly exercised in the middle of an appeals process. These ``legal maneuvers'' are tools in which all Americans are empowered to seek a fair hearing in the United States of America. I find it unconscionable that the justice department would so blatantly express their desire to dictate terms and influence the outcome of this case. \n",
      "   My reason for coming to the floor today is express my sheer frustration and anger in the manner in which the DOJ and the INS has handled this case. The recent acts of these two agencies demonstrate that the administration is no longer interested in resolving this case in a fair, unbiased way. The offer by the Department of Justice is a deeply flawed offer, one that no American would ever accept, one that no person in America should ever have to accept. Elian's mother sacrificed her life for the freedoms of America, freedoms she never had in Cuba, freedoms she never thought our country would deny her son in his moment of need. We should all, despite our views on this issue, be deeply ashamed at any attempt to short circuit justice in order to reach a resolution in the quickest possible way. \n",
      "   In the United States, we stand up to injustice in the world by zealously guarding our laws. We consistently and rightly argue that our strength and power come from our commitment to America's principles: freedom, justice, democracy and the protection of basic human rights. We are a nation founded upon these principles and we remain strong because we defend them. Mr. President, today and throughout the course of Elian's stay in the United States the INS and our Attorney General have not stood up for the one thing they are supposed to defend--justice for all. \n",

      "   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I want to express my strong support for repealing the Social Security Earnings Test for working seniors. Many of my colleagues and I have been working together for the past 12 years to pass this legislation. At long last, the Senate is going to retire the Social Security Earnings Test. \n",
      "   The Social Security Earnings Test is a 70 year old dinosaur of a law which was initiated to insure that Social Security benefits were granted specifically to retired persons. Today, unfortunately, economic reality dictates the need for many senior citizens to continue working in order to achieve a basic standard of living. The Social Security Earnings Test stands as a roadblock to independence for tens of thousands of seniors throughout the United States. Furthermore, America's seniors represent a wealth of talent and skill. A national policy which discourages them from working is simply counterproductive. \n",
      "   Clearly, few other states have been as impacted by the unfair Social Security Earnings Test as the people in my home state of Florida. I've seen first-hand the impact upon Seniors of laws which limit income. We have already seen the impact caused by President Clinton's 1993 tax hike on Seniors, when he raised the Social Security benefit tax from 50% up to 85%. When are we, as a nation, going to stop penalizing success? \n",
      "   It's not a group of greedy millionaires who are being impacted by the earnings test restrictions. It's lower and moderate income Seniors who need some relief from their government to simply survive. In Florida, we are talking about grandparents who live on Social Security plus any outside work they can get. And if you have grandma in the hospital or a nursing home fighting Alzheimer's Disease, and grandpa has go find some work to pay the bills, the Social Security Earnings Test is simply another hurdle they have to overcome. \n",
      "   Several years ago, I was visiting a worksite in Safety Harbor, Florida where I met with a group of working Seniors. I asked them why they were working past the traditional retirement age. Some said they simply wanted to have a reason to get out of the house and do something productive. Others said they needed the additional income to take care of a loved one. Still others said they wanted to maintain a certain lifestyle without Federal interference. \n",
      "   But I was most struck by one gentleman who said to me, ``Senator, we live in a throw away society. Don't let them throw us away.'' What this gentleman was saying was that the message the Earnings Test sends is that society no longer needs you. How can we, as a society, say such a thing? Clearly, we shouldn't. \n",
      "   Finally, consider this thought. Baseball fans might remember my grandfather, Connie Mack, who spent many years in major league baseball. In 1929, he managed the World Champion Philadelphia Athletics. In 1929, he was 66 years old. Suppose he had succumbed to the idea that, at that age, there was no purpose for pursuing one's ideas, one's dreams in life. Suppose he had been told by our nation that he was no longer of value to society. He might not have had the opportunity to produce that great team. Fortunately, we didn't have a law which could have forced him into retirement. \n",
      "   The Federal government is sending a message to working Seniors that they are over the hill. The only thing that is over the hill is the Earnings Test. We need to retire the Earnings Test, not our Seniors. \n",

      "   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks regarding the Risk Management for the 21st Century Act. \n",
      "   Floridians know all too well the impact of natural disasters on the agriculture community. While I am proud of the ability of our growers to rebuild their farms after such devastating losses, enormous disaster aid bills only serve as a band-aid fix to the problem. We must work harder to ensure that all farmers have access to the necessary risk-management tools. This bill encourages growers to purchase appropriate levels of crop insurance, hopefully avoiding the band-aid fix in future appropriation measures. \n",
      "   Florida is the ninth leading agricultural state in the nation, with annual farm receipts totaling $6 billion. The industry employs over 80,000 people and generates more than $18 billion in related economic activity. In 1998, hard working Floridians produced more than 25 billion pounds of food, and more than 2 million tons of livestock feed. I am proud to say that Florida leads the nation in production of 18 major agricultural commodities including oranges, sugarcane and fresh tomatoes. With these statistics in mind, it is imperative to ensure that federal programs work with, not against, Florida's farmers. \n",
      "   As an original co-sponsor of S. 1401, the Specialty Crop Insurance Act of 1999, I support the effort to reduce the dependence of the specialty crop industry on catastrophic loss insurance coverage by improving its access to quality crop insurance policies. By failing to account for the unique characteristics associated with farming specialty crops, current crop insurance policies do not include many specialty crop producers. \n",
      "   Through promotion of affordable crop insurance policies, S. 1401 would increase specialty crop producer participation in the Federal Crop Insurance Program. Today's legislation, S. 2251, the Risk Management for the 21st Century Act, includes many of these specialty crop provisions. \n",
      "   This legislation requires that 50% of the funds dedicated to research and development for the new crop insurance products are focused on specialty crop product development. At a level of $20 million per year, the legislation authorizes the Risk Management Agency to enter into partnerships with private and public entities to increase the availability of risk management tools for specialty crops. The expertise of outside agencies will most certainly help the Risk Management Agency develop sound specialty crop insurance policies. \n",
      "   The Risk Management for the 21st Century Act also includes an expansion of Risk Management Agency pilot authority, removal of the Non-insured Assistance Program (NAP) area trigger, incentives for growers who purchase ``buy-up'' coverage, and it proposes a premium refund for low-risk producers. These reforms will ease our nation's growers dependence on short sighted disaster relief bills. \n",
      "   This bill is the product of countless hours of negotiation, and I believe it represents an incredible opportunity to improve our Federal Crop Insurance Program. The Agriculture Committee has been extremely helpful in including the interests of specialty crop producers, and I thank them for their time and effort. I urge my colleagues to support the Risk Management for the 21st Century Act. \n",

      "   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise in support of amendment 2827. This amendment, cosponsored by Senators HATCH and MURKOWSKI, is very simple and straightforward. It eliminates the marriage penalty in the education savings accounts. \n",
      "   Married couples should not suffer a tax increase just because they are married. The so-called marriage penalties in the Tax Code do just that. Married couples often have to pay higher taxes than the couple would owe if they were single filers. The House has recently addressed this issue in the broader Tax Code, and we will soon do the same. But it makes no sense to have marriage penalties built into newer programs we have created, such as the tax-free education savings accounts. \n",
      "   Under this amendment, as under the administration's HOPE scholarship tax credit and Lifetime Learning credit, the income eligibility for joint filers would be double the amount for single filers. People who qualify for these accounts when they are single should not lose this valuable opportunity to provide for their children's education just because they got married. \n",
      "   When the Senate first passed education savings accounts in the 1997 Taxpayer Relief Act, all Americans  were eligible to use these vehicles to save for their children's education. While that bill was in conference, however, income limits were added to this tax benefit, but these limits injected a marriage penalty into this provision. There is absolutely no policy justification for a marriage penalty in education tax benefits. This should not be a partisan issue. \n",
      "   As I mentioned earlier, the administration's education proposal did not contain a marriage penalty, but the income limits the administration negotiated when the 1997 bill was in conference created a marriage penalty in the education savings accounts. Now is the time for us to eliminate this marriage penalty. \n",
      "   According to my Joint Economic Committee staff, this amendment will allow over 2 million households to establish education savings accounts for their children. \n",

      "   The Joint Tax Committee has estimated the amendment will reduce taxes by only $7 million over 10 years. That is point one. Point two, the reason that is the case is because the individuals who would be affected by this already have the option to use prepaid tuition plans. \n",
      "   Now, there seems to be agreement with respect to tuition tax plans of people of high income, as Senator REID indicated a moment ago. We have all agreed it was fair to them. Why is it not fair to allow the same benefits to derive to them under the education savings accounts as under the prepaid tuition plan? \n",
      "   So, again, the cost is $7 million over 10 years. Roughly 2 million families would be affected, not 20 percent of potential families. It is narrowly focused and it is addressing the issue of a marriage penalty; there is no place in our proposal, the education savings plan, for discriminating against those who are married. \n",

      "   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and my friend and colleague Senator GRAHAM to introduce a resolution contragulating Florida State University's football team on winning the 1999 Division 1-A Collegiate Football National Championship. As a Senator from Florida and the father-in-law of an avid Seminole, I join with all those in my home state and those across this country in honoring Coach Bobby Bowden, his staff, and the football team for this outstanding accomplishment. Not only is this a special achievement that will long be remembered by the coaches and the players but it is also a moment to savor for the students, alumni and supporters of Florida State University. \n",
      "   Florida State University has one of the most exciting, prolific and successful college football teams in the country. In fact, they won 108 football games between 1990 and 1999, more than any other Division 1-A college football team during this timeframe. By finishing the 1999 season undefeated and untied, they have also extended their NCAA Division 1-A record streak of top-four finishes in the final Associated Press poll to 13 years in a row, the only football team to have accomplished this feat. \n",
      "   But as impressive as all these achievements are, they have accomplished what no other football team has been able to do. The 1999 Seminoles are the first Division I-A collegiate football team in the country to be ranked number one for the entire season by the Associated Press since the preseason rankings began in 1950. \n",
      "   1999 will also be remembered fondly by my good friend Bobby Bowden for reasons other than surpassing the 300 victory mark, or winning his second football national championship, or for obtaining his first perfect season in 40 years as a head football coach. In 1999, Coach Bowden and his lovely wife, Ann, celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary. Coach Bowden, Priscilla and I wish you and your wife our sincere congratulations on this most important milestone. \n",
      "   The State of Florida is indeed fortunate to be the home to three of the finest college football teams in the nation: Florida State University, the University of Florida and the University of Miami. Together, these three schools have won seven Division 1-A college football championships since 1984. That's seven college football championships in the last 16 years. This proves that the road to the college football national championship goes right through the State of Florida. \n",
      "   For those who love to wear the Garnet and Gold and do the Seminole Chop and the FSU War Chant, I am honored to introduce this resolution on their behalf, which honors the 1999 Florida State football team, the coaches and staff for winning the Division 1-A Collegiate Football national championship. \n",

      "   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to commemorate four brave Americans. Theirs is a story of courage, it is a story of heroism, and it is a story of freedom. \n",
      "   Four years ago today, on February 24, 1996, Fidel Castro sent Cuban MiG fighters into the Florida Straits and killed Carlos Costa, Armando Alejandre, Mario de la Pen 6a, and Pablo Morales. \n",
      "   These men were members of a humanitarian organization known as ``Brothers to the Rescue.'' These volunteers search the Florida Straits for rafters. Too many Cubans die each year in their flight to freedom. The Brothers try to save lives. \n",
      "   So my thoughts and prayers today are with the families of the brave and courageous humanitarians who lost their lives 4 years ago. I know this day must be especially difficult for the families--today reminds them of the terrible loss suffered, and today also  marks another year passed without closure. \n",
      "   People need to be able to put the past behind them and move on. But when the President and his administration give assurances and advice, and American families trust and obey this advice only to be dragged along and let down, the administration commits a great injustice. \n",
      "   Think for a moment about Armando's sister or Mario's mother, or any other family member. Think for a moment, how you would feel if your brother or son was murdered while volunteering with a humanitarian organzation--killed by state-of-the-art fighter jets flown by the air force of one of the world's last totalitarian dictators? I know the pain for me would be unbearable. \n",
      "   I join with the families today in remembering these brave men. I want to tell their story of freedom, their story of courage, and their story of heroism. \n",
      "   Armando came to the United States from Cuba as a child. He so loved his life here, his freedom, that he joined the U.S. Marine Corps and volunteered for a tour in Vietnam. He volunteered to fight for his adopted home. He survived his tour only to be murdered by Fidel Castro. He was 45 years old. His wife of 21 years and his daughter have now lived with the struggle for justice for 4 years. They are in our thoughts today. \n",
      "   Carlos, a Florida native, was 29 years old when the Cuban government shot him out of the sky. He was always interested in aviation and dreamed of one day overseeing the operations of a major airport. He received his college degree from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University and worked for the Dade County Aviation Department. His parents and sister today are in our thoughts. \n",
      "   Mario, a New Jersey native, was only 24 years old when Castro's MiG's took his life. He was in his last semester at Embry-Riddle, working toward his dream of becoming an airline pilot. His parents and brother are in our thoughts today. \n",
      "   Pablo left Cuba on a raft in 1992, and the Brothers to the Rescue saved his life. Indebted to these heroic pilots, he joined them and began training to obtain his pilot's license. Pablo often talked of his family still in Cuba and how much he missed them. Since his death, there are reports that they have been persecuted and discriminated against. Our thoughts are with his family in Cuba today. \n",
      "   Remember, as you think of these men this afternoon, what they were doing when they lost their lives--they were working to save the lives of others. This humanitarian effort must have so enraged Fidel Castro that he ordered the interception of these small, unarmed aircraft by his huge fighter jets to be blown from the sky with air-to-air missiles. \n",
      "   Two days after their murder four days ago, the President so moved by this tragedy said on national television;  \n",
      "   I am asking that Congress pass legislation that will provide immediate compensation to the families, something to which they are entitled under international law, out of Cuba's blocked assets here in the United States.  \n",

      "   The Brothers' families wanted to understand the new rules before they chose to proceed with any civil suit. They met with officials from the U.S. State Department to clarify the meaning of the new law. \n",
      "   In their meeting at the State Department, the families were told the U.S. Government encouraged them to file the civil lawsuit against the Cuban government. \n",

      "   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, they took the Cuban Government to court. It took a long time, but eventually they won. In December of 1997, almost 2 years ago, a United States Federal court entered judgments against Cuba for the murders of their family members. Justice seemed to be won. The end appeared to be near. But the very same U.S. Government and the same Clinton administration that encouraged the families to postpone closure and pursue legal justice began to oppose them. They entered the lawsuit on the side of Fidel Castro. \n",
      "   I quote from Maggie Khule's testimony of last October before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Maggie Khule is the sister of Armando Alejandre:  \n",
      "   No words can possibly explain our shock when we went to court and found U.S. attorneys sitting down at the same table as Cuba's attorneys. How can you explain to a mother who has lost her son, to a wife who has lost her husband, to a daughter who has lost her father, that their own government is taking the murderer's side?...... The Clinton administration has shut its doors to us. Secretary of State Albright, for example, won't meet with us on any of our other concerns because, to quote an aide, ``We are on the opposing side of this civil action.'' Are we? We thought we were the victims' families, victims ourselves. We thought we were Americans entitled to protection from our own country. We thought Cuba was the terrorist, the guilty party.  \n",
      "   Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to take a moment from their busy schedules today, on this fourth anniversary of the murder of four brave humanitarians, and think about the blight of terrorism and the cost it has extracted from too many families of our country. \n",
      "   Think also this afternoon about what we ask to deter terrorism and promote justice. I want to read one more quote, this time from a Federal judge who heard the case brought by the families against Cuba. After observing this administration's change of position from support to opposition, he states the following in the March 1999 ruling:  \n",
      "   The court notes with great concern that the very President who in 1996 decried this terrorist action by the Government of Cuba now sends the Department of Justice to argue before this court that Cuba's blocked assets ought not to be used to compensate the families of the U.S. nationals murdered by Cuba. The executive branch's approach to this situation has been inconsistent at best. It apparently believes that shielding a terrorist state's assets are more important than compensating for the loss of American lives.  \n",

      "   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill granting Elian Gonzalez American citizenship. \n",
      "   What it means is that the most important decision in this young boy's life will not be made by a political bureaucracy--but by a family court. \n",
      "   Mr. President, neither the President of the United States, his Attorney General, nor the dictator ruling Cuba is qualified to decide the fate of this little boy. The United States is a country of laws, and we zealously believe in the rule of law. Elian deserves access to the legal protections of our family courts. These courts are in the business of considering family cases day after day. And they would consider ``what is in the boy's best interest.'' Today, the only concern of the INS is ``who speaks for the boy,'' not about his future. \n",
      "   The primary purpose of this legislation is to ensure Elian has access to America's family courts: a court that will consider the choice that his mother made when she gave her life for freedom. \n",
      "   Mr. President, we will continue this debate sometime later in the week and make no mistake, I believe that Elian should remain here in the United States where he can live in freedom. But it is not my purpose to make that decision; that is the function of a family court. \n",

      "    Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to address a problem that ought to be a concern to all of us: natural disasters and the exposure of the private insurance industry to catastrophic risks. In my state of Florida, we have a particular concern about hurricane risk, but many areas of the country are exposed to the risks of other major catastrophes--whether they be volcanoes, earthquakes or tornadoes. Increasingly, I am concerned about the state of the private insurance industry and its ability to withstand a major catastrophe--a catastrophe of Hurricane Andrew size ($15 billion in insured losses) or greater. \n",
      "   Today, I am introducing legislation to help address this problem and strengthen disaster protection for homeowners and businesses while protecting the interests of the taxpayer. I am pleased my friend from Texas, Senator HUTCHISON, has joined me in this effort. I believe our approach is an innovative, private-sector solution to the problem of catastrophic risk and I encourage my colleagues to review this proposal carefully. \n",
      "   Consumers of property and casualty insurance must be able to rely on their insurers for protection against the risk of catastrophic loss. However, protection for policyholders in today's system is weak; a major future catastrophe could leave consumers without protection and--if past experience is any indication--the government would intervene to ensure the people in the disaster areas receive timely compensation. It is important to note that current law actually poses a disincentive for insurers to set aside special reserves for catastrophic events. Any money set aside to cover potential risk is considered taxable income. To fix this flaw in America's insurance system, we need to provide incentives for insurers to set aside a portion of their policy premiums in secure reserve funds that will be available to meet policyholder needs in the event of future catastrophes. Our bill does just that. \n",
      "   The typical property and casualty insurance company in the United States is exposed to multiple forms of catastrophic risk. This risk can take the form of major disasters that occur only once in a decade or once in several decades (e.g., severe earthquakes, major hurricanes). These can also be in the form of localized natural disasters (e.g., tornadoes, wildfires, floods, winter storms) that cause unusually large policyholder losses in a region and imperil the ability of smaller insurance companies to help their policyholders in the area. \n",
      "   The nation's exposure to these large natural disasters is staggering. While millions of families and small businesses rely on insurance payments to recover from natural disasters, it is important to remember that--under our current insurance tax and regulatory systems--many private insurers may not be able to pay all claims arising from a major disaster. Hurricane Andrew and the Northridge Earthquake opened our eyes to the country's massive exposure to catastrophic losses. Insured losses in my state from Hurricane Andrew exceeded $15 billion. But if this storm had passed over Miami, rather than Homestead just 40 miles south, insured losses could have reached $50 billion, leaving the Florida economy crippled and more than a third of all insurers in that market insolvent. \n",
      "   There is always the potential for a major disaster in any given year in the United States. Estimates of insured losses from highly probable events range from about $75 billion in California and Florida to $100 billion or more in areas of the Midwest. The Gulf, Intermountain West, and Atlantic states all face exposures of approximately $20 billion or more. \n",
      "   Unfortunately, our current system of tax laws and accounting rules work against consumers and taxpayers because they discourage private market preparation for future major disasters. Present tax laws do not permit portions of consumers' insurance policy payments to be set aside and tax deferred in order to provide for the risk of truly catastrophic loss events. Ironically, our tax system allows insurers to set aside funds on a tax-deductible basis to address disasters that have already happened but it gives them no incentive to prepare for those major disasters that have not yet happened. \n",
      "   Policyholder premiums needed to fund policyholders' catastrophic losses in future years are subject to current tax if not used in a particular year. This diminishes the power of insurers to protect policyholders against future losses. This structure is inadequate for assuring that property-casualty policies will protect consumers from future major catastrophic losses. \n",
      "   The tax law should be revised in order to make accommodation for disaster protection reserves and bring about a more practical, and sensible, system for insurance companies and consumers. \n",
      "   Under the Policyholder Disaster Protection Act, insurers could set aside portions of policyholder payments in a tax-deferred disaster protection fund. Amounts from this fund used to pay for losses from a major disaster would be subject to taxation. This concept is similar to programs presently in place in many other developed countries. \n",
      "   I believe this legislation would result in greater stability for insurers providing catastrophic coverage and fewer insolvencies after a major disaster. A recent study by a major U.S. accounting firm determined that approximately $21 billion in pre-funded reserves would be accumulated within the first ten years of the program.  Also, the tax incentive in the bill will encourage insurers to serve disaster-prone areas in a responsible manner by setting aside funds to pay for major losses. \n",
      "   The treatment of the fund by insurers would be closely regulated. Following is a general description of the provisions of the bill: \n",
      "   Insurers would be able to set aside special tax-deferred reserves to cover potential catastrophic events. \n",
      "   The maximum amount any insurer could set aside in a given year would be determined by reference to each insurance company's exposure to the risk of catastrophic loss events. \n",
      "   Deductible contributions to disaster protection funds would be voluntary, but would be irrevocable once made (except to the extent of ``drawdowns'' for actual catastrophic loss events, or drawdowns otherwise required by state insurance regulators). No company could use these funds to shelter income from taxation. \n",
      "   The maximum allowable reserve for any given company will increase or decrease as they enter or exit lines of business that pose catastrophic risk. \n",
      "   Insurers would only be allowed to drawdown the disaster reserves if the loss event in question is declared an emergency or disaster by certain recognized bodies or government officials (for example, a disaster declared by the President under the Stafford Act) and that losses in a year exceed the specified high level. The amounts distributed from the fund are added to company's taxable income for the year in which the drawdown occurred. \n",
      "   Insurance companies would pay taxes on income generated when funds in the disaster reserve are invested. This income would be distributed out of the fund to the insurance company and taxed to the company on a current basis. \n",
      "   The maximum reserve (or ``cap'') would be phased in at the rate of five percent per year over 20 years. Industry estimates indicate private reserves of $40 billion would be built up over this time. \n",
      "   Various concepts to address the problem of catastrophic losses have been proposed over the years. I look forward to working with all of my colleagues to craft a comprehensive solution to both the short-term and long-term problems presented by the risk of catastrophic disasters. In my view, the private-sector focus of this bill, which puts a strengthened private insurance market for consumers in the forefront of disaster protection, is an approach designed to ensure disaster relief is efficient and cost-effective for taxpayers. While the federal government may still need to provide last-resort safety net for disaster victims, it is important to do what we can to ensure private insurance is available, affordable and secure for those citizens in those areas of the country at risk to a catastrophic disaster. This bill will help to bring precisely that availability, affordability and security to insurance policyholders throughout the country, and I believe it is worthy of support and consideration. \n",
      "   The bill we're introducing today mirrors a bill introduced by Congressman FOLEY and MATSUI in the House of Representatives. It is also supported by taxpayer, homeowner, consumer, business and emergency service organizations, as well as local and state policy makers and insurance organizations. I believe it is a sensible approach and I hope my colleagues will join me in this effort. \n",

      "   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with my good friend Senator GRAMM, chairman of the Committee on Banking, on section 507 of the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999. I want to confirm that section 507 is intended to apply only to the amendments made by subtitle A of title V of the bill, and that section 507 is not to be construed, under any circumstances, to apply to any provision of law other than the provisions of subtitle A. For instance, subtitle A of title V relates only to disclosure of nonpublic personal information to nonaffiliated third parties. This means that section 507 of the bill does not supersede, alter, or affect laws on the disclosure of information among affiliated entities. In particular, section 507 does not supersede, alter, or affect the provisions of the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (or FCRA) regarding the communication of information among persons related by common ownership or affiliated by corporate control, nor does section 507 supersede, alter, or affect the existing FCRA preemption of state laws with respect to the exchange of information among affiliated entities.

And I want to begin my remarks today by congratulating Senator GRAMM, my friend and the chairman of the committee. We would not be here without his hard work, dedication, and skillful negotiation and he deserves the lion's share of credit for the fine bill we have before us today. \n",
      "   We are making history here. It has been 66 years since Congress passed the Glass-Steagall banking act in the depths of the Great Depression. It has been at least twenty years since determined efforts began in the Congress to repeal this outdated law and modernize the country's banking code. Today--finally--we have come to the end of the road. \n",
      "   As we stand on the verge of passing this bill, we have a great view both backward and forward. We can see a past in which the country's financial services industry led the world despite an archaic code recognized by everyone to be insufficient. And we can look ahead into a future that offers the American financial consumer: New and innovative products, better choices, information and service, and workable regulations that allow our financial firms to compete in the global marketplace to an even greater extent than today. \n",
      "   This much-needed legislation modernizing our nation's banking laws is happening none too soon. I want to spend some time talking about the two reasons I believe we're here. The first is the transformation of our economy over the past 20 years, and by extension the remarkable changes in our financial services sector. And the second is the tremendous impact of the technological revolution on the banking industry. \n",
      "   We are currently in the eighth year of the longest peacetime economic expansion in our history. When you look at the data, there is only one conclusion to draw: we are now reaping the economic benefits of the hard decisions on economic fundamentals we made back in the 1980s. Under the leadership of President Reagan, we dramatically lowered marginal tax rates, began the rollback of burdensome and overlapping regulations, promoted openness to trade and investment around the world, lowered interest rates, and defeated the inflation menace that crippled our economic competitiveness. In the 1990s, Congress finally completed the job by producing the first balanced federal budgets in a generation. \n",
      "   You cannot overestimate the impact of these fundamental economic victories on the prosperity the nation is enjoying today. One of my biggest concerns, as I think about the history of this era, is people will be left with the impression that President Clinton's 1993 tax increases created this economic expansion. Nothing could be further from the truth. We must not forget the hard--and ultimately correct--decisions made on fundamental questions like taxes, regulation, interest rates, and inflation in the 1980s that freed up the marketplace and allowed American businesses to capitalize on their inherent advantages. \n",
      "   The country's financial sector has certainly shared in this prosperity. We have witnessed a revolution in the delivery of financial services during the 1990s as the traditional barriers between banking, insurance and securities began to come down. Freedom and our free enterprise system ensured that new financial products and alliance emanated from America to service the demands of the global economy. These products and alliance provide American businesses, investors, and consumers with the ability to secure more easily the capital they need to finance their hopes and dreams. As this new economic and financial dynamic became more clear, it was also apparent our existing banking code was outdated and in need of change. \n",
      "   As part of the new economy, it is hard to overstate the impact of the technological revolution on the financial marketplace. Earlier this year, during hearings on the bill before us, Chairman Greenspan noted the financial sector:  \n",
      "   ..... is undergoing major and fundamental change driven by a revolution in technology, by dramatic innovations in the capital markets, and by the globalization of the financial markets and the financial services industry.  \n",
      "   Indeed, the financial marketplace is changing with lightning speed. In September, we held a high-technology summit at the Joint Economic Committee. One of those who testified before our committee was a \n",
      "   twenty-nine-year-old entrepreneur who created an electronic stock trading network. Nine of these electronic trading networks make up about twenty percent of the NASDAQ market and are posing a serious challenge to more traditional stock exchanges and markets. Mortgages and traditional banking services are available over the internet. And anybody who watches television advertisements knows a new generation od web-based businesses are transforming the traditional image--and, incidentally, the fee structure--of stock brokers and stock trading. These businesses and the many others who have gone online to challenge the existing orthodoxy are prompting sweeping changes in the financial marketplace. And they are creating yet another imperative for this bill. \n",
      "   As the American financial industry seized on technological advances to lead the world into new financial markets and new financial products, they awoke from their long slumber of lobbying wars and turf protection and realized it was in everybody's best interest to pass this bill. If our financial firms are to lead and compete in the world marketplace, they must be able to compete from a position of strength. And they must compete from the foundation of banking laws that reflect the new realities of the world marketplace. \n",
      "   The end game on this legislation was by no means easy. During the eleven months we spent writing this bill, we had to continually strike careful balances between the broad, over-arching goals of the bill and the temptation to tinker with the marketplace and predetermine the shape of future financial products and services. The fast pace of change presents a difficult choice for policymakers. We are often too cumbersome in the Congress to lead, we can be irrelevant if we follow, and some among us believe it could be risky to get out of the way. In the face of this dilemma, some of our colleagues wanted us to anticipate every possible side-effect of this financial transformation and write the laws accordingly. This is just not possible, and the resultant regulatory burdens would have stopped this financial revolution in its tracks.  \n",
      "   In the bill before us today, we tried to embrace the following principles: \n",
      "   First, banks, insurance companies and securities firms should be able to enter one another's business and create a financial dynamic for the next century; \n",
      "   Second, new banking products should be regulated by the regulator that knows them best. \n",
      "   Third, institutions should disclose to customers what they are doing with their sensitive personal information--both within and outside the financial firm. And customers should be able to stop these companies from sharing their information with third parties. \n",
      "   Next, new financial activities conducted through subsidiaries of banks should be conducted so as to ensure taxpayer guaranteed deposits are not threatened. \n",
      "   And finally, the burdensome regulations on banks with respect to community lending should not be increased as a result of what we're doing in this bill. \n",
      "   There are sensible guidelines and I'm satisfied we've created the basis here for a safe, sound and flexible financial industry that will serve the interests of American consumers, investors and businesses well into the future. \n",
      "   As I said at the beginning of my remarks, we are making history here. A hundred years from today, I believe the primary thing people will remember about this Congress is that we finally did the right thing and passed this bill. \n",
      "   Mr. President, I would like to conclude my remarks on a personal note. As I begin to recognize the reality that my service in the United States Senate will end in slightly more than a year, I find I am engaging in the occasional reflection. \n",
      "   During the last 12 years of my 18 years in the Congress, I served on the Senate Banking Committee--the committee responsible for writing and overseeing the laws of the land that regulate the banking and financial industry. This has been special to me because I spent the first sixteen years of my career in the banking business. It was work I enjoyed as the years went by. It was also work I found increasingly frustrating because of the stifling regulatory burden placed on banks by the federal government. It was for these and other reasons I left my position as President and LEO of my bank in Cape Coral, Florida and ran for the Congress. \n",
      "   I will not stand here today and claim the credit for the far-reaching and far-sighted bill before us today. My friend and colleague Senator GRAMM deserves the credit on the Senate side. I nonetheless feel a strong sense of pride and institutional accomplishment for the legacy we are leaving to the United States in passing this bill. It will benefit the people, the industry, and the economy as a whole and it is truly a document we can all be very proud of. I urge my colleagues to support the conference report \n",

      "   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to thank the chairman of the committee, Mr. ROTH, for including in the manager's package an amendment by Mr. SARBANES and myself expressing the sense of the Congress with respect to the issue of debt relief for poor countries. Our resolution simply expresses the desire of this body to work with the President and the international community to forgive the debt owed to us by the world's poorest countries in exchange for commitments from these countries to reform their economies and work toward a better quality of life for their people. This follows on legislation we introduced earlier this month to accomplish this important objective. \n",
      "   Our effort today is premised on the notion that we must help these poverty-stricken nations break the vicious cycle of debt and give them the economic opportunity to liberate their futures. This issue has united people of diverse interests and backgrounds from all around the world. There is a growing sense across the cultural and political spectrum that debt burdens are a major impediment to economic reform and the alleviation of the abject poverty facing the world's poorest countries. And there is increasing certainty that debt forgiveness--if done right--can be a positive force for change in the developing world. Our resolution makes clear that the objectives of debt relief should be the promotion of policies that promote economic growth, openness to trade and investment, and the development of free markets. I am glad the full Senate is joining us in this endeavor. \n",
      "   Today, Mr. President, the world's poorest countries owe an average of $400 for every man, woman, and child within their borders. This is much more than most people in these countries make in a year--in fact more than one billion people on Earth today live on less than a dollar a day. Debt service payments in many cases consume a majority of a poor country's annual budget, leaving scarce domestic resources for economic restructuring or such vital human services as education, clean water and sanitary living conditions. In Tanzania, for example, debt payments would require nearly four-fifths of the government's budget. In a country where one child in six dies before the age of five, little money remains to finance initiatives that would improve the country's economic prospects, its openness to trade and investment, or the standard of living of its people. Among sub-Saharan African countries--many of the very countries we're looking to help in the trade package before us today--one in five adults can't read or write. \n",
      "   Mr. President, the problems in the developing countries that yield such grim statistics will never be solved without a monumental commitment of will from their leaders, their citizens, and the outside world. We cannot solve all these problems today. Rather, we are simply affirming to the world that the small step of debt relief is one that can and should be taken without delay. \n",
      "   The effort to forgive the debts of the world's poorest countries has been ongoing for more than a decade. During this time the international community and the G7 came to the realization that the world's poorest countries are simply unable to repay the debt they owe to foreign creditors. What's more, the payments that are being made are hampering progress toward more free, open, and economically vibrant economies. The external debt for many developing nations is more than twice their gross domestic product, leaving many unable to even make interest payments. We must accept the fact that this debt is unpayable. The question is not whether we'll ever get paid back, but rather what we can encourage these heavily indebted countries to do for themselves in exchange for our forgiveness. \n",
      "   In Uganda, for example, debt relief obtained under the existing debt forgiveness programs has cleared the way for a doubling of classroom size, allowing twice as many children to attend school as before. This type of benefit is real. It is tangible. And it will bring untold benefits to the country in future years. We must do more to encourage these types of programs and debt relief is one vehicle that can help effect real change in the developing world. \n",
      "   Prudent debt relief is in all of our best interests. It is an investment in the commitment of the world's poorest countries to implement sound economic reforms and help their people live longer, healthier and more prosperous lives. \n",
      "   Our amendment today is another step toward this goal and I thank my colleagues for their support. \n",

      "   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the very important trade package that the Senate is currently considering. At a time when our global marketplace is expanding faster than ever, we need to ensure that the poorest countries around the world are not left behind. \n",
      "   This comprehensive package uses trade to promote economic self-sufficiency, at the same time allowing for broader access to American goods and services to these markets. While many believe the economic and financial answer for these underdeveloped countries may lie in direct financial assistance, I believe the answer is found by facilitating direct private investment. \n",
      "   I want to share with colleagues the plight of one of these countries which I experienced firsthand this past weekend. I spent 2 days in Haiti meeting with political, business, and humanitarian groups. \n",
      "   By far, the most dramatic portion of my trip was witnessing the extreme poverty and despair that grips that Nation. I saw the face of an economy suffering from 17-percent inflation and unemployment of between 60 and 80 percent. \n",
      "   Let me tell the story of one little boy I met. Only through a humanitarian organization and through the support of private donations is this 9-year-old boy able to obtain an education. As a tool to economic and democratic stabilization, aid is simply not enough. Many children just aren't able to stay in school. They are required to work in order to contribute to their families' survival. \n",
      "   Again, I make the point that for a good number of the people in Haiti, their per capita income is around $50 a year. A straight calculation of the per capita income is about $500. But if you look at the makeup of that distribution, you can see easily that there are literally millions of people in Haiti who live with a per capita income of around $50. \n",
      "   If these children are to have a future, revitalization and expansion of economic opportunities are needed to reach the goal of economic self-sufficiency. By creating a framework for using trade and investment as a development tool, the United States will be fostering reform at the economic base of these countries, taking direct aim at lowering unemployment and high inflation rates. \n",
      "   This legislation creates this framework by extending enhanced trade benefits to the countries of the Caribbean Basin. Since the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, U.S. imports from Caribbean countries have been at a distinct disadvantage. The measure would build on the existing Caribbean Basin Initiative program, often referred to as CBI, by providing additional trade benefits to Caribbean countries similar to that which Mexico and Canada currently enjoy. \n",
      "   Since its inception, CBI has had a significant positive economic impact on both the United States and the Caribbean countries, helping to promote regional security and stability of our Caribbean neighbors. Opening this market even further, particularly following the recent devastation inflicted by hurricanes, will help to stimulate job growth by increasing exports and expanding market access to these countries for U.S. businesses. \n",
      "   Another important component of this trade package establishes U.S. support for economic self-reliance in sub-Saharan Africa. The United States stands to benefit a great deal from a strong and prosperous Africa. By fostering growth-oriented economic policies, we will help support broader access to African markets for American goods and services. Sub-Saharan Africa makes up a market of more than 700 million people and is potentially one of the largest markets in the world. As economic reforms and market-opening measures spur growth in Africa, it will create new and bigger markets for U.S. exporters. \n",
      "   A particularly sensitive, albeit important, provision included in both the African Growth and Opportunity Act and the Caribbean Basin Trade Enhancement Act deals with textiles. The textile and apparel industries have historically provided the first step toward industrialization in many countries. This is because production is fairly simple, can be done on a small scale, and often uses locally abundant raw material. \n",
      "   In seeking to address the concerns raised by the U.S. textile industry, this legislation has sought compromise by restricting preferential treatment to apparel produced by U.S. fabric and yarns. \n",
      "   Additionally, this legislation provides strong protections against illegal transshipment of goods through Africa  or eligible CBI countries. We need to ensure that these countries do not become stop-over points for products from countries not eligible for preferential treatment under the legislation. \n",
      "   International trade has been an important part of the growth we have enjoyed in the United States. Since 1994, international trade has created more than 11 million American jobs, and accounts for 30 percent of our Nation's gross domestic product. \n",
      "   Imports have helped to hold down inflation, lower the cost of production, provide greater choice to consumers, and have given incentives to raise productivity. \n",
      "   As emerging markets seek to grow, it is important that the United States take the lead in offering these countries incentives to continue their economic reforms. By doing so, we will be providing the citizens of these emerging countries with more jobs, more opportunities and genuine hope. I believe a strong trade relationship is the best form of ``foreign assistance'' we can offer another country. \n",

      "   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, Senator JOHN BREAUX, in introducing the Fuel Tax Equalization Credit for Substantial Power Takeoff Act. \n",
      "   This bill would create a simple mechanism to reimburse owners of concrete mixers and sanitation trucks for the Federal excise taxes that they pay on fuels used to power the off-road function of their vehicles. \n",
      "   Today, IRS regulations impose the Federal fuels excise tax on ``single engine, dual-use vehicles.'' Two prominent examples of such single-engine, dual-use vehicles are concrete mixers and sanitation trucks. The IRS taxes the entire amount of fuel used in these vehicles, despite the fact that a substantial portion of the fuel consumed is used to power an off-road function--the trash compactor of a sanitation truck, or the rotating drum of the cement truck. \n",
      "   Mr. President, the Federal fuels excise tax is meant to pay for our Nation's roads. If fuel is used for an off-road purpose, it is a well-established principle that we do not tax the fuel. In this case, fuels used to power the trash compactor or rotate the drum on a concrete mixer do not result in wear and tear on the roads and, therefore, should not be taxes. \n",
      "   Contrary to this well-established principle, the IRS imposes the excise tax on single engine, dual-use vehicles. The simple reason given by the IRS for this distinction is administrative convenience. But the convenience of the IRS is no reason to overtax diesel fuel consumers. \n",
      "   Mr. President, our bill corrects the discrepancy created under IRS regulations, and does so without creating any administrative red tape. The $250 income tax credit crafted in the bill would be easy to administer. While it will not fully and precisely compensate these truck owners for the taxes paid on fuel used off-road, this credit has been calculated based on industry data and using conservative estimates, and reduces a tax that these truck owners should not be paying in the first place. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to join Senator BREAUX and me in supporting this important piece of legislation. \n",

      "   Mr. MACK. Madam President, as Congress considers various plans to overhaul the current campaign finance system, I think everyone can agree on one fact: the status quo is indefensible. The system needs to change in order to restore the American people's faith in their government. \n",
      "   The imbalances which exist in our election laws today were created by the Federal Election Campaign Act in the name of equality. They resulted in unfair advantages which are institutionalized in the name of fairness, protecting some forms of political speech while criminalizing others. Enacting more laws along the same lines will only lead us further down the path of destruction. Freedom matters. Freedom works. Free speech works. Free participation works. The current system does not. If we want real reform, we will scrap this bill, repeal current law, and start over. \n",
      "   Campaign finance reformers think the solution is new regulations and methods that I believe work only to preclude participation in politics. They believe that new laws, more restrictions, and additional bureaucracy are the answer. This position is based upon the assumption that current laws are working and they just need a few modifications to make them better. I  strongly disagree. Freedom of expression is an end in itself and can not be subordinated to any other goals of society. Information is the backbone to freedom, ignorance is the backbone to oppression. \n",
      "   Reformers tolerate these inequalities because they believe they will result in lower-cost elections, less influence in the process by special interests, and will make the electoral system more accessible to challengers. Even if these goals could be achieved in this way, the trampling of the First Amendment in the process is unacceptable. \n",
      "   The fact is, current laws do not work. Let's admit that. We wouldn't be debating this issue if they did. They were passed in haste, as a knee-jerk reaction to the Watergate era, and while they were enacted with good intentions, their result has been a disaster. We should recognize that a mistake was made when the Federal Election Campaign Act was enacted, and no modifications to this law will improve the system. \n",
      "   Campaign finance laws restricting free speech should be repealed, and the absolute freedom to engage in the political process should be promoted and defended. The American people should know that their participation is encouraged, respected, and welcome. If that participation includes fully disclosed contributions to candidates and parties, so be it. Disclosure is the key factor here. Let's give the American people some credit. They are smart enough to judge for themselves where conflicts of interest lie. They do not need the bureaucracy of the Federal Elections Commission to police their speech and thwart their involvement. The only job of the FEC should be the posting and reporting of all contributions in a timely manner so that the American people can judge for themselves. Current law is an insult to the intelligence of the American people. \n",
      "   Soft money is perceived as a loophole in current law. Banning soft money is only one more step toward the elimination of free speech in elections. The First Amendment right to freedom of speech is not a loophole. It is a fundamental freedom that protects, among other things, political speech. Again, let Americans \n",
      "   decide whether and to what extent they want to participate. \n",
      "   We should be protecting freedom of speech over everything else. We should not enact legislation to preclude the public from voicing their opinions on the work we do here. We may not like what is said about us, but we can all agree that people have a right to speak their mind, especially their political mind. \n",
      "   This bill also recognizes that current law does not protect working Americans' ability to decide which causes they will support. While this bill codifies the Beck decision which enables non-union workers to request a refund for the portion of their union fees used for political causes. If it does not address the concerns of union members who are forced to participate in political causes without their consent. \n",
      "   No American should be faced with the direct or indirect threat of losing their job because of their political beliefs. No one should be forced to participate in advocating for a cause or causes they find repugnant. The rights of individuals to be free certainly extends to their political beliefs and the way in which they choose to participate or not to participate. No forced participation under any guise should be tolerated or encouraged. Let individuals make choices for themselves. That is the most fundamental freedom in a democracy. \n",
      "   A vibrant democracy depends on the ability of all voices to be heard, and how loudly one may wish to speak should be limited only by that individual, not by government. If an individual can and is willing to expend over $1,000 in support of a candidate, they should be able to do so. If they wish to express their support with their time or in any other fashion, then this, too, should be applauded and encouraged. And if individuals wish to ignore the political process altogether, then this, too, is a right to be defended. To tinker with this fundamental right gives power to some at the expense of others. \n",
      "   Finally, I would submit, that we need to re-examine our attitude toward money in the electoral process, and I would propose that spending money to communicate one's message is not the root of all evil in politics. Candidates for public office have the important task of getting their message out to the voters. In statewide races across the country, candidates must spend substantial amounts of money for print and electronic media, since it is the best current method of reaching the maximum audience. \n",
      "   Take a moment and think about the power of the media today--television, newspapers and radio frame the debates of important issues. A candidate must be able to raise enough money to get his or her message out to the public. \n",
      "   When I was campaigning for my Senate seat back in 1988, I faced enormous opposition from the newspapers. Newspapers have vast resources to openly campaign for a candidate. Had I not had the freedom and ability to counter their message, I would not be a Senator today. \n",
      "   True reform will not strip candidates, parties, or individuals of their ability to counter the messages in the media. True reform should recognize the imbalance current law has created, and would seek to level the playing field between candidates and the media. Remember, the First Amendment protects freedom of the press, but it also protects the freedom of individuals to speak loud and clear. \n",
      "   Madam President, I believe in the First Amendment. Protecting that right must be our primary goal. \n",

      "    Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from Maryland, Mr. SARBANES, to introduce the Debt Relief for Counties Act of 1999. This bill simply forgives much of the debt owed to us by the world's poorest countries in exchange for commitments from these countries to reform their economies and work toward a better quality of life for their people. Our effort today is premised on the fact that we must help these poverty-stricken nations break the vicious cycle of debt and give them the economic opportunity to liberate their futures. I ask my colleagues to join me in this worthwhile effort. \n",
      "   Today, the world's poorest countries owe an average of $400 for every man, woman, and child within their borders. This is much more than most people in these countries make in a year. Debt service payments in many cases consume a majority of a poor country's annual budget, leaving scarce domestic resources for economic restructuring or such vital human services as education, clean water and sanitary living conditions. In Tanzania, for example, debt payments would require nearly four-fifths of the government's budget. In a country where one child in six dies before the age of five, little money remains to finance public health programs. Among Sub-Saharan African countries, one in five adults can't read or write, and it is estimated that in several countries almost half the population does not have access to safe drinking water. \n",
      "   Mr. President, the problems that yield such grim statistics will never be solved without a monumental commitment of will from their leaders, their citizens, and the outside world. That is not what we propose to do here today. Our bill is only a small step in the right direction, but it is one we can do quickly and for relatively little cost. \n",
      "   The effort to forgive the debts of the world's poorest countries has been ongoing for more than a decade. During this time the international community and the G7 came to the realization that the world's poorest countries are simply unable to repay the debt they owe to foreign creditors. The external debt for many of the developing nations is more than twice their GDP, leaving many unable to even pay the interest on their debts. We must accept the fact that this debt is unpayable. the question is not whether we'll ever get paid back, but rather what we can encourage these heavily indebted countries to do for themselves in exchange for our forgiveness. \n",
      "   Our bill requires the President to forgive at least 90 percent of the entire bilateral debt owed by the world's heavily indebted poor countries in exchange for verifiable commitments to pursue economic reforms and implement poverty alleviation measures. While roughly $6 billion is owed to the United States by these poor countries, it is estimated the cost of forgiving this debt would be less than ten percent of that amount. The U.S. share of the bilateral debt is less than four percent of the total, but our action would provide leadership to the rest of the world's creditor nations and provide some savings benefits to these countries as well. \n",
      "   Our bill also requires a restructuring of the IMF and World Bank's Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC). This program was begun in 1996, but to date only three countries \n",
      "   have received any relief. While the premise of HIPC is sound, its shortcomings have become evident during the implementation. It promises much, but in reality it benefits too few countries, offers too little relief, and requires too long a wait before debt is forgiven. A process of reforming the HIPC was begun this year during the G7's meeting in Cologne, and our bill meets or exceeds the standards set out in the Cologne communique. \n",
      "   Specifically, we shorten the waiting period for eligibility from six to three years. We extend the prospect of relief to more countries. And we ensure that savings realized from the relief will be used to enhance ongoing economic reforms in addition to initiatives designed to alleviate poverty. This is a sound and balanced approach to help these poor countries correct their underlying economic problems and improve the standard of living of their people. \n",
      "   Mr. President, this legislation is not a handout to the developing world. Rather, it is an investment in these countries' commitment to implementing sound economic reforms and helping their people live longer, healthier and more prosperous lives. In order to receive debt relief under our bill, countries must commit the savings to policies that promote growth and expand citizens' access to basic services like clean water and education. \n",
      "   We have included a strict prohibition in our bill on providing relief to countries that sponsor terrorism, spend excessively on their militaries, do not cooperate on narcotics matters, or engage in systematic violations of their citizens' human rights. We are not proposing to help any country that is not first willing to help itself. \n",
      "   Mr. President, the debt accumulated in the developing world throughout the Cold War and into the 1990s has become a significant impediment to the implementation of free-market economic reforms and the reduction of poverty. We in the developed world have an interest in removing this impediment and providing the world's poorest countries with the opportunity to address their underlying economic problems and set a course for sustainability. \n",
      "   I believe our bill is an important first step in this process and I look forward to the support of my colleagues in the Senate.  \n",

      "    Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend and colleague Senator ABRAHAM, to introduce the Merit Act, which is legislation to ensure that every classroom in America is staffed with a competent, qualified and caring teacher. Last Congress, the Senate debated a number of initiatives to further this goal and passed this legislation as an amendment to a comprehensive education reform bill, which was vetoed by the President. Earlier this year, I joined Senator GREGG in cosponsor the Teacher Empowerment Act. Both the TEA, and the MERIT ACT are important reform bills to enable local schools to staff their classrooms with the best and brightest teachers. \n",
      "   The 21st Century begins in just under 100 days. If our children are to be prepared for the challenges ahead, educational excellence must become our first order of business. As Congress continues to focus on a number of important reforms to federal K-12 education policy, I strongly believe that any real education reform must confront the most basic, the most important, and the most neglected aspect of public education: the quality of instruction in the classroom. \n",
      "   Parents all over the state of Florida, and I imagine the same is true around the country, are concerned that the success --or failure--of their child's entire academic year will be determined by the quality and expertise of their child's teacher. Studies show that the most important factor in determining student success on standardized tests is the teacher's ability to present the material. Studies also show that when a student is assigned an ineffective teacher, the damage is not limited to one year. In fact, student test scores do not recover for three years, even if their subsequent teachers are excellent. \n",
      "   America's classrooms are staffed with many dedicated, knowledgeable, and hardworking teachers. Nevertheless, the case for sweeping reform is not difficult to make. While the United States already spends more money per pupil than virtually any industrialized democracy in the world, our children frequently score near the bottom in international exams in science and math. Without exceptional teaching, no amount of resources will be able to turn bad schools into good schools. Throwing more money at the problem is no longer the answer. \n",
      "   Our schools and classrooms should be staffed with teachers who have the appropriate training and background. Students deserve teachers with a thorough knowledge of the subjects they are teaching and the ability to convey complex material in ways that students can understand. One way to determine the competency of teachers would be to test them on their knowledge of the subject areas they teach. \n",
      "   At a time when states are raising the bar for student achievement, few are raising standards for teachers. Today, seven states have no licensing exams for new teachers, and of the \n",
      "   43 states that do have licensing exams, only 29 require high school teachers to pass an exam in the subject they plan to teach. However, in many cases, these requirements are waived when there is a shortage of qualified candidates. \n",
      "   We have a clear interest in ensuring that beginning teachers are able to meet high standards and are knowledgeable about the subject matter they are presenting, and a number of states have taken the initiative to test their prospective teachers. However, when you consider that many teachers--especially teachers in low income districts--do not even have a minor degree in the subject they teach, it is important to periodically evaluate the performance of all teachers. Schools are often strapped for good teachers and will simply staff a science class with a math teacher. These are cases where testing could provide valuable insight as to the mastery of the teacher in additional subjects, and would identify those teachers who need additional encouragement. \n",
      "   Common sense also dictates that we should not concentrate all our attention on under-performing teachers. We must also recognize that there are many great teachers who are successfully challenging their students on a daily basis. Today, our public schools compensate teachers based almost solely on seniority, not on their performance inside the classroom. Merit-pay would differentiate between teachers who are hard-working and inspiring, and those who fall short. \n",
      "   The legislation we are introducing today, known as the MERIT ACT--which stands for Measures to Enhance Results in Teaching --is the same legislation that passed the Senate last Congress with bipartisan support by a vote of 63-35. It rewards states that test its teachers on their subject matter knowledge, and pays its teachers based on merit. \n",
      "   Here is how it works: we will make half of any additional funding over the FY 2000 level for the Eisenhower Professional Development Program available to states that periodically test elementary and secondary school teachers, and reward teachers based on merit and proven performance. There will be no reduction in current funding to states under this program based on this legislation. As funding increases for this program, so will the amount each state receives. Incentives will and should be provided to those states that take the initiative to establish teacher testing and merit pay programs. \n",
      "   Again, I want to emphasize that all current money being spent on this program is unaffected by this legislation. Only additional money will be used as an incentive for states to enact teacher testing and merit pay programs. \n",
      "   Finally, this legislation enables states to also use federal education money to establish and administer teacher testing and merit pay programs. This broad approach will enable states to staff their schools with the best and most qualified teachers, thereby enhancing learning for all students. In turn, teachers can be certain that all of their energy, dedication and expertise will be rewarded. And it can be done without placing new mandates on states or increasing the federal bureaucracy. \n",
      "   It is interesting to note that as Governor of the State of Arkansas, Bill Clinton enthusiastically supported teacher testing, and as Governor of South Carolina, Secretary of Education Richard Riley advocated a merit-pay plan. In fact, then-Governor Clinton in 1984 said that he was more convinced than ever that competency tests were needed to take inventory of teachers' basic skills. He said, ``Teachers who don't pass the test shouldn't be in the classroom''. While President Clinton vetoed this legislation last year, I am hoping he will stand by his State of the Union address where he stated that new teachers should be required to pass performance exams and all teachers should know the subject matter they are teaching. \n",
      "   I would also like to mention the important steps being taken by schools around the country to address the need for merit-based pay. Most recently, in Denver, Colorado, schools have reached an agreement with the unions to commence a two year demonstration program which will pay teachers based on  performance. It is important to note the two largest unions, the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers, have approached the Denver plan with an open mind. In this program, teachers can earn an additional $1500 by the end of an academic year if a majority of the teacher's students ``improve.'' I am encouraged by the initiative taken by Denver's schools to implement innovative approaches to teacher compensation, and I look forward to the continued cooperation of America's teacher unions. Without their cooperation, reforms to education in America are often frustrated. In the end, I believe teachers, administrators, parents and students will be able to devise a system that is fair and one that works to improve teacher and student performance alike. \n",
      "   I look forward to working with my colleagues as we continue the fight to give dedicated professionals who teach our children a personal stake in the quality of the instruction they provide. I hope there will again be broad, bipartisan support for this bill.  \n",

      "   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, Senator GRAHAM and I rise again to introduce the Florida Coast Protection Act of 2000. This legislation will amend current law to give states the ability to have all pertinent environmental information on hand before they are forced to rule on oil and gas drilling development plans, and it would also implement a permanent ban on leasing in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico. \n",
      "   Mr. President, Floridians have always been justifiably concerned about the prospect of oil and gas exploration in the waters off our coast. We are well aware of the risk this activity poses to our environment and our economy because, in Florida, a healthy environment means a healthy economy. Millions of people come to Florida each year to enjoy the climate, our beaches, and our fine quality of life. The tourism industry in Florida provides millions of jobs and generates revenues in the billion of dollars. It would take only one disaster to end Florida's good standing as America's vacationland. We cannot afford to let that happen. \n",
      "   Throughout my tenure in the Senate I have opposed exploration and drilling off Florida's coasts. My goal--and the goal of the entire Florida Congressional delegation--is to permanently remove this threat from Florida's coast. In recent years, we have stood together in opposition to drilling and have successfully extended the annual moratorium on all new leasing activities on Florida's continental shelf. While the opposition of Floridians to oil drilling is well-documented, the reality remains that leases have been issued, potential drilling sites have been explored, and it is likely that actual extraction of resources could take place within the next few years. \n",
      "   In order to prevent a repeat of the past mistake of leasing in the OCS off Florida, our legislation makes permanent the ban on any new leasing activity within 100 miles of our coast. In addition, it gives states the flexibility to make a determination regarding the consistency of oil and gas development and production plans as required by the Coastal Zone Management Act after an environmental impact statement detailing the direct and cumulative impacts of the project is completed by the Minerals Management Service. \n",
      "   It is this second provision which is so important. Many in this body may not be aware that my state is currently engaged in a battle to keep drilling rigs off its coasts. In the process, the government of the state of Florida was forced, by current law, to make a consistency determination on a pending development plan without the benefit of the environmental impact statement. In fact, the state was forced to conclude that the plan is inconsistent with its own coastal zone management  program months before the environmental impact statement was concluded. As I stand here, the EIS for this development plan is still not finalized and its draft is currently the subject of public hearings. Without the benefit of this detailed study, the state is unable to accurately assess the primary, secondary and cumulative impacts drilling will have on our coast, estuaries, marine life and our economy. No state should be put in a similar position and our bill seeks to correct this. \n",

      "   Mr. President, the vote on our tax relief bill is nothing less than a vote of confidence, reaffirmation of our belief in the wisdom of the American people and of our faith in the capitalist system. It all boils down to one basic, fundamental question: who has first claim on the income of Americans--does it belong to the government or to the individual families who create the income through the sweat of their brows and the genius of their (brains?) \n",
      "   The President and the vast majority of our friends on the other side of the aisle act like the money belongs to the  government. They reject our tax relief bill as ``too big,'' as if taxpayers earn income at the sufferance of the government. Under this view, Uncle Sam does not live under a budget he sets the budget for every American family, which must be content with the table scraps after the enormous appetite for spending in Washington has been satiated. \n",
      "   Two and one-quarter centuries ago, the rejection of this arrogant, government-comes-first theory of taxation was the impetus for the founding of our Nation. Our political forefathers would not stand for the notion that Americans were mere pawns of a distant court, which could raid their purses and pocketbooks at any whim. America was founded not on concepts that divide peoples, such as race, or geography, but on the American Idea that brings us all together: the inalienable right to liberty. \n",
      "   From our Nation's very conception, this idea has served as a beacon for people of all creeds and colors seeking refuge from he heavy hand of meddlesome government. In America, the government serves the people, and must necessarily trust the people to do what is right by and for themselves. The government should not try to do it all. We provide a safety net for the least fortunate, those who cannot help themselves, but everyone else is trusted with the responsibility of providing for their own financial security. \n",
      "   And by all accounts, this combination of liberty for our citizens and restraint on the part of the public sector has, in fact, succeeded. By the end of the 19th Century, America was in the forefront of the Industrial Revolution. By the mid-20th Century, despite the MIRE of a worldwide depression, the United States was able to mobilize its industries and its men to rout one own of the twin evils of tyranny in the Second World \n",
      "   War. And by the close of this Century, we succeeded in defeating the other Soviet Communism, by the force of our will, the commitment of a strong Commander-in-Chief, Ronald Reagan, and the power of our competing idea of liberty. Our Nation is President Reagan's shining city on a hill, the economic envy of the world and the destination of all who yearn for freedom. \n",
      "   But this President and his supporters in the Congress just don't get it. The tax burden on our citizens is at an all time, peacetime high--20.6 percent of the economy. Meanwhile, the federal government will be overcharging the taxpayers by more than $3 trillion over the next 10 years. A Nation that trusted its people, that protected their liberty, would not flinch from the right thing to do: cut taxes so that our families can enjoy the fruits of their labors, instead of greedy Washington programs. This tax bill does just that, leaving $792 billion in the hands of the people to whom it belongs. \n",
      "   This tax cut is a measured, balanced response to the surpluses that will be flowing into the capital. It leaves 75% of the surpluses to be used to retire debt, and finance important priorities like Medicare and national defense. Every penny in the Social Security trust fund is left in a lockbox to be used to shore up the retirement security of our citizens. And the tax cuts are phased in over time, so the bulk of the cuts are in the last 3 years of the coming decade, when surpluses would otherwise skyrocket and tempt a government spending spree. \n",
      "   But voices are raised in opposition to the tax cut. It is said that the government cannot afford a tax cut of this size. But that is exactly backwards: our taxpayers cannot afford to continue to shoulder a record-high tax burden. Back in 1993, without the vote of a single Republican member of Congress, President Clinton pushed through a tax increase totaling $241 billion over 5 years. The rationale for this tax increase was the need to reduce our budget deficit. Well, the budget deficit is gone and we now have surpluses as far as the eye can see. The on-budget, non-Social Security surpluses will exceed $1 trillion over the next decade. We propose to let the American people keep $792 billion of these overpayments. Is that too much? \n",
      "   Not when you consider that the 5-year tax cut of $156 billion pales in comparison to the Clinton tax hike, imposed \n",
      "   on what was then a much smaller economy. According to my Joint Economic Committee staff, the 1993 Clinton tax increases will take some $900 billion from the American people over the next decade. Our tax cut of $792 billion does not even offset the lingering ill effects of that tax hike. Are we being too generous? Or have the taxpayers been too generous for too long? \n",
      "   It is hard to find fault with the specifics of our tax cut package. Is it right that we should double-tax business investments, so our innovators lack the resources for research and development? Is it wrong to extend the R&D tax credit, to liberate our scientists and engineers? Is it right that people should pay higher taxes just because they are married? Do we want people to build their own nest eggs for retirement security, or do we want to force everyone to rely exclusively on the Social Security system? \n",
      "   This tax relief package helps everyone. We make health and long-term care insurance fully deductible, and allow a dependent deduction for elderly family members. Education is more affordable through enhanced savings vehicles--IRAs and pre-paid tuition plans. Tax rates are lowered across-the-board. We eliminate the marriage penalty for taxpayers in the lowest tax bracket and repeal the Alternative Minimum Tax for individuals. \n",
      "   Most significant is what this tax relief does for our future. As we enter the 21st Century, America needs a tax policy that will facilitate, not smother, innovation and new technology. Our tax relief bill improves the environment for pioneers in new products and services. The R&D tax credit is extended for 5 years--the longest extension ever, so business can count on it. The R&D credit will continue to fuel innovation in new technologies, leading to health and safety breakthroughs, and enriching our quality of life. \n",
      "   Capital gains tax rates are also cut to their lowest levels in 58 years. Lower taxes on capital gains will help our entrepreneurs find the seed capital they need to launch new businesses, create new jobs and provide new products and services. And capital gains are indexed, eliminating the tax on phantom gains due to inflation--ending the government raid on the savings of long-term investors, particularly retirees. \n",
      "   We also eliminate the most unfair tax of all, the estate \n",
      "   and gift tax. No longer will business owners be discouraged from reinvesting their hard-earned profits because the specter of the federal death tax is hovering, waiting to swoop down and scoop up 55 percent of the increased value of the business. By eliminating the death tax, cutting the capital gains tax, and expanding IRAs, some of the largest barriers to capital formation are pulled down, and the result should be a rising tide of investment that carries our economy through the coming Century of Knowledge. \n",
      "   I want to commend Chairman ROTH, and all of the conferees, for producing a balanced, thorough, and fair tax cut that benefits all taxpayers. High taxes are an infringement on the liberty of our families, who should not be struggling to make ends meet while their Federal servants hoard the wealth our families have created. When the question comes down to whether we trust the Federal Government or the family to use money wisely, I choose the family every time. I urge my colleagues to do the same, to side with the people, not the bureaucracy, and vote for the conference report. \n",

We had joined with the President in requesting slightly more than $100 million for land acquisition in Everglades National Park, state assistance grants, infrastructure investment, and modified water deliveries to the Park and Florida Bay. This funding is critical to keep the restoration effort on budget, on schedule, and consistent with the Congress' commitment in 1997 to fully fund Everglades restoration. \n",

      "   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join my colleagues, Senator MIKULSKI, Senator WELLSTONE, and Senator GRAMS, in sponsoring the Medicare's Elderly Receiving Innovative Treatments (MERIT) Act of 1999. \n",
      "   This legislation ensures that frail elderly persons residing in nursing homes continue to have the opportunity for improved quality of care and better health outcomes provided by the EverCare program. This program is reimbursed by Medicare on a capitated fee basis to managed care organizations that deliver preventive and primary medical care geared to the special needs of this population. Care is given by nurse practitioner/physician primary care teams which also coordinate care when the patient is hospitalized. Ideally, as much care as possible is provided at the nursing home thus preventing the expense of hospitalization. A major goal is to maintain stability in the patients' life by caring for them in their place of residence. The typical patient is over 85, 82 percent are female, 75 percent are on Medicaid and 70 percent have dementia. \n",
      "   The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) requires the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) to establish a new risk-adjusted methodology for payments to health plans which is to go into effect on January 1, 2000. An interim risk adjusted payment will be based on inpatient hospital encounter data. However, an unintended consequence of this methodology may be a dramatic drop in EverCare payments by more than 40 percent, according to Long Term Care Data Institute study. This would jeopardize the program, which is currently comprised of demonstration and non-demonstration components, since providers could not afford to remain in business. HCFA recognized the possibly of this and did grant an exemption from the interim methodology for one year, 2000-2001. HCFA, however, has not yet presented a methodology that would be fair and adequate to ensure the continuance of EverCare. \n",
      "   This legislation exempts programs serving the frail elderly living in nursing homes from the phased in risk-adjustment payment methodology and continues payments using the current system. It directs HCFA to develop a distinct payment methodology which meets the needs of these patients and to establish performance measurement standards. It also allows the frail elderly to join EverCare on a continual basis without regard to enrollment periods. \n",

      "   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition to the amendment before us today by the Senator from Mississippi. While I know my friends who support this amendment have the best of intentions in offering the agricultural relief package, I must say I am concerned with the direction of this debate. \n",
      "   We find ourselves today, Mr. President, in an increasingly familiar place. Once again, there is a crisis in farm country and the Congress is called on to construct a comprehensive package of relief and support. The amendment before us would spend more than $7 billion on--among other things--direct cash payments to farmers. This follows our efforts last year when we provided just short of $6 billion in emergency payments to America's farmers. Since 1988 emergency supplemental acts and farm disaster acts have amounted to approximately $17 billion in emergency supplemental funding for USDA programs. \n",
      "   Now I understand that much of this money was spent helping farmers who had suffered crop losses through drought, seasonal storms and other natural disasters. In fact, a portion of last year's emergency appropriations went to farmers who were harmed by weather conditions related to the El Nino phenomenon and other acts of God. \n",
      "   In other words, we were attempting to help farmers in previous years because times were bad. What concerns me about this effort today is that we are helping farmers because times are good. Increasingly in these relief bills we are seeing the bulk of support going in response to low commodity prices. In fact, much of the rhetoric we're hearing is going to the issue of declining farm income and the difficulty farmers in the heartland and elsewhere are having finding markets for their goods. \n",
      "   Today we're not addressing a crisis borne of declining productivity. It is not that America's farmer's aren't extremely good at what they do. Rather exactly the opposite. We are here because--stimulated by science and technology--farm productivity has persistently grown more rapidly than other sectors of the economy. More importantly, agricultural productivity has outstripped demand. And it leaves us faced with the one of the most basic economic functions: in the face of overwhelming supply and insufficient demand, prices will fall. \n",
      "   In nearly all sectors, this phenomenon is a quiet one. The ``unseen hand'' of the market in most cases allocates resources among the population and prevents market saturation. But in the farm sector, Congress is often asked to intervene in this process and all too often in the past, we have. For far too long, we have allowed politics rather than economics to allocate agricultural resources and determine business success or failure. As seen by the overwhelming failure this century of centrally planned economies across the globe, political allocation leads to economic stagnation and long-term failure. \n",
      "   It is for these reasons I fear our continued subsidization of the farm sector thwarts the free market process and will ultimately harm well-run farms by enabling continued market saturation. I understand the production of food is essential to the past and future of our country. I also recognize the instability and risk farmers face on a year to year basis and appreciate the need for occasional assistance. The New York Times, for example, contains an article yesterday discussing the drought disaster facing farmers in Maryland and West Virginia and the need for assistance in those areas. I do not discount the need for federal disaster relief. In Florida, Agriculture is a major part of our economy, and certainly there have been circumstances when we've called on Congress to assist us after hurricanes or winter freezes. These natural events warrant Congressional consideration and our best efforts. However, it seems our debate here is increasingly about politics rather than economics or weather-related disasters. \n",
      "   In 1996, the Congress passed a Farm Bill which provided farmers of our major export crops with direct payments to transition them off the old subsidy programs and onto the free market. These direct payments were supposed to diminish each year until 2002. Instead, we are here--for the second year in a row--considering legislation to increase these payments. Once again, Congress is using emergency payments to undo the 1996 Farm Bill and circumvent the free market. I hear my colleagues blaming the free market for price failures and I find this to be a somewhat misguided notion. In fact, the market is working all too well; the overcapacity in agriculture that was papered over by government price supports for generations is now in full view. And the results are evident in the low commodity prices we're seeing on the markets today. \n",
      "   I support the ideals and practices of family farming. I do not, however, support continually subsidizing businesses that fail. This is wasteful and destructive. By paying farmers who are unable to make profits in farming, you only delay their ultimate failure, and deter them from seeking other alternatives for income and employment. In addition, these farms that would otherwise fail still can produce crops that dilute the market and drive prices down, thereby creating a vicious cycle that we are seeing realized in this year's crisis in farm country. \n",
      "   This problem far outstrips any two-day debate on emergency cash payments for farmers. What we need, Mr.  President, is long-term structural solutions that solve the underlying problems of oversupply in the face of insufficient world demand. One major impediment to the movement of people out of the farming sector and into other areas of the economy is the punitive capital gains taxes owed by farmers who sell their land. I will be introducing legislation soon to repeal the capital gains tax on the sale of farmland. This will allow farmers to realize an additional dollar in five on the sale of their land. They can then use this money to help them in the transition to non-farm businesses or work. While I agree with my colleagues that we need solutions to the crisis in American agriculture, I submit we need solutions that solve the underlying economic problems rather than patchwork measures that do little more than treat the symptoms and defer the problem to another year and another Congress. \n",
      "   Mr. President, my opposition to this amendment is not based on a disdain or lack of appreciation for American agriculture. On the contrary, I believe it is a vital part of our economy and food security is clearly in our national interest. But the farming way of life is not served by government handout and bailouts of alarming size and regularity. Rather--like most other businesses--it is only preserved through sound business practices, hard work and an understanding of market fundamentals. Agriculture does not operate outside of the laws of supply and demand, and I urge my colleagues to carefully consider the long-term impact of continual subsidization on this important sector of the American economy. \n",
      "   I hope my colleagues will oppose this amendment and explore ways to help farmers who are facing natural disasters rather than price disasters. We cannot allow the short-term politics to deter us from the long-term effort to steer agriculture towards the free market. Nobody wants to see failure in America. Nobody wants to see families lose their farms. Nobody wants the agrarian way of life in America to fade from existence. For these very reasons, Congress has an obligation to stay the course and lay the free-market groundwork for a prosperous farm economy. \n",

      "   First, I want to address a point that was made a few moments ago, an argument that went something like this: If we were to open up our markets, that action would, in essence, allow terrorists or countries to buy more food products. I just think that is fundamentally wrong. I think in fact they are buying all of the product that they can afford to buy now. And I would make the case that if they buy the product from us at a cheaper price because of it being subsidized, we are in fact subsidizing terrorist states. \n",

      "   Mr. MACK. Again, I say to my colleague who has raised this question that I do find it strange that at just the time when Members are coming to the floor and asking the American taxpayer to come to the aid of the American farmer, they are at the same time asking us to lift sanctions to allow them to sell products to terrorist states. \n",
      "   I think, in fact, there is a connection between what is happening today--that is, some $6-$7 billion, depending on what this bill finally turns out to produce, $8-$9 billion in aid to American farmers, just after a few months ago with the additional aid to the American farmer--that you would find it appropriate to say to the American taxpayer: Now that you have given us this aid, we would like to have permission to sell our product to terrorist countries. I just find that unsupportable. \n",
      "   I thank the Senator for raising the question. \n",

      "\n",
      "106-mack-fl-4-19990803\n",
      "\n",
      "   Mr. MACK. It clearly is a subsidy to the American farmer. What kind of effect it will have on the world price I do not think I am qualified to say. But it seems to me it is clear that if in fact there is a subsidy being received by the American farmer, that farmer could sell the product at a lower price.  \n",
      "   I thank the Senator for his question. \n",
      "   Mr. President, I oppose trade with tyrants and dictators, and I emphatically oppose subsidized trade with terrorist states. Again, make no mistake, that is exactly what this amendment does. Specifically, with my colleagues from Florida, New Jersey, and the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, we oppose the amendment to prevent any action by this body to limit the President of the United States' ability to impose sanctions on terrorist states. \n",
      "   We had a similar vote last year, in which 67 Senators voted to oppose trade with terrorists. At the risk of stating the obvious, let me try to explain once again why the Senate should not change this position. \n",
      "   Freedom is not free. I know my colleagues understand this simple axiom--this self-evident truth. But today we hear from our colleagues that the farmers of our Nation are undergoing a difficult time. So today, they have put before us a fundamental question: Does this great Nation, the United States of America, support freedom, or do we support terror? \n",
      "   A few weeks ago, as I was preparing a statement on another issue, I came across a letter from His Holiness, the Dalai Lama of Tibet. In this letter the Dalai Lama says, and I quote, ``America's real strength comes not from its status as a `superpower' but from the ideals and principles on which it was founded.'' \n",
      "   How may times have my colleagues been with me when a visiting head of state delivered to us the same message as the Dalai Lama's? I will provide one example. \n",
      "   Last summer, the President of Romania addressed a joint session of Congress. He began his remarks by reminding us that Romania considered the United States the country of freedom and the guardian of fundamental human rights all over the world. He went on to say:  \n",
      "   Throughout its history, your country has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed and the needy, a source of inspiration for the creative, the courageous and the achieving. It has always been, and may it ever remain, the land of the free and the home of the brave.  \n",
      "   We are a nation founded on principles--the principles of freedom, liberty, and the respect for human dignity. And our commitment to these principles gives us our real strength today. It is that simple. \n",
      "   I began this statement by posing a question on freedom versus terror. We know, even take for granted, the answer to that question--the United States opposes terror. But what about the strength or our commitment to these principles? On occasion, a short-term crisis can blind us--cause us to lose sight of our values and their importance to who we are and from where we derive our strength. \n",
      "   Today's debate typifies one such moment. The poster which has been shown on this floor indicates the issue before us with respect to terrorist nations and their leaders--Qadhafi, Castro, and others. \n",
      "   In exchange for very limited market expansion, some would take away the President's authority to restrict trade with six terrorist regimes--six countries whose combined markets represent a mere 1.7 percent of global agricultural imports; yet these minor importers perpetrate or harbor those who commit the world's greatest acts of terror. \n",
      "   Some would have us open trade in agricultural products with these terrorists--in effect placing our principles up for sale. So what is the strength of our commitment to these principles? If we are to choose freedom over terror, what price should we expect to pay? There can be no doubt in anyone's mind the value of our commitment to freedom certainly exceeds the U.S. share of 1.7 percent of the world's agriculture market. \n",
      "   But for those who may actually find this less clear than I do, it gets easier. The request by those who wish to trade with terrorists gets more extreme. With this amendment to language providing subsidies of U.S. agriculture, we are in effect being asked to subsidize global terrorism. The supporters of this amendment are asking the taxpayers of the United States to subsidize American farmers, who will then sell to terrorist states. \n",
      "   The United States must not subsidize terrorist regimes. I find it unconscionable that we would even consider such a proposal. When two countries engage in a trade, even if just one commodity is being exported, both countries benefit from the exchange. So by opening agriculture exports to Iran, Sudan, Cuba, Iraq, Libya, and North Korea, we are offering direct support to the regimes in power. If they chose to purchase from the United States, they would be doing so because they see it as being in their best interest. Their benefit would be greater in this case because the products sold to terrorists would be subsidized by the U.S. taxpayer. \n",
      "   Terrorism poses a direct threat to the United States. The terrorist threat was considerable during the cold war when the Soviet Union and its allies often backed movements or governments that justified the use of terror. The threat is even greater today, when chemical or biological weapons, no bigger than a suitcase, can bring death and devastation to tens of thousands of people. \n",
      "   The deaths in the World Trade Center bombing or in Pan Am 103 remind of us what terrorism can produce. Another important reminder is the image of American humanitarian aircraft being blown out of the sky by Cuban Air Force MiG fighters in the Florida Straits. We are moving from a world where terrorists use dynamite or rifles to one where they may use a weapon of mass destruction. The world today is more dangerous in many ways than it was 10 years ago, and the form of that danger is terrorism, which makes it even more dangerous for the United States to engage in trade with terrorist states. \n",
      "   So where does this leave us? With this simple principle--the United States must not trade with any nation that supports terrorism in any way, direct or indirect. We must insist that there can be no business-as-usual approach to nations that threaten our national security and national interests. We are well aware of the counterarguments. If we don't sell, some other country will, so what is the point? Or why not sell food? You can't turn wheat into a bomb, can you? Well, maybe not, but it is possible for a government that supports terror to use our food exports to win popular support, and it is possible to use the money saved by purchasing subsidized American goods for yet more terror. \n",
      "   We can all agree that the United States must stand for freedom and against terror, and I hope the strength of our commitment to this principled stand runs deep. Today we are being asked how deeply are we committed to opposing terrorism. Make no mistake, our principles provide the real source of America's strength. If we are serious about battling terrorism, there can be no compromise with terror and no trade with terrorist nations. \n",

I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this legislation, which responds to several critical needs facing American education. In particular, it addresses teacher quality and quantity. It addresses local control of educating our children. It requires accountability to parents and students. In short, it is a plan to ensure that every child in America is prepared for global competition in the 21st Century. \n",
      "   The Teacher Empowerment Act recognizes the expertise of our state and local governments in educating our children. American parents trust their teachers and principals to make appropriate educational decisions for their children. In reality, Washington bureaucrats have called the shots for far too long. The results indicate that in lieu of achievement, we now have reams of paperwork and a myriad of programs to address local problems at the national level. We can and must do better. \n",
      "   The Teacher Empowerment Act puts decision making authority back into the hands of local schools. It encourages states to implement innovative teacher reforms and high quality professional development programs to increase teacher knowledge and student achievement. Local schools would be encouraged to fund innovative programs such as teacher testing--a concept which I have strongly supported and which this body supported last year in a bipartisan vote--as well as tenure reform, merit-based pay, alternative routes to teacher certification, differential and bonus pay for teachers in high need subject areas, teacher mentoring, and in-service teacher academies. \n",
      "   Our children are counting on us to ensure that they receive an education second to none. That starts with exceptional teachers and schools that are  able to address the individual needs of its students. This bill returns to local schools the ability and authority to accomplish these goals. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.  \n",

      "   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I would like to talk a few minutes about one particular provision in the tax bill we are debating, the extension of the Research & Development tax credit. Last week the Finance Committee took an historic step, and reported a bill which would have made the R&D tax credit a permanent feature of our tax code. Yesterday, unfortunately, every single member of the minority voted to sunset the provisions of the tax bill, so instead of a permanent R&D tax credit, we have a ten-year extension. \n",
      "   Though the actions of our colleagues across the aisle prevented us from having a permanent R&D tax credit, I am pleased that the on-again, off-again nature of the credit will not undermine America's innovators for the next decade. I have long supported federal policies to increase the nation's R&D investment because of the central importance of scientific research to the health and well-being of our people, its positive contribution to our economic growth and our higher standard of living, and the improvements which add to our quality of life. \n",
      "   Both business and government play important and complementary roles in making sure that America continues to lead the world in research and innovation. The federal role in R&D is focused on investment in long-term basic research. I will continue to do my best to increase federal R&D spending on basic research, particularly on biomedical research which leads to huge benefits to all Americans. \n",
      "   Today, private industry plays the largest role in the nation's research effort, funding 65% of all R&D. Industry's role makes it clear ..... that if overall R&D is to increase, we must pursue policies which create a good business climate for firms to pursue long-term increases in their R&D budgets. We want America's leading-edge companies to hire new scientists, invest in new technologies and new research facilities--and the R&D tax credit provides that crucial incentive. \n",
      "   To see the benefits of R&D, look no further than America's economic performance today. We are in the eighth consecutive year of non-inflationary growth, and technology industries deserve a large share of the credit. In fact, high-tech industries have accounted for about one-third of real GDP growth in recent years. \n",
      "   Advancements from R&D lead to a huge number of improvements to our quality of life. The most dramatic impact of R&D on our quality of life is evident in biomedical research and health care. Here are some examples of the payoff to medical R&D: \n",
      "   It used to be that patients with kidney failure had to undergo frequent transfusions, which are expensive, carry substantial risks, and leave many patients anemic. Many kidney patients had to cut back on work or quit their jobs, or go on public assistance. Through extensive R&D, one of America's top biotech companies created a new drug that allows the body to create red blood cells again and enables people to restore their energy. In the past decade, this drug has helped millions to remain productive. It has reduced transfusions in the United States by nearly one-fifth, and fewer people have contracted blood-born disease. \n",
      "   Another example of the real-life benefits from R&D is the new class of drugs, developed in the late 1980s, which are giving millions of people who suffer from depression a new lease on life. Because of these new depression drugs, the cost of treating depression in the United States has plummeted--expensive psychiatric care and in-patient stays, which many could not afford, are now disappearing in favor of these new treatments. \n",
      "   There are two telecommunications companies which invested in R&D to create new technologies to bring state-of-the-art medicine to previously underserved and remote locations. These new technologies allow transfer of high-resolution photographs, radiological images, sounds, and medical records from leading medical centers to physicians and patients in remote locations. \n",
      "   These are just a few of hundreds of great success stories coming out of America's medical research labs--successes coming from companies responding to the R&D tax credit incentive. These examples make clear that R&D is not simply a dollars and cents issue. Federal R&D policy makes improvements to the quality of life across-the-board for all Americans. \n",
      "   The R&D tax credit has proven its effectiveness. Numerous studies during the past decade have found that each dollar of tax credits generates between $1 and $2 of additional R&D. Therefore, taxpayers are getting a solid return on their investment in terms of greater economic growth, a higher standard of living, and in numerous cases--a longer and healthier life span. \n",
      "   As chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, last month, along with Senator BENNETT, I hosted a high-tech summit which brought together business leaders from all across the high technology industries. One issue everyone seemed to agree on was that a permanent R&D tax credit would advance the development of new technologies, leading to breakthroughs which benefit the environment, increase transportation safety, treat serious illnesses and save lives. And on top of all this, a Coopers & Lybrand study found that a permanent extension to the credit would raise American incomes due to higher productivity growth and contribute substantially to our economic growth. \n",
      "   The R&D tax credit has proven its worth many times over. Mr. President, though I am pleased we have extended R&D for 10 years, it is my hope that the R&D tax credit will one day be a permanent fixture in our Tax Code so it can spur innovation and economic growth throughout the next millennium. \n",

Many of the retirement communities contain fully licensed facilities established to provide skilled nursing services to their residents when required them. Often, people choose a continuing care retirement community because of the different levels of care that will be available to them as they age in that community. These living arrangements allow couples and individuals to maintain their independence by having the ability to move in and out of various levels of care according to their needs over time. People who are fully independent when they move into a residential community often require assisted living, skilled nursing care or some other assistance over the course of their lifetime in residence. \n",
      "   An increasing number of seniors have chosen Medicare+Choice plans as the way that they wish to receive health care services under Medicare. These plans reduce the potential for substantial out-of-pocket costs for the very sick which might be the experience with the traditional original Medicare plan. \n",
      "   One unfortunate consequence of the Medicare+Choice option involves the inability of seniors to return to their chosen community or nursing home where they resided following a period of hospitalization. Some Medicare+Choice plans will only permit patients to be discharged from the hospital to a facility with which the Medicare+Choice plan has a contract. Then, patients cannot return to the residential community that they selected, which may have been chosen because it included a skilled nursing facility. Nor can they return to the nursing home in which they had previously resided. This can be traumatic for frail elderly patients and may contribute to their disorientation and impede their recovery. It places them in an unfamiliar setting away from home, possibly separating them from a spouse and friends. Staff at their chosen retirement community or nursing home may also be familiar with their individual needs and habits which could only assist in their return to wellness. It makes little sense for them to be sent elsewhere upon discharge from a hospital. \n",
      "   Passage of this legislation ensures the ability of Medicare+Choice beneficiaries to return to the residential home facility of their choice or nursing home in which they previously resided following hospitalization under the following conditions: \n",
      "   1. The enrollee chooses to return to the residential community facility where they had been living. \n",
      "   2. The facility is licensed and qualified under state and federal law to provide the required services. \n",
      "   3. The residential community or nursing home agrees to accept the managed care plan's payment which must be similar to the payment made to contracted facilities. \n",
      "   This legislation provides for continuity in the lives of the elderly following a period of hospitalization. It does not increase costs to Medicare+Choice plans or to beneficiaries. \n",
      "   It allows people to return to their loved ones in the facility where they have chosen to live. \n",

      "   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, although I agree with many of the specific provisions in the Democrat alternative tax package--including a few bills that I have introduced--I must rise in opposition to this amendment. The plain fact is that the tax cut offered is just too small. We have budget instructions to cut taxes by $792 billion over the next 10 years, and we should cut taxes by $792 billion. \n",
      "   I am glad I have this opportunity to talk about tax cuts, one of my favorite subjects. \n",
      "   We are in the midst of what should be a very easy task: reducing the tax burden on our citizens by $792 billion over the next ten years. After all, over the next decade, the federal government is on track to collect over $3 trillion dollars more than we have budgeted for spending. \n",
      "   In other words, we will be overcharging the taxpayers by $3 trillion. You would think that the suggestion to return to the taxpayers a mere 25 percent of these overpayments would not be controversial. But we have heard, over the past few months, the defenders of the status quo, the advocates of big government, raise their voices in criticism of our tax cut goal. \n",
      "   These critics say that tax cuts are not needed, that taxpayers do not deserve to keep more of their hard earned money. It has even been suggested that the tax burden on our families has been falling. Well, the facts could not be any clearer: the federal government will tax away 20.6 percent of our nation's gross domestic product this year. That is an all-time, peacetime record, a level that was only exceeded when we mobilized to win World War II. \n",
      "   But even though the tax burden is a record high, even though we will be overcharging the taxpayers by $3 trillion over the next decade, every excuse under the sun is being raised against tax cuts. Some of these arguments are contradictory, and all are wrong. \n",
      "   Some argue, from a Keynesian demand-side perspective, that tax cuts will overstimulate the economy. But even after a $792 billion tax cut, the federal government will run up over $2 trillion in surpluses over the next ten years--from a Keynesian viewpoint, $2 trillion in surpluses is not considered a stimulus. And with all of the lags, the delays, and the phase-ins, the bulk of the tax cuts will not arrive until years 2007, 2008, and 2009. \n",
      "   Can anyone seriously suggest that, in a $9 trillion economy, a $4 billion net tax cut for fiscal year 2000 will overstimulate consumer demand? Or even a $25 billion tax cut in 2001? Would a $39 billion tax cut in 2002 overheat the economy, when this is only .004 percent of projected GDP?  \n",
      "   Clearly, the facts do not support the argument that our tax cuts will overheat the economy. In any event, from the demand-side perspective, the tax cut would be irrelevant. If we do not cut taxes by $792 billion, it is safe to say that spending will increase by $792 billion over the next decade--spending by the government, that is. That is what President Clinton means when he says we cannot afford a tax cut--his bureaucrats are working overtime to dream up new ways to spend the money, as if the government has first claims to the fruits of our citizens' labor. \n",
      "   What kind of spending initiatives can we expect? A few years back, as many of us recall, President Clinton's so-called stimulus package included spending on such urgent needs as building parking garages at the beach, resurfacing tennis courts, researching the sicklefin chub fish, renovating swimming pools, building golf courses, soccer fields, and softball diamonds, and constructing an ice skating warming hut. \n",
      "   Now, the President is not the only source of such wasteful spending ideas--we in Congress are very susceptible to pressures to spend, spend, spend. But no one here doubts for a minute that if the $792 billion in taxes are instead brought to Washington, the money will all be spent. That is one very good reason why we must keep the money out of Washington in the first place. \n",
      "   The argument is also raised that a $792 billion tax cut leaves no money to meet some other important government goals such as debt reduction. But we still have $1.9 trillion in social security surpluses that will be in a ``lock-box'' to retire debt and shore up our citizens' retirement security, and another $505 billion in non-social security surpluses that can be used for Medicare, National Defense, and our other priorities. It is my hope that these surpluses will be used for real priorities, not the ice skating warming huts and beach parking garages. It should be clear that this half-trillion dollars is more than enough to cover our priorities. \n",
      "   The rest of the arguments against our tax relief goal are similarly mistaken. Some people argue that the money is needed to retire publicly-held debt--although, after the tax cut, the remaining 75% of the surplus is available for debt reduction. Even with our tax cut, publicly-held national debt will be reduced from 40% of GDP to just 12% of GDP by 2009. \n",
      "   Other people argue that the Federal Reserve Board would react to the tax cut by tightening the money supply. I have already noted that the very small size of the tax cuts over the next two years--just .0015% of GDP--does not add up to a dramatic increase in consumer demand and, in fact, will not increase demand since government spending would have increased by that same amount were we to collect the taxes. And I will point out that, on many occasion, including today, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has stated that he believes that government spending is the worst possible use of the surpluses, and that he would support tax cuts if spending is the alternative. Furthermore, a tax cut that removes government barriers to savings and investment is not an ``artificial stimulus'' that should worry the Fed one bit. Inflation, after all, is caused by too many dollars chasing too few goods, not by too many investors creating wealth and opportunity. An even stronger economy, fueled by the freedom and enthusiasm of our entrepreneurs, is not something to fear. \n",
      "   It is even argued that a sizable tax cut passed now makes a future economic downturn more hazardous, as if the tax cuts needed for an economic rebound will have already been wasted by our efforts this year. Of course, that argument makes the case for tax cuts, as any tax cuts that would succeed in getting us out of a recession should keep us out of one in the first place. That is why former Fed Governor Lawrence Lindsey considers a tax cut a good insurance policy against an economic downturn. \n",
      "   When you consider all of the arguments, there really is no case against cutting taxes by at least $792 billion. Chairman ROTH is to be commended for sticking to his guns and reporting out of Committee a bill that cuts taxes by that full amount, despite all of the pressure exerted by all of the advocates of big government, who would rather spend the money. \n",
      "   One final point I want to make is that these abstract discussions tend to obscure the real reason we are here. Tax cuts are not about numbers, they aren't about aggregate statistics, they aren't about increasing demand by 4 thousandths of a percentage point--tax cuts are about people. We are cutting taxes because of the 67-year-old owner of a family business in Florida's panhandle, who is discouraged from reinvesting his hard-earned profits because the specter of the federal death tax is hovering, waiting to swoop down and scoop up 55% of the increased value of his business. We are cutting taxes because of the two-earner family, struggling to make ends meet, that has to pay over $1,000 extra in taxes just because they are married. \n",
      "   We are cutting taxes so that waitresses, truck drivers, teachers and carpenters can put an extra $1,000 in their IRAs each year, to build a better nest egg for retirement. We are cutting taxes to enable a biomedical company to budget that one additional research project that just might lead to a breakthrough in the treatment of glaucoma or a cure for cancer. And we are cutting taxes to reduce government barriers to saving and investment, so the capital is available for the American entrepreneurs of the 21st Century to develop markets in technologies we cannot even imagine today. We need to cut taxes to get government out of the way and give people the freedom to pursue their own dream--not Washington's. \n",

      "   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, on this occasion of the almost annual debate on NED, the National Endowment for Democracy, we can and we must declare our commitment to promoting freedom in the world. \n",
      "   Freedom often exacts a price--it indeed is not free. Ronald Reagan understood this when he created NED, as have successive Presidents and Congresses who have consistently funded NED. \n",
      "   Freedom is sacred. It is to be honored, protected, and shared with the world. It is the core of all human progress, and therefore, the spread of freedom enriches us all. \n",
      "   But let us not forget, the price of freedom can be great. Just as we focus in this body these days on our abundance we must not forget those who have come before us; we must not forget in whose shoes we are walking. How many Americans have died; have put their lives on the line in the glorious pursuit of that sweetest of goals--emancipation from oppression and tyranny. We are the direct benefactors of the dedication, selflessness, and even the spilled blood, of countless people.  \n",
      "   Should we be proud of those achievements? Of course, but we must also accept the weight--the responsibility--of this gift. The awesome responsibility which we have inherited. Because, when I said that freedom is not free, I was not only speaking of the cost to those currently suffering in the world to throw off the yoke of tyranny, but also the price to us, the benefactors of past actions. \n",
      "   We are once again on the floor of the Senate to defend the National Endowment for Democracy. The last time we fought this battle, 2 years ago, 72 Senators voted to restore the funding to NED after the subcommittee zeroed the account. We are here today facing the same circumstances. The good news with the regularity of this debate, if we look for the bright side, is that we know very well of the strong support in the Senate for NED. And let me explain why. \n",
      "   The history is important. In 1983, Ronald Reagan outlined an initiative for the United States to publicly lead the struggle for freedom around the world. A policy which I remember well as a young House Member and in many ways continues to influence my thinking about American foreign policy. A fundamental pillar of that policy was the National Endowment for Democracy. \n",
      "   Let me read to you from a letter by President Reagan, from July 4, 1993.  \n",
      "   On this 217th anniversary of our nation's independence, I am reminded that America's greatness lies not only in our success at home, but in the example of leadership that we provide the entire world. \n",
      "   Our work, however, is not complete. As I look abroad, I see that the struggle between freedom and tyranny continues to be wages. Disappointly, in some places, it is autocracy, not freedom, that is winning the day. That is why I strongly support continued Congressional funding for the National Endowment for Democracy (NED). Ten years ago, at Westminster, you will recall that I outlined a new, bold initiative for our country to publicly lead the struggle for freedom abroad. As past of this effort, at my request, the National Endowment for Democracy was created.  \n",
      "   Mr. President, let me point out a few fundamental things. First, NED is not a ``cold war relic,'' as some critics argue. You will note that President Reagan did not say that the purpose was to defeat communism, to defeat the Soviet Union, or to contain any particular ideology. He said that the mission of NED was to support America's efforts to ``lead the struggle for freedom.'' You should also note that the letter from which I read is dated July 4, 1993--2 years after the fall of the Soviet Union. So let me be clear: NED is not about the cold war and has never been exclusively about fighting communism or the Soviet Union. The National Endowment for Democracy is about freedom. \n",
      "   My second point is that the need for NED is as great today as it has ever been. \n",
      "   We opposed communism because the flawed ideology oppresses people and empowers tyrants. Communism has almost disappeared as a threat today; but tyranny has not--oppression has not. Indeed, tyranny and oppression continue to rule in far too many places around the globe. If you accept that we were right in the past to oppose freedom's foes, then we have the same task today, perhaps even more complicated than in the past. \n",
      "   This vote, therefore, comes down to a simple issue: does the struggle for freedom continue in the world and does the United States continue to have a role in the struggle for freedom abroad? Does tyranny still reign in far too many places on earth? The answer is quite obviously, ``yes.'' \n",
      "   Let me address some critical questions others have raised. \n",
      "   Does NED work? NED works extremely well by providing resources to the freedom-activists throughout the world. NED identifies people struggling for economic, political, labor, press, and other reforms and gets them the resources necessary to fight against local oppression. \n",
      "   His Holiness the Dalai Lama of Tibet says the following about NED:  \n",
      "   The National Endowment for Democracy furthers the goals of your great nation and has provided moral and substantive support for oppressed peoples everywhere. Its unique independent mission has brought information and hope to people committed to peace and freedom, including the Tibetans. I sincerely hope that this institution will continue to receive support, because America's real strength comes not from its status as a `superpower' but from the ideals and principles on which it was founded.  \n",
      "   So the final question which someone may rightly put to this debate: why not the State Department? Isn't NED redundant? \n",
      "   To answer this question, I defer to some experts who understand the executive branch and State Department well. I turn to a bipartisan group of former Secretaries of State and National Security Advisors. \n",
      "   In a 1995 letter, former National Security Advisors Allen, Carlucci, Brzezinski, and Scowcroft state that NED:  \n",
      "   ..... operates in situations where direct government involvement is not appropriate. It is an exceptionally effective instrument in today's climate for reaching dedicated groups seeking to counter extreme nationalist and autocratic forces that are responsible for so much conflict and instability.  \n",
      "   Let me emphasize that these National Security Advisors state that NED is operating where the U.S. government cannot. \n",
      "   I also have a letter from former Secretaries of State, including Secretaries Baker, Muskie, Eagleburger, Shultz, Haig, Vance, and Kissinger. This distinguished group states the following:  \n",
      "   During this period of international change and uncertainty, the work of NED continues to be an important bipartisan but non-governmental contributor to democratic reform and freedom. We consider the non-governmental character of the NED even more relevant today than it was at NED's founding.  \n",
      "   Let me review the main arguments. First, NED's necessity did not end with the cold war, but remains an integral part of America's opposition to the enemies of freedom. Second, the world continues to need America's invaluable work in promoting freedom--perhaps even now more than ever. And finally, NED makes a unique contribution to America's initiative to ``lead the struggle for freedom abroad.'' \n",

But I would like to bring to the Chairman's attention an initiative undertaken by Florida's top three research universities: the University of Florida, Florida State University and the University of Miami. These three institutions came together to ensure their extensive capabilities in the areas of marine, atmosphere and climate prediction research were focused on the needs of the entire Southeast region. They have especially come together to study the El Nino phenomenon. Their effort has been recognized by NOAA and they have become one of the agency's first regional assessment centers. \n",
      "   My concern, Mr. President, is about the possibility that NOAA may reduce resources available to Florida and this valuable research initiative. Clearly, Florida and the Southeast region are significantly impacted by climatic developments. A strong and continued investment in Florida and the region--along with a balanced investment in the regional assessment centers--is essential. I would ask the support of the Committee to continue the base level funding of this important collaborative  effort. The institutions had been receiving approximately $500,000 per year through the Office of Global Programs, and I would like the Chairman's assurances that this level of funding should and will be continued during the next fiscal year. \n",

The administration asked for significant funding of the Everglades-Florida Bay initiative in both FY 99 and FY 2000 through the Coastal Ocean Science Program. But the concern I'm hearing from Florida indicates that NOAA may reallocate funds away from this initiative and toward other programs and purposes. I would like the Chairman to join me in stressing to the agency that funds in this bill currently allocated for critical Florida Bay initiatives not be depleted. I would like the Chairman to join me in working to ensure the NOAA contribution to the interagency program for Florida and adjacent coastal marine waters is continued at the current levels. \n",

      "   Mr. MACK. Mr. President today I am pleased to join my colleague, Mr. BREAUX, in sponsoring The Medicare Home Health Beneficiary Equity and Payment Simplification Act of 1999. \n",
      "   This legislation sets forth a fully developed prospective payment system for Medicare home health benefits that can be implemented easily using currently available data and can be accurately monitored to prevent fraud and abuse. Most importantly, the bill restores access to covered services for the sickest, most frail Medicare beneficiaries while providing incentives for efficient treatment of all patients regardless of the acuity of their medical condition. \n",
      "   The bill provides for a simple four-category prospective payment system for home health services (similar to the four-category system which has been in place for hospice services since 1983) which is based on data from a 1997 study conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation on characteristics of Medicare patients in need of covered home health services. The Kaiser Foundation study found that Medicare patients in need of home health services historically have fallen into one of the following categories: \n",
      "   1. Post-hospital, short stay beneficiaries \n",
      "   2. Medically stable, long-stay beneficiaries \n",
      "   3. Medically complex, long-stay beneficiaries \n",
      "   4. Medically unstable and complex, extremely high use beneficiaries \n",
      "   Beneficiaries who meet all eligibility and coverage requirements for Medicare will be assigned to the appropriate category by a physician who does not have a prohibited relationship with the home health agency as defined in the ``Stark II'' law. Beneficiaries who do not clearly fit in one of the four categories will be placed in the first, lowest rate category. \n",
      "   Payment rates for each of the categories is the average cost of treating patients in that category in 1994 as determined by the Kaiser Foundation study. Those rates are adjusted for wage variations in different parts of the country and updated by the home health market basket for each fiscal year. The Secretary of HHS is given the authority to provide additional payments to certain agencies that have higher costs due to reasons beyond their control. \n",
      "   The bill would eliminate the 15% cut in Medicare home health reimbursement which is scheduled to go into effect on October 1, 2000. The bill would also simplify the reimbursement system by making payments based on the location of the agency rather than the residence of the patient. The bill is inten ded to provide a ``fail safe'' prospective payment mechanism in the event that HCFA falls behind in its schedule to implement a prospective payment system by October 1, 2000 that can be administered efficiently and monitored effectively. \n",

      "   Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senator FRIST, Senator JEFFORDS, and Senator COLLINS, and others, as we offer this amendment to provide cancer patients with coverage of health insurance benefits when they participate in approved clinical trials. \n",
      "   Many health plans will not pay for the cost of routine patient care if patients want to participate in a clinical trial. As a result, beneficiaries with cancer are denied access to these trials of promising new therapies because these therapies are deemed ``experimental'' by most health plans and, therefore, not qualified for coverage. This means many cancer patients have two choices when they have exhausted all traditional therapies: either pay the cost of participating in a clinical trial themselves or go without additional treatment. \n",
      "   For all but the most wealthy patients, it is cost prohibitive to take part in a clinical trial. This amendment will help ensure that a patient's decision about whether or not to participate in a clinical trial is based upon science and not cost. \n",
      "   Clinical trials are one of the most effective ways of determining which treatments are beneficial. Yet cancer researchers have told me they have had difficulty enrolling the required number of patients to participate in the clinical trials they are conducting. Scientists have identified noncoverage by private insurers, as well as Medicare, as one of the primary reasons why patients do not participate in clinical trials. \n",
      "   For example, approximately 2 percent of cancer patients are participating in clinical trials. This amendment will help scientists recruit cancer patients who wish to participate in clinical trials by breaking down the financial barriers which may preclude most patients from participating. \n",
      "   Clinical trials are one of the most effective techniques for assessing the effectiveness of a scientific and medical intervention. Many of my Senate colleagues have joined with me in a bipartisan effort to double biomedical research funding through the National Institutes of Health. Last year, Congress appropriated $15.6 billion for NIH. This represented a $2 billion increase, the largest increase in NIH history. At a time when American researchers are making such tremendous progress in scientific areas such as cancer genetics and biology, it is essential that this knowledge be translated into new therapies through well-designed clinical trials. This amendment is a natural extension of the historic effort to double funding for medical research in our country. \n",
      "   When my brother, Michael, was diagnosed with cancer, there were only three basic forms of treatment--surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Today, scientists are revolutionizing the treatment of cancer by developing many new weapons to kill cancer, including gene therapy and immunotherapy. \n",
      "   On a personal note again, every time I get into these discussions, and every time I see the new efforts that are being pursued, and the successes that have been developed, I cannot help but think if Michael's melanoma had been discovered or if he had found the disease much later in his life, when these new procedures--gene therapy and immunotherapy were available--and if he had been able to participate in a clinical trial, which he attempted to do throughout his treatment many years ago, his life may have been saved. \n",
      "   This amendment will help scientists continue the unprecedented progress being made to find new methods of treatment. \n",
      "   Coverage of cancer clinical trials is a bipartisan issue. Earlier this year, for example, Senator ROCKEFELLER and I introduced legislation to provide for Medicare coverage of cancer clinical trials. I am pleased to say that 36 additional Senators, from both sides of the aisle, have cosponsored this legislation. I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this important legislation during the 106th Congress. \n",
      "   The reason Senator ROCKEFELLER and I targeted our legislation to cancer is the same reason we have targeted this amendment to cancer today--there is a legitimate debate about what the true cost may be. Senator ROCKEFELLER and I believe the cost will be insignificant. And we have the studies to prove that. \n",
      "   However, there are legitimate concerns with respect to cost which have been raised. Both the amendment we offer today and the Rockefeller-Mack legislation, call for a study and report to Congress in 2005 on the cost implications of covering cancer clinical trials. \n",
      "   I support comprehensive coverage of clinical trials. But, at this time, we need more information before we go further. This amendment will help provide the information we need to make a better informed decision. \n",
      "   During markup of S. 326, the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions considered an amendment offered by my friend and colleague, Senator DODD, to provide clinical trial coverage. \n",
      "   Since then, my colleagues and I have more thoroughly studied this amendment. We have examined what barriers exist that impede enrollment in clinical trials. We looked into the cost implications. We considered the best way to define the term ``routine patient costs.'' \n",
      "   Let me first highlight the many similarities in our amendment and the amendment which Senator DODD offered during committee consideration. \n",
      "   Our amendment requires plans to provide coverage of routine patient costs. I will get back to that term in a few minutes. \n",
      "   Our amendments ensures that health plans are not required to pay for costs of items and services that are reasonably expected to be paid for by the sponsors of a clinical trial. This includes tests or measurements conducted primarily for the purpose of a clinical trial. \n",
      "   Our amendment permits plans to require clinical trial participants to use in-network providers, if they are available. If coverage is provided by a nonparticipating provider, payment would be at the same rate the plan would pay for comparable services to a participating provider. \n",
      "   Our amendment is limited to those health plans over which Congress has sole and exclusive jurisdiction. \n",
      "   Our amendment is limited to only the highest-quality clinical trials. These include trials approved and funded by the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Veterans Affairs,  and the Department of Defense. Only those trials which have undergone the rigors of peer-review will be considered. \n",
      "   Our legislation differs with Senator DODD's proposal in three ways. \n",
      "   The first difference is how to best define the term ``routine patient cost.'' In researching this issue, we have found that there is not a generally accepted definition of the term, ``routine patient cost'' associated with participation in a clinical trial. The Balanced Budget Act required the Institute of Medicine to conduct a study on the issue of cancer clinical trial coverage, including the definition of routine patient costs. This study is due in September, and it will likely help us to better define this highly technical term. There are other experts who have opinions on how to define the term ``routine patient cost.'' We believe it is best to leave this task to patients, employers, health plans and those with true expertise in the field of clinical trials. \n",
      "   It is essential to remember that protocols for clinical trials vary widely, and routine patient costs for clinical trials also vary. Scientific researchers have indicated that developing one standard for determining routine patient costs will be a daunting task. I don't believe Congress is best qualified to make this important scientific determination. \n",
      "   Therefore, our amendment provides for a negotiated rulemaking process to establish a time-limited committee charged with developing standards relating to the coverage of routine patient costs for patients participating in clinical trials. This way, organizations representing cancer patients, health care practitioners, hospitals, employers, manufacturers of drugs and medical devices, medical economists and others will be involved in the process of defining routine patient costs with respect to clinical trials. \n",
      "   By May, this committee is required to develop standards for routine patient costs for individuals who are participating in those trials. If the committee is unable to reach a consensus, then the Secretary must develop these standards and publish a rule by June 30, in the year 2000. In either case, coverage for these benefits would begin for plans beginning on, or after, January 1, 2001. \n",
      "   We believe that a negotiated rulemaking process is the best way for organizations representing all who are affected to collectively determine what costs should be considered in ``routine patient costs.'' These decisions will have a major effect of the cost of covering clinical trials. \n",
      "   I will just underscore that again. These decisions will have a major effect on the cost of covering clinical trials. \n",
      "   Under the Democratic bill, these organizations can only submit a comment to the Secretary, who has broad authority to determine what constitutes routine patient costs. However, those comments could be rejected out-of-hand by the Secretary. \n",
      "   By contrast, the negotiated rulemaking process ensures that all who have an interest in the outcome have a seat at the negotiating table to make the decision. We believe it is essential that cancer patients have an opportunity to be involved in establishing standards for routine patient costs, and a negotiated rulemaking procedure affords them that opportunity. \n",
      "   Second, as I mentioned earlier, our amendment differs from the Dodd amendment in that it is limited to cancer clinical trials. There are more clinical trials involving cancer than perhaps any other disease. This targeted approach will not only provide a needed benefit to a large patient population, but it will also provide significant information for the study and report called for in this amendment. \n",
      "   Finally, our amendment includes a study and report to Congress on the costs to health plans and any impact on health insurance premiums. Senator DODD's amendment did not include this study and report, which I believe is extremely important. Congress can then use this important information to determine if they wish to expand coverage for patients with other diseases. \n",
      "   Like most of my colleagues, I am very concerned about the ever-increasing costs of health insurance. According to the Congressional Budget Office, our amendment will result in an increase in health insurance premiums of less than one-tenth of one percent. The Dodd proposal would cost five times that amount. \n",
      "   I have met with thousands of cancer patients throughout Florida and the rest of the United States, patients desperately wanting to participate in clinical trials when traditional therapies are no longer beneficial. \n",
      "   Let me conclude my comments here today by relating an experience which puts a human face on why this issue is so important. \n",
      "   As my colleagues may know, I frequently visit the National Institutes of Health to meet with scientific reserchers so I may gain a better understanding of the many advances which are taking place to detect and treat cancer and other diseases. \n",
      "   Over the years, I have been fortunate to get to know Dr. Steven Rosenberg, a world-renowned scientist and oncologist who is an expert in the field of melanoma research and treatment. I first met Dr. Rosenberg after reading his book, ``The Transformed Cell.'' \n",

      "\n",
      "106-mack-fl-4-19990715\n",
      "\n",
      "   Mr. MACK. Last year, I was meeting with Dr. Rosenberg to learn about a clinical trial he is conducting on a state-of-the art melanoma vaccine. During our conversation, Dr. Rosenberg mentioned that one of my constituents was at NCI participating in that clinical trial. I asked if I might meet him. Before we went to his hospital room at NCI, Dr. Rosenberg showed me photographs which had previously been taken. This patient had purple, bulbous melanoma lesions several inches in diameter down the side of his body. \n",
      "   Dr. Rosenberg introduced me to my constituent, and we engaged in casual conversation. \n",
      "   At one point I asked him how he was doing. To show me how he was doing, this brave man took off his hospital gown and showed me that these lesions of huge size on both his arm and his side were totally gone. That is why I think it is so important that we have this amendment included in the legislation, so that other cancer patients will have the same opportunity. \n",
      "   To conclude, what is this amendment really about? Most importantly, it is about giving patients fighting cancer the hope that an experimental therapy being tested in a well-designed clinical trial might save their lives. In addition to providing hope, it paves the way for new therapies that will, one day, not only provide hope, but a cure. It is about allowing cancer patients to make what may be the final major health care decision of their lives--whether to participate in a clinical trial. \n",
      "   Mr. President, I've met with many patients who were participating in clinical trials. To me, these patients are, in many ways, like America's astronauts. Later this month, we will celebrate the 30th anniversary of man's landing on the Moon. Like the astronauts of Apollo, clinical trial participants are pioneers. They are heroes, who are helping to push science and medicine into new frontiers. We must provide hope to these brave Americans. \n",

      "   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I am not sure I need 5 minutes. I could not help but listen very closely to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle with respect to the issue of clinical trials and the idea of targeting clinical trials to cancer. \n",
      "   One could draw the conclusion from what they had to say either they never heard of the idea of targeting clinical trials to cancer or there was some confusion. I remind my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who have supported a clinical trial expansion of the Medicare program that is limited to only cancer --let me say that again. The clinical trial legislation that Senator ROCKEFELLER and I introduced earlier this year is limited to cancer only; just as this amendment is limited to cancer: Senator FEINSTEIN, Senator SARBANES, Senator JOHNSON, Senator  BINGAMAN, Senator KERRY, Senator LEAHY, Senator KERREY, Senator SCHUMER, Senator AKAKA, Senator MURRAY, Senator BREAUX, Senator MIKULSKI, Senator CONRAD, Senator WELLSTONE, Senator MOYNIHAN, Senator INOUYE, Senator GRAHAM, Senator HARKIN, Senator KENNEDY, Senator BOXER, Senator DURBIN, Senator ROBB, Senator BIDEN, Senator DODD, and Senator HOLLINGS. \n",
      "   I submit that one of the reasons we have this not only in this amendment but also in the Medicare approach is because there is truly a concern about what the true cost of clinical trials is. As I said in my earlier comment, Senator ROCKEFELLER and I happen to believe the cost is quite small. In fact, there are arguments out there that Medicare is already picking up the cost of those clinical trials. We have limited it to cancer because we, in fact, believe we can develop information that will allow us to expand it. \n",

      "   Mr. MACK. If the Senator would wait. What I have found, as I have listened to this debate now for 4 days, is the term ``compartmentalization'' comes back into my mind: The ability on the other side of the aisle to think of one procedure, one amendment, one concept at a time, as if it has no influence or no effect on the cost of health care and what it might do to those individuals who could lose their health care coverage because of increased costs. It is very reasonable to ask the question: What does it cost; how do you define certain aspects of the clinical trial that is going to take place? \n",
      "   I will be glad to yield. \n",

      "   Mr. MACK. First of all, the impression created that HMOs or most HMOs cover all clinical trials is inaccurate. \n",
      "   There is a second component to this thing. ERISA plans versus the plans that we have control over may be confusing the issue as well. \n",
      "   In addition, though, I think it is important to focus. Again, this discussion has come down to a discussion about cost. I happen to agree with the Senator from Connecticut about the data that we have from those two health organizations. But I think he knows as  well that there are those out there who make claims that the cost of the clinical trials would be substantially higher than that--from OMB, CBO, the administration. \n",
      "   So the point is that there is a legitimate debate about the cost of clinical trials. I am saying I think, before we go to the full extent of comprehensive coverage, we ought to fully understand what we are getting ourselves involved in. \n",

      "   Mr. President, I want to respond to one provision of the amendment offered last night by my friend from Connecticut, Senator DODD. This provision goes to a concern that has been raised by patients throughout our country--the issue of health coverage for patients who are participating in clinical trials. \n",
      "   As Members of the United States Senate, we must seek legislative solutions to a wide array of public policy issues. These issues include health policy, as we are doing today. They include tax policy, economic policy, foreign policy, and education policy. The list is quite expansive. Frequently, we find ourselves divided on issues of the day. \n",
      "   However, I can think of no issue which better unites Republicans and Democrats, conservatives and liberals, as the issue of biomedical research. \n",
      "   In addition to Senator DODD, we are fortunate to have many, many leaders in the Senate on this important issue. Senator SPECTER and Senator HARKIN are leading the historic bipartisan effort to double funding for the National Institutes of Health. Senator JEFFORDS, Senator FIRST, Senator KENNEDY, and Senator MIKULSKI have worked hard in their committee to authorize and oversee the activities of the HIH. Any many more of my colleagues have each contributed in their own way to help make funding for HIH the national priority it is today. As I said, few issues unite the Senate like medical research. \n",
      "   One of the highlights during my 17 years as a Member of the Senate and House of Representatives has been to meet the scientists who are revolutionizing the way man fights disease, and to improve our quality of life. It doesn't matter if they are a young bench scientist or a Nobel Laureate, their mission remains the same--to find ways to detect and treat diseases. Today, there is a level of commitment and enthusiasm to this monumental endeavor that I've never seen before. Today, researchers dare to use the word, ``cure.'' That wasn't the case very long ago. \n",
      "   As we work to make sure that scientists have the necessary resources to continue their remarkable progress, we must also address the ethical, legal and social implications of biomedical research. Science is moving faster than public policy can keep pace. It's as though science is on the Concorde, and Congress stalled at Kitty Hawk trying to get off the ground. \n",
      "   There are very difficult, complex scientific issues which require Congressional action, but these issues also require thoughtful and careful deliberation. For example, Congress has been working for many years to ensure that health plans do not discriminate against people because of their genetic information. As a cancer survivor, I know how important it is to have confidence in knowing that a genetic test will be used for information, not discrimination. I've been part of a bipartisan effort to resolve this issue, starting with legislation introduced by our former colleague, Senator Mark Hatfield. \n",
      "   Genetic nondiscrimination is a very complex issue with wide-ranging ramifications. There have been many questions to answer. Congress has struggled with how best to define medical and scientific terms. We have examined the impact of our actions on the cost and availability of health insurance. Frequently, we have determined that much more information was needed before deciding the best approach. \n",
      "   We have addressed the issue of genetic nondiscrimination with thoughtful deliberation, and I believe the Congress must take the same thoughtful, deliberative approach when it comes to coverage of clinical trials. \n",
      "   There are many questions to be answered. What are the cost implications? How will this new benefit impact the availability of health insurance? What impact will coverage of clinical trials have on health insurance premiums? How will it impact small business owners, who are struggling to provide health insurance for their employees? What is the best approach to defining medical and scientific terms, such as ``routine patient costs''?--becasue that definition will determine what the underlying costs of this effort will be. \n",
      "   These are very important questions, involving very complex issues, with very significant implications. \n",
      "   Mr. President, I support comprehensive coverage of clinical trials. But, as this time, we need more information before we go that far. \n",
      "   Later today, or tomorrow, I will be introducing an amendment, along with Senator FRIST, Senator JEFFORDS, Senator COLLINS, and others, which will help provide patients, scientists, lawmakers, employers, health plans and others with answers to the many questions associated with health insurance coverage for clinical trials. I will outline our approach at that time. \n",
      "   Mr. President, medical research is a bipartisan issue. We all agree that the basic scientific research funded by the National Institutes of Health must be translated into new forms of treatment through well-designed clinical trials. Earlier this year, Senator ROCKFELLER and I introduced legislation to provide Medicare coverage for cancer clinical trials. I am pleased to say that a bipartisan group of 36 Senators have cosponsored this bill. Senator SNOWE and others have introduced legislation to provide coverage through private health plans. We may approach the issue in different ways, but we all agree that the Senate must address the issue of clinical trial coverage, and we must do so now.  \n",

      "   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, proponents of the quota legislation to be considered later today have spoken with vigor and passion regarding the ``injury'' that was suffered by domestic steel companies and the threat imports pose to the workers at those companies.  \n",
      "   However, I am compelled to rise today to respond to many of the assertions raised regarding the steel industry specifically, and more generally I think it is important to speak to several other factors related to the bill. First, there are economic benefits all Americans enjoy as a result of lowering trade barriers; second, the harmful message a quota bill would send to our trading partners; and, third, the inappropriateness of Congress singling out a specific industry for special treatment. \n",
      "   The first point I would like to make is that the import surge is over. According to the Department of Commerce, imports have returned to their traditional levels. In fact, overall steel imports in the first 4 months of 1999 were below the ``pre-import'' surge level. Moreover, even with the import surge of 1998, U.S. steel producers reported profits of over $1 billion. \n",
      "   Furthermore, in reviewing data provided by the Steel Manufacturers Association, I was surprised to find that U.S. steel production has increased over the last 10 years. The 1998 steel output of 107.6 million tons was 10 percent greater than 1990 and the highest for any year since 1981. \n",
      "   Additionally, I was interested to discover that since 1987, imports as a percentage of domestic consumption have remained constant at around 20 percent. Again, according to this data, no ground has been lost despite protestations to the contrary. \n",
      "   Some have argued that the financial ill health of several specific companies such as Bethlehem Steel Corporation, Weirton Steel Corporation, Laclede Steel Company, Acme Metals Incorporated, and Geneva Steel Company are the direct result of last year's import surge. However, the fact is that many of the integrated steel mills have a history of declining financial health evident well in advance of the Asian crisis and the 1998 import surge. This is reflected in their stock performance which, without exception, shows a pronounced decline in the value of the stock over the last 5 years. Again, it has nothing to do with the surge in imports. \n",
      "   Noting the declining employment figures in the steel industry, proponents of the quota bill suggest that the United States is losing market share, but the fact is imports have not led to a decrease in market share. U.S. steel production in traditional integrated mills has remained fairly flat. Import competition has merely forced U.S. steel to become more efficient. The growth in domestic production that has allowed U.S. steel to retain its domestic share has been almost exclusively a result of our Nation's mini-mills which now account for almost 50 percent of domestic steel production. Mini-mills use an innovative production technique to recycle scrapped steel. These highly efficient and environmentally friendly producers are transforming the steel industry, and I think here it is worth noting that the association of mini-mills is neutral with regard to the proposed quota legislation. \n",
      "   Finally in this area, some argue our foreign competitors are playing by a different set of rules. \n",
      "   This is exactly what our current antidumping laws are intended to address. The steel industry has shown itself to be intimately familiar with and more than willing to take advantage of these laws. Even though steel accounts for only 5 percent of our imports, the industry has generated 46 percent of the unfair-trade complaints brought before the U.S. International Trade Commission during the last 2 decades. Our current laws provide appropriate protection for all industries. They should not be circumvented in order to provide extraordinary protection for a single industry. \n",
      "   All too often we hear complaints of lost jobs and invariably the blame is laid on trade. This allegation has gone unanswered for far too long. Trade has given us far more jobs than would otherwise be available. The fact is that the size of the trade sector has grown steadily during the last 50 years. As a share of the economy, trade doubled between 1950 and 1980, and it has doubled again between 1980 and 1998. Not surprisingly, employment has expanded from 99 million in 1980 to 133 million today. And, the unemployment rate has fallen to 4.2 percent, the lowest level in 30 years. \n",
      "   Far from harming our economy, trade has been a major contributing factor to our growth and our prosperity. Real GDP is now 64 percent greater than it was in 1980 and we have experienced only 9 months of recession during the last 16 years. Moreover, our growth rate is now the highest and our unemployment rate the lowest among the G-7 nations. \n",
      "   Trade makes it possible for us to focus on the production of the things we do best, and thereby produce a larger output and enjoy a higher standard of living. For goods and services that we produce cheaply, we can expand our output and sell abroad at attractive prices. And for things we do poorly, we can acquire them more economically from foreign producers. Thus, trade promotes prosperity. \n",
      "   We have fought for open markets both through GATT and now the WTO. And we have been engaged in this fight, this battle for almost 50 years. For some time, we have told the world that economic freedom and a market economy are key ingredients of prosperity. The steel quota bill undermines this message. \n",
      "   Let me make four points with respect to the message. \n",
      "   A quota bill would send the wrong message to the European Union. A quota bill would send the wrong message to the former Communist countries seeking to establish market economies. A quota bill would send the wrong message to investors. And a quota bill would send the wrong message to our trading partners. \n",
      "   Let me just touch lightly on each of those. \n",
      "   With respect to the European Union, \n",
      "   we are currently in the midst of a trade dispute with the EU regarding their restrictions on both bananas and beef. The steel quota bill undercuts our position on these issues. How can we complain about the restrictions of others while we ourselves are erecting trade barriers? \n",
      "   With respect to the leaders of the former communist countries, this bill says when we think it is convenient, it is all right to substitute political manipulation for markets. I can assure you, the leaders of the former communist countries are watching. If a prosperous America with a low unemployment rate is willing to bail out troubled firms, how can we expect them to refrain from such action. \n",
      "   With respect to investors, while much of the world has been in recession, investment flowed into the United States and the U.S. economy remained strong. In no small degree, this confidence of investors was due to the openness of our economy and our reliance on markets rather than politics. \n",
      "   Again, with respect to our trading partners, our trading partners--most of which have lower and slower rates of growth and higher unemployment--are unlikely to stand idly by while we impose trade barriers. Retaliation and escalation of trade barriers are likely side-effects. \n",
      "   Finally, it bears mentioning that it is a serious mistake for Congress to play favorites. This is precisely what is involved here. \n",
      "   This bill imposes a tax on steel-users in order to subsidize steel-producers. A substantial share of the U.S. steel industry refines raw steel into finished and specialty goods. The U.S. steel industry is therefore a major purchaser of imported steel. Higher steel prices which will surely accompany import quotas will increase the cost of refined steel and make these products less competitive than would otherwise be the case. \n",
      "   Moreover, this bill would treat the steel industry different than other industries. Steel is not the only industry that has been adversely affected by currency devaluations and weak demand due to the Asian crisis and recession in several parts of the world. The sales of many firms were affected as the result of these factors. Why should this industry be singled out for special treatment? \n",
      "   In conclusion, I want to stress that the legislation we will be considering later today proposes that the Congress intervene in the market, risk a trade war, and endanger the future health of our economy in order to insulate a segment of out steel industry from competition. I maintain there is already sufficient legislation on the books to protect industries against unfair competitive practices. Quotas and trade barriers are the wrong path. The world has already gone down this ``trade  war'' road once before with the Smoot-Hawley Law of 1930. Let's not make that same mistake again. \n",
      "   Additionally, I should note that Chairman Greenspan recently has sounded the dangers of protectionism. He now believes that rising protectionism is the single most dangerous threat to our future growth and prosperity. I share his concern. \n",
      "   Make no mistake about it--important principles are at stake here. We should be reducing trade barriers rather than increasing them. We have no business playing favorites. As our recent High-Tech Summit indicated, trade in both goods and ideas has made an enormous contribution to our prosperity. We must not allow this misguided effort to assist some at the expense of others and endanger American prosperity. \n",

      "   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of the Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999. This bill was introduced by Senator JEFFORDS and co-sponsored by 77 members. The primary purpose of this legislation is to expand the availability of health care coverage under the Social Security Act for working individuals with disabilities. This bill establishes a Ticket to Work and Self-Sufficiency Program in the Social Security Administration to make available meaningful work opportunities for the disabled. \n",
      "   Some months ago, in Florida, I met a woman who does not have the use of her arms. This woman is an accomplished artist who uses her feet to create beautiful works of art. She spoke with me about the difficulty she has had over the years obtaining health insurance for routine medical care and asked me to support this bill. It is with her in mind and the many other talented, hard-working disabled Americans that I support this act which will make it possible for them to obtain health coverage and lead productive working lives. \n",
      "   This bill allows states to offer Medicaid coverage to workers with disabilities beyond what is currently available to them under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. It creates two new optional eligibility categories and allows states to offer buy-ins for the working disabled so that they can maintain health care coverage, work, and have as much independence as their disability allows. One option permits states to offer a Medicaid buy-in to people with disabilities who work and have an earned income above 250% of poverty with specified levels for assets, resources and unearned income set by the state in which they reside. This is important to many of the disabled who have income or assets that exceed the current level and have an earned income that has exceeded $500 per month during the past year. The state can and should impose a sliding scale of cost-sharing of the premium, up to 100% of the premium, based on the income of the individual. This will allow many of the disabled who simply cannot get health insurance because they have income or assets above a certain level, to obtain health coverage. With the passage of this legislation, a person with disabilities who may be an artist, computer programmer or run a telephone answering service can now be successful at work and have no fear of being unable to obtain health coverage. \n",
      "   The second option allows states that elect to participate in the first option to also cover people who have a severe impairment but can lose eligibility for Supplemental Security Income or Social Security Disability Insurance because of medical improvement. In certain cases, the only reason a person improves is because they receive medical treatment. This bill prevents a person from losing their health care coverage when their health improves due to medical treatment. The state can allow this type of person to buy into the state Medicaid program at a premium set by the state. This is a blessing to persons with disabling conditions which are amenable to treatment such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, depression, or sickle cell anemia. It allows people who can work to work and receive treatment for what may be a chronic disease and have no fear of losing their health coverage. \n",
      "   An additional benefit of this bill provides for the continuation of Medicare coverage for working individuals with disabilities. An extended period of eligibility will allow people who receive Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) to continue to receive Part A Medicare coverage without payment for up to six years after returning to work. At present, disabled people may receive Medicare coverage for nine months followed by 36 months of extended eligibility but after that, they have to pay the Part A premium in full. Often, people returning to work following a period of coverage by SSDI, work part time so they are ineligible for health insurance or they cannot obtain insurance through their employer or from the private market. This bill would permit them to receive Part A coverage and have coverage they could not otherwise obtain. \n",
      "   I join with my colleagues in support of this legislation to help the disabled help themselves. \n",

      "   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to remedy a problem in the way the U.S. taxes the foreign operations of U.S. electric and gas utilities. With the 1992 passage of the National Energy Policy Act, Congress gave a green light to U.S. utilities wishing to do business abroad, lifting a long-standing prohibition. U.S. utilities were allowed to compete for the foreign business opportunities created by the privatization of national utilities and the need for the construction of facilities to meet increased energy demands abroad. \n",
      "   Since 1992, U.S. utility companies have made significant investments in utility operations in the United Kingdom, Australia, Eastern Europe, the Far East and South America. These investments in foreign utilities have created domestic jobs in the fields of design, architecture, engineering, construction, and heavy equipment manufacturing. They also allow U.S. utilities an opportunity to diversify and grow. \n",
      "   Unfortunately, the Internal Revenue Code penalizes these investments by subjecting them to double-taxation. U.S. companies with foreign operations receive tax credits for a portion of the taxes they pay to foreign countries, to reduce the double-taxation that would otherwise result from the U.S. policy of taxing worldwide income. The size of these foreign tax credits are affected by a number of factors, as U.S. tax laws recalculate the amount of foreign income that is recognized for tax credit purposes. \n",
      "   Section 864 of the tax code allocates deductible interest expenses between the U.S. and foreign operations based on the relative book values of assets located in the U.S. and abroad. By ignoring business realities and the peculiar circumstances of U.S. utilities, this allocation rule overtaxes them. Because U.S. utilities were until recently prevented from operating abroad, their foreign plants and equipment have been recently-acquired and consequently have not been much depreciated, in contrast to their domestic assets which are in most cases fully-depreciated. Thus, a disproportionate amount of interest expenses are allocated to foreign income, reducing the foreign income base that is recognized for U.S. tax purposes thus the size of the corresponding foreign tax credits. \n",
      "   The allocation rules increase the double-taxation of foreign income by reducing foreign tax credits, thereby increasing domestic taxation. The unfairness of this result is magnified by the fact that the interest expenses--which are the reason the foreign tax credit shrinks--are usually associated with domestically-regulated debt, which is tied to domestic production and is not as fungible as the tax code assumes. \n",
      "   The result of this economically-irrational taxation scheme is a very high effective tax rate on certain foreign investment and a loss of U.S. foreign tax credits. Rather than face this double-tax penalty, some U.S. utilities have actually chosen not to invest overseas and others have pulled back from their initial investments. \n",
      "   One solution to this problem is found in the legislation that I am introducing today. This remedy is to exempt from the interest allocation rules of Section 864 the debt associated with a U.S. utility's furnishing and sale of electricity or natural gas in the United States. This proposed rule is similar to the rule governing ``non-recourse'' debt, which is not subjected to foreign allocation. In both cases, lenders look to specific cash flows for repayment and specific assets as collateral. These loans are thus distinguishable from the typical risks of general credit lending transactions. \n",
      "   The specific cash flow aspect of non-recourse financing is a critical element of the non-recourse debt exception, and logic requires that the same tax treatment should be given to analogous utility debt. Thus, my bill would exempt from allocation to foreign source income the interest on debt incurred in the trade or business of furnishing or selling electricity or natural gas in the United States. The current situation is a very real problem that must be remedied, and I urge my colleagues to support the solution I am proposing. \n",

      "   The 3 Data System is a laser radar system that provides high fidelity time, space, positioning information (TSPI) on test articles during flight. The instrumentation can be applied to air, ground, and sea targets. Additionally, it will provide the potential capability for over-the-horizon tracking from an airborne platform or pedestal mounted ground platform. It includes a multi-object tracking capability that will allow simultaneous tracking of up to 20 targets throughout their profile. The system will enable testing of advanced smart weapon systems; force-on-force exercises where multiple aircraft and ground vehicle tracking is involved; over water scoring of large footprint autonomous guided and unguided munitions; and enable an improvement to existing aging radar presently in service. It is mobile and can support testing at other major ranges and locations in support of other Service's requirements. \n",

The Air Force has informed me that precision engagement is one of the emerging operational concepts in Joint Vision 2010. The 3-Data system would provide a capability to effectively evaluate the performance of advanced precision guided munitions and smart weapons prior to their use in a wartime environment. It would also directly support ongoing activities abroad through Quick Reaction Tasking that may require a multiple object tracking device to evaluate engagement profiles. This requirement is documented through 46th Test Wing strategic planning initiatives, developmental program test plans, and munitions strategic planning roadmaps.  \n",
      "   The Air Force is presently attempting to meet this requirement through existing radar systems and optical tracking systems which cannot track multiple objects to the fidelity levels required and which require extensive post-mission data reduction times.

      "   Other nations have systems of taxation which rely less on corporate income taxes and more on value-added taxes. By rebating the value-added taxes for products that are exported, these nations lower the costs of their exports and provide their companies a competitive advantage that is not based on quality, ingenuity, or resources but rather on tax policy. \n",
      "   In an attempt to level the playing field, our tax code allows U.S. companies to establish Foreign Sales Corporations (FSCs) through which U.S.-manufactured products may be exported. A portion of the profits from FSC sales are exempted from corporate income taxes, to mitigate the advantage that other countries give their exporters through value-added tax rebates. \n",
      "   But the tax benefits of a FSC are cut in half for defense exporters. This 50% limitation is the result of a compromise enacted 23 years ago as part of  the predecessor to the FSC provisions. This compromise was not based on policy considerations, but instead merely split the difference between members who believed that the U.S. defense industry was so dominant in world markets that the foreign tax advantages were inconsequential, and members who believed that all U.S. exporters should be treated equally. \n",
      "   Today, U.S. defense manufacturers face intense competition from foreign businesses. With the sharp decline in the defense budget over the past decade, exports of defense products play a prominent role in maintaining a viable U.S. defense industrial base. It makes no sense to allow differences in international tax systems to stand as an obstacle to exports of U.S. defense products. We must level the international playing field for U.S. defense product manufacturers. \n",
      "   The fifty percent exclusion for sales of defense products makes even less sense when one considers that the sale of every defense product to a foreign government requires the determination of both the President and the Congress that the sale will strengthen the security of the United States and promote world peace. This is more than a matter of fair treatment for all U.S. exporters. National security is enhanced when our allies use U.S.-manufactured military equipment, because of its compatibility with equipment used by our armed forces. \n",
      "   The Department of Defense supports repeal of this provision. In an August 26, 1998 letter, Deputy Secretary of Defense John Hamre wrote Treasury Secretary Rubin about the FSC. Hamre wrote, ``The Department of Defense (DoD) supports extending the full benefits of the FSC exemption to defense exporters.*.*.*.[P]utting defense and non-defense companies on the same footing would encourage defense exports that would promote standardization and interoperability of equipment among our allies. It also could result in a decrease in the cost of defense products to the Department of Defense.'' \n",

It repeals the provision of the Foreign Sales Corporation laws that discriminates against U.S. defense product manufacturers, enhancing both the competitiveness of U.S. companies in world markets and our national security. \n",

      "   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today Senator GRAHAM and I introduce legislation that would help protect Florida from economic devastation in the event of a catastrophic windstorm or other peril. \n",
      "   Our legislation would amend Section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code to grant tax-exempt status to the Florida Windstorm Underwriting Association (FWUA), the Florida Residential Property and Casualty Joint Underwriting Association (JUA) and similar state-chartered, not-for-profit insurers serving markets in which commercial insurance is not available. The FWUA and JUA are non-profit entities established by the state to provide property and casualty insurance coverage in those markets not adequately served by other insurers. \n",
      "   In most years, Florida is not hit by a major hurricane or natural catastrophe. In those years, the FWUA and JUA take in more premiums than are paid out in claims or expenses. Since these entities are not-for-profit, state law prevents those funds from being distributed--they are instead literally saved for a severely rainy or windy day. Nonetheless, the Internal Revenue Code requires 35% of those funds to be sent to Washington as federal income taxes rather than used to fund reserves. Designating the FWUA and JUA as tax-exempt will help Florida to accumulate the necessary reserves to pay claims brought on by a catastrophe. This bill gives the two Florida catastrophe funds the same tax-exempt status that is already enjoyed by a number of not-for-profit insurance provers. \n",
      "   State law authorizes the FWUA and the JUA to assess property insurance policyholders throughout Florida to pay for losses generated by catastrophic storms or other perils. Thus, the benefits of the tax exemption would reduce the frequency and severity of assessments levied against individual policyholders. Greater funds would be available to cover losses which otherwise would be paid for by higher assessments on Florida policyholders--cutting taxes for the approximately 5,000,000 property owners in the state of Florida. \n",
      "   This legislation has the bipartisan support of the entire Florida Congressional delegation in addition to strong backing from Governor Jeb Bush, the State Insurance Commissioner, the Florida Senate President and Florida's House Speaker. And this change in the tax code would result in only a negligible loss of federal tax revenue, according to Joint Tax. \n",

      "   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, two years ago in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, we included a provision to correct an unfair and unsound tax policy of the Clinton Administration concerning business meal deductions. The 1993 Clinton tax increases included a reduction in the percentage of business meal expenses that could be deducted, from 80 percent down to 50 percent. The Administration marketed this as an attack on the ``three martini lunch,'' but the tax increase was in fact a big blow to the wallets and pocketbooks of working class Americans whose jobs require them to be stranded far from home. \n",
      "   Workers who are covered by federal ``hours of service'' regulations--long-haul truckers, airline flight attendants and pilots, long distance bus drivers, some merchant mariners and railroad workers--have no choice but to eat their meals on the road. Their meal expenses are a necessary and unavoidable part of their jobs. The Clinton Administration's business meal tax increase hit these occupations hard. For the average trucker, making between $32,000 and $36,000 annually, this tax increase might be greater than $1,000 per year. This is a lot of money to these hard-working taxpayers. \n",
      "   Congress addressed this inequity in 1997, passing a provision that would gradually raise the meal deduction percentage back to 80 percent for these workers. But a slow, gradual fix is not good enough. Today, Senator KOHL, Senator GRASSLEY, and I are introducing a bill that would immediately restore the 80 percent deduction for truckers, flight crews, and other workers limited by the federal ``hours of service'' regulations. \n",

      "   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today Senator BOB GRAHAM and I, along with 17 of our colleagues, are introducing legislation to modernize the tax rules that apply to real estate investment trusts (``REITs''). \n",
      "   This legislation is designed to remove barriers in the tax laws that impose unnecessary administrative burdens and make it more difficult for REITs to compete in an evolving marketplace. Our bill is similar to a proposal included in the President's Fiscal Year 2000 budget that permits REITs to establish a new type of subsidiary called a ``taxable REIT subsidiary'' (``TRS''). As with the President's proposal, the legislation we introduce today would permit REITs to establish a TRS to provide non-customary services to their tenants and to provide services to third parties. In return for these new rules, the TRS would be subject to a number of rules designed to prevent any income from being shifted out of the taxable subsidiary to the REIT. \n",
      "   Congress created REITs in 1960 to enable small investors to invest in real estate. The REIT provisions were modeled after the rules that applied to mutual funds. If a number of requirements are met, a corporation electing to be a REIT may deduct all dividends paid to its shareholders. One of the major requirements for REIT status is that REITs must distribute virtually all of their taxable income to their shareholders. Thus, unlike other C corporations that tend to retain most of their earnings, the income tax burden for REITs is shifted to the shareholder level. Unlike partnerships, REITs cannot pass losses through to their investors. \n",
      "   REITs are subject to a number of rules to ensure their primary focus is real estate activities. For example, at least 75% of a REIT's assets must be comprised of rental real estate, mortgages, cash items and government securities. A REIT also must satisfy two income tests. First, at least 75% of a REIT's annual gross income must consist of real property rents, mortgage interest, gain from the sale of a real estate asset and certain other real estate-related sources. Second, at least 95% of a REIT's annual gross income must be derived from the income items from the above 75% test plus other ``passive income'' sources such as dividends and any type of interest. In addition, a REIT cannot own more than 10% of the voting securities of a non-REIT corporation, and the securities of a single non-REIT corporation cannot be worth more than 5% of the REIT's assets. \n",
      "   Although REITs were created in 1960, they did not really become a significant part of the real estate marketplace until the 1990s--partly because the original legislation did not permit REITs to manage their own property. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 changed this, by permitting REITs to manage their own properties through the provision of ``customary services'' to tenants. \n",
      "   The market capitalization of REITs grew from about $13 billion at the end of 1991 to over $140 billion today. The taxes generated from REITs similarly have increased, with dividends from public REITs increasing from about $1 billion in 1991 to more than $8 billion today. While REITs remain a small portion of the entire real estate sector--in the range of 10% nationally--they account for as much as half of some sectors that require immense amounts of capital, such as shopping centers. While the REIT industry has come a long way in recent years, it continues to fulfill its original mission: permitting small investors access to attractive real estate investments. Almost 90% of REIT shareholders are individuals either investing directly or through mutual funds. \n",
      "   Although REITs have seen remarkable growth in the 1990s, their ability to meet new competitive pressures in the real estate sector is in question as a result of tax law limitations on their activities. These rules limit the ability of REITs to provide full services to their tenants and to third parties. In general, REITs may only provide services to their tenants which the IRS has determined to be ``customary'' in the business, meaning services already provided by the typical real estate company in the market. REITs may only provide real estate-related services to third parties through preferred stock subsidiaries which they can own but not control. REITs are thus prohibited from offering leading edge, full service options to their tenants and limited in the use of their expertise to serve third parties. This presents competitive problems for REITs as the real estate marketplace has evolved and property owners have sought to provide a range of services to their tenants and other customers. \n",
      "   As a result, REITs increasingly have been unable to compete with privately-held partnerships and other more exclusive forms of ownership. Today, the rules prevent REITs from offering the same types of customer services as their competitors, even as such services are becoming more central to marketing efforts. Examples abound: (1) offering concierge services to office and apartment tenants to pick up tickets or dry cleaning, to walk pets, etc.; (2) offering a branded credit card at shopping malls, with rebates to be used as store credits at stores in the mall; (3) high speed Internet hook-ups, including enhanced telecommunications services (e.g., creating and maintaining a website) offered by a landlord's partner; (4) partnering with an office supply provider to offer reduced prices on office supplies; and (5) pick-up and delivery services at self-storage rentals. \n",
      "   Without greater flexibility to provide competitive services to tenants and other customers, REITs will become less and less competitive with others in the real estate marketplace. REITs will have to wait for services to be deemed ``customary.'' As a practical matter, that means a REIT must wait until the IRS concludes that almost everybody else has been providing the service. If a REIT is forced to lag the market, it can be neither competitive nor provide its investors with a satisfactory return on their investment. Certainly, this is not consistent with what Congress intended when it created REITs, and when it modified the REIT rules over the years. In keeping with the Congressional mandate to provide a sensible and effective way for the average investor to benefit from ownership of income-producing real estate, REITs should be able to provide a range of services through taxable subsidiaries. \n",
      "   The Administration's proposed Fiscal Year 2000 Budget acknowledges this problem. The Administration proposes modernizing REIT rules to permit REITs, on a limited basis, to use taxable subsidiaries to provide the services necessary to compete in the evolving real estate marketplace. The Administration proposal is a good start, but I believe additional refinements would further promote competitiveness. The legislation that we are introducing today builds upon the Administration proposal. Our bill addresses the  appropriate needs of the REIT industry and its investors in a manner consistent with the underlying rationale for REITs and the requirements of the highly competitive, evolving real estate marketplace. \n",
      "   This legislation would give greater flexibility to REITs by permitting them to establish ``taxable REIT subsidiaries'' (``TRSs'') that could provide non-customary services to tenants and services to third parties. The 5% and 10% asset tests would not apply to the TRS. REITs would continue to be subject to the 75% asset tests so the value of their TRS, together with the value of other non-real estate assets, could not exceed 25% of the total value of a REIT's assets. In addition, the REIT would have to continue to satisfy the 95% and 75% income tests, with dividends or interest from a TRS to a REIT counting towards the 95% test, but not the 75% test. Accordingly, at least 75% of a REIT's gross income would continue to consist of rents, mortgage interest, real estate capital gains and the other miscellaneous real estate-related items already listed in the Code. The income a TRS would receive from both third parties and REIT tenants would be fully subject to corporate tax. \n",
      "   To ensure that a TRS could not inappropriately reduce its corporate tax liability by shifting income to the REIT, the bill includes a number of stringent rules that limit the relationship between the REIT and the TRS. To prevent the TRS from making excessive intra-party interest payments to its affiliated REIT, the proposal contains two safeguards. One, it would apply the current anti-earnings stripping provisions of Code section 163(j) to payments between a REIT and its TRS. This would prevent the TRS from deducting intra-party interest beyond a modest amount regulated by objective criteria in the Code. Two, a 100% excise tax would be imposed on any interest payments by a TRS to its affiliated REIT to the extent the interest rate was above a commercially-reasonable rate. \n",
      "   Also, to be certain that a TRS could not reduce its tax obligations by deducting rents to its affiliated REIT, our legislation would retain the current rules under which any payments to a REIT by a related party would not be considered qualified rents for purposes of the REIT gross income tests. The only exception would be when a TRS rents less than 10% of a REIT-owned property and pays rents to the REIT comparable to the rents the REIT charges to its unrelated tenants at the same property. Under this exception, any rents paid to the REIT that turn out to be above comparable rents would be subject to a 100% excise tax. \n",
      "   Under our bill, a 100% excise tax is also imposed on any rents a REIT charges its tenants that are inflated to disguise charges for services rendered to the tenant by its affiliated TRS. Limited exceptions would be made when: (1) the TRS charges the same amounts for its services to both REIT tenants and third parties; (2) rents for comparable space are the same regardless of whether the TRS provides a service to the tenant; and (3) the TRS recognizes income for its services at least equal to 150% of its direct costs of providing the service to an affiliated REIT's tenants. \n",
      "   To discourage a REIT from allocating its expenses to its TRS (which would reduce the TRS's corporate tax obligation), the proposal would impose a 100% excise tax on any improper cost allocations between a REIT and its TRS. The Treasury Department would issue guidance on proper ways to allocate such costs. \n",
      "   Finally, the bill proposes to eliminate the use of preferred stock subsidiaries by REITs. These subsidiaries, which have been established pursuant to IRS letter rulings since 1988, allow a REIT to provide services to third parties. While the asset test rules prevent a REIT from owning more than 10% of the voting securities of these subsidiaries, they typically own more than 95% of the value of the subsidiary. We propose to eliminate these subsidiaries by prohibiting REITs from owning more than 10% of the vote or the value in another corporation other than a TRS. REITs would be given three years to convert, tax-free, their preferred stock subsidiaries to taxable REIT subsidiaries. \n",
      "   In addition, the bill includes some miscellaneous changes to the REIT rules that were under consideration when Congress approved a REIT simplification package a few years ago. The first provision deals with health care property. Under current law, a REIT can conduct a trade or business using property acquired through foreclosure for 90 days after it acquired such property, if it makes a ``foreclosure property'' election. After this period, the REIT can only conduct the trade or business through an independent contractor from whom the REIT does not derive any income. A health care REIT faces special challenges in using these rules when its lease of a nursing home or other health care property expires. \n",
      "   To remedy these challenges and to ensure that care to patients remains uninterrupted, the proposal would make two technical changes to the REIT foreclosure rules. First, the foreclosure property rules would be extended to include leases that terminate (they already apply to leases that are breached). Second, for purposes of the foreclosure rules, a health care provider would not be disqualified as an independent contractor solely because the REIT receives rental income from the provider with respect to one or more other properties. For this purpose, other rules would be made to ensure that the terms of leases of other properties could not be manipulated to circumvent this rule. \n",
      "   Another provision deals with the 95% distribution rule. From 1960 through 1980, REITs and mutual funds shared a requirement to distribute at least 90% of their taxable income. Since 1980, REITs have had to distribute 95% of their taxable income. The proposal would restore the 90% distribution requirement. \n",
      "   Mr. President, I believe this is a major improvement in the REIT rules that preserves the original intent of Congress when it first created REITs in 1960, while permitting the industry to adapt to a changing marketplace. Most importantly, these REIT modernization rules would not expand the activities that can be conducted within the REIT, they simply give the REIT greater flexibility to establish fully-taxable subsidiaries that will enable the REIT to better serve its customers. \n",
      "   This legislation is supported by the American Resort Development Association, the International Council of Shopping Centers, the National Apartment Association, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, the American Seniors Housing Association, the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, the National Association of Industrial and Office Properties, the National Association of Realtors, the National Multi Housing Council, and the National Realty Committee. \n",

      "   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Affordable Housing Opportunity Act of 1999. My colleague from my home state, BOB GRAHAM, my colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator SANTORUM, and 42 other members of the Senate join me as original cosponsors of this effort to make sure that the Low Income Housing Tax Credit is not undercut by the effects of inflation. \n",
      "   The Low Income Housing Tax Credit is one federal housing program that works. It works to produce affordable rental housing by allowing states to distribute tax credits to those who invest in apartments for low income families. It works because it is decentralized, it is market-oriented, and it relies on the private sector. \n",
      "   The Low Income Housing Tax Credit works because it is based on sound economics. This is in stark contrast to the alternative government approach to the problem of a scarcity of privately owned, affordable housing units, the approach of rent control. Under rent  control, owners are restricted in the price they can charge for their apartments. Since this dramatically reduces the return on their investment in housing, potential owners of rental units take their money elsewhere. The result, confirmed in a study of rent control in California in the early 1990s, is that rent control actually reduces the number of rental units available for low income families. \n",
      "   There is a better way. The Low Income Housing Tax Credit is that way. Under this program, tax credits are allocated by states and their localities to investors in low income housing. In return for agreeing to charge low rents for the units produced, the investors receive a tax credit that makes up for the financial risk of the investment. Instead of mandating low rents, the program provides an incentive for property owners to charge low rents. \n",
      "   And, as Adam Smith would have predicted, this incentive does the job. Since 1987, state agencies have allocated over $3 billion in Housing Credits to help finance nearly one million apartments for low income families, including 70,000 apartments in 1997. In my own state of Florida, the Credit is responsible for helping finance over 52,000 apartments for low income families, including 3,300 apartments in 1997. The demand for Housing Credits nationwide currently outstrips supply by more than three to one. \n",
      "   Despite the success of the Housing Credit in meeting affordable rental housing needs, the apartments it helps finance can barely keep pace with the nearly 100,000 low cost apartments which are demolished, abandoned, or converted to market rents each year. This is because the credit has been set at an annual amount of $1.25 per resident of each state, since its creation in 1986. To make up for the loss in value of the credit due to inflation, we propose to increase this amount to $1.75 per resident and to index the amount for future inflation. It has been estimated that this will increase the stock of critically needed low income apartments by 27,000 each year. \n",
      "   There has long existed in this body a dedication to affordable housing, an interest that knows no party lines. One of the major, early proponents of federally supported affordable housing was Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio, known in his day as Mr. Republican, whose monument chimes regularly just a few hundred yards from here. With this strong, bipartisan pedigree, I have no hesitation in asking my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me to enact this proposal--which is similar to one contained in the President's budget and is supported by the nation's governors and mayors and the affordable housing community--to ensure the continued vitality of a program that works. \n",

      "   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I am here today because finally, Tax Freedom Day has arrived--the day the average American has earned enough income to cover his or her Federal, State and local taxes for the year. Only today--after one-third of the year has already passed--have our working men and women earned enough money to pay their taxes for the year! This is truly amazing, and it is also truly wrong. \n",
      "   Tax Freedom Day has moved successively later into the year for the past 7 years, as the Federal Government seeks to claim a larger and larger portion of the American family income. Since 1993, Federal tax revenues have grown 52 percent faster than personal income growth. And last year alone, Federal revenues grew 80 percent faster than personal income. \n",
      "   Florida's Tax Freedom Day is even later--Floridians will not finish earning enough to pay their taxes for the year until Friday, May 14. They also shoulder the 5th heaviest total tax burden in the country. \n",
      "   In 1999, Federal, State and local governments are projected to collect an average of $10,298 in tax revenue for every person in the country. This year, the Federal Government will collect more tax revenue as a share of GDP--that is 20.7 percent--than at any time since 1944. This is the highest level in peacetime history. \n",
      "   If that isn't enough to put the high Federal tax take into perspective, let me share with you a few examples of just how much taxes impede our freedom every day of the year. \n",
      "   I brought with me a daily tax clock to illustrate just how many different times we are taxed in ways we may not even realize. Think about the different things you do in the course of your average day. Planning your family's summer vacation? Forty percent of the cost of an airline ticket is taxes! When you drive to and from work today, 54 percent of the price of a gallon of gasoline is taxes. Did you call your mother on Mother's Day? Fifty percent of the cost of your phone bill is due to taxes. \n",
      "   Taxes infringe on our freedom--our freedom to work, our freedom to invest and our freedom to provide for our families. It is more apparent than ever that the mammoth Federal Government we have created will never be satisfied--if there is money to be had, the Federal Government will take it. \n",
      "   That is why it is more important than ever to provide tax relief to our families. We have a balanced budget, and soon we will be working with a Federal surplus. If the Federal Government has its way, this overpayment of taxes by the American people will be spent in Washington on new Federal programs. We need to give the American people their money back. I have proposed a tax plan which will do just that by, No. 1, providing tax relief for all American income taxpayers, No. 2, encouraging economic growth and, No. 3, ensuring U.S. technological leadership in the 21st century. \n",
      "   We need to ensure the United States keeps its status as an economic powerhouse in the next millennium. The Federal Government's role in ensuring this happens is to cut taxes and get out of the way to give the American people the freedom to pursue their own dream--not Washington's. \n",

      "   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join my colleague JOHN BREAUX in sponsoring the Medicare Psychiatric Hospital Prospective payment System Act of 1999. \n",
      "   This legislation will ensure the continuance of available impatient psychiatric care by reforming how Medicare pays for services in free-standing psychiatric hospitals and psychiatric units of general hospitals. It will establish a prospective payment system (PPS) Currently psychiatric hospitals are the only institutional providers of care under Medicare not scheduled to move to a PPS system. \n",
      "   The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) made major changes in the way psychiatric hospitals are paid. It reduced incentive payments and imposed a limit on what will be paid. The result of this was that many of these providers were hit by a big cut in the first year with no transition period to adjust to the reductions. It is important that these cuts not be continued because patient care may be put at risk. A recent study found that 84% of psychiatric hospitals had payment reductions due to BBA. The average margin went from minus 3% to negative 8.7%. \n",
      "   This legislation proposes to transition psychiatric inpatient providers to a PPS which will allow these institutions to be able to plan and adjust for the future and insure their ability to provide quality care. The proposal also provides a measure of financial relief by limiting payment reductions to no more than 5% in the next two years. This relief will then be paid back in a few years under PPS. After the third year, PPS will be in effect and per diem rates can be adjusted downward by the Secretary of Health and Human Services to pay back savings temporarily lost through the limitation of initial payment reductions. The goal is for the bill to be budget neutral over five years and fully comply with the BBA. \n",
      "   The most important feature of this legislation is that it moves psychiatric facilities out of a cost based system and into a system where they will be paid prospectively, like most other Medicare Providers, and can manage their finances effectively to provide high quality psychiatric care. \n",

      "   Mr. President, my job as chairman of the Joint Economic Committee is to help Congress stay focused on the right policies to keep the U.S. economy energized. What that comes down to is finding ways to make sure Washington does less of what today it does most--tax, spend, and regulate--in order to let the American people do more of what they do best--which is to build, create and innovate. \n",
      "   With that in mind, I instructed the JEC staff to focus on creating a tax plan that would accomplish three goals: first, provide tax relief for all American income taxpayers; second, promote even stronger economic growth; and third, ensure continued technological leadership in the 21st century. The plan I would like to talk about today accomplishes these three goals, and does so within the parameters of the on-budget surplus as estimated in this year's budget resolution. It does not use one penny from the Social Security surplus. \n",
      "   As Ronald Reagan once said, when he was defining a taxpayer--``that's someone who works for the Federal Government but doesn't have to take a civil service examination.'' This comment really gets to the heart of how the size and scope of the Federal Government affects the way we live our lives. Americans are spending more and more time working to give more and more of their hard-earned dollars in taxes every year to the Federal Government. \n",
      "   According to the non-partisan Tax Foundation, the average dual-income family will work until May 11 this year to pay their federal state and local taxes. So, as of today, the average American family has not even finished working to pay off their taxes for 1999. \n",
      "   This year, the Federal Government will collect more tax revenue as a share of GDP than at any time since 1944. This is the highest level in peacetime history--20.7 percent of GDP consumed by the Federal Government. \n",

      "   We have a balanced budget in 1999 and we've got balanced budgets as far as the eye can see. Soon, we'll have a federal surplus as far as the eye can see. \n",
      "   Our challenge now is to deal with that surplus. And, I think it's easy to see what will happen to this overpayment by the American taxpayer--if we leave it in Washington's hands. There will be numerous new government programs and they will be paid for by the Federal surplus. \n",
      "   We have to change the terms of debate--and we have to do it now before the surplus is spent. First, let's not forget that the American economy does not exist to feed the Federal budget. Now that the budget is balanced, we have to get our priorities straight. \n",
      "   To begin with: there is no such thing as ``public money.'' Every dollar of the Federal surplus was paid into the U.S. Treasury by American taxpayers. If we have a persistent surplus, we have to give the money back. \n",
      "   For years, my fellow Republicans and I argued that it was wrong for the Government to spend more than it took in. We were right. But now, it is equally wrong for the Government to take in more than it spends. \n",
      "   Yes, we should cut taxes so that people can keep more of what they earn. Yes, we should cut taxes because lower taxes spur economic growth. But the real rationale for lowering taxes--the reason tax cuts are an article of faith in the Republican Party--is that high taxes trespass on our freedom--our freedom to work, our freedom to invest, our freedom to support our families. \n",
      "   So in my mind, it is not a matter of if we cut, but how much, and how can we maximize the pro-growth impact of whatever tax cuts we decide to enact. \n",
      "   With these thoughts in mind, I would like to focus on what they Joint Economic Committee staff has come up with as a way to give the American income taxpayer meaningful tax relief, promote savings and economic growth, and ensure the United States remains a technological leader in the 21st century. And, Mr. President, I would like to elaborate on how this plan will accomplish each of these goals. \n",
      "   The first goal is tax cuts for all American income taxpayers. \n",
      "   Under this plan we would double the standard deduction to $14,400 for married filers and raise the standard deduction for single filers to $7,200. Increasing the standard deduction would provide much-needed relief to all low-income taxpayers. Moreover, this provision would significantly reduce the much-discussed marriage penalty and simplify the Tax Code. Nearly three-  quarters of all taxpayers use the standard deduction and would benefit from this increase. \n",
      "   In addition, our plan would repeal the 1993 Clinton tax increase on Social Security benefits. In 1993, President Clinton imposed this tax increase on the elderly's benefits because he said it was needed to eliminate the budget deficit. Since there is no longer a deficit, we no longer need this tax. It is time to repeal this unnecessary surcharge on Social Security recipients. \n",

But as I have listened to it, and as I have observed my colleagues over the last several days, as the lobbying on both sides of this issue has been going on, and seeing people move back and forth, I have become concerned about how people are making decisions. \n",
      "   Finally, we have gotten down to the crux of the matter here, and that is, at least in my opinion, how monetary policy in the United States is going to be carried out. \n",
      "   I believe it is so important that we focus on the issue of monetary policy, because one of the underlying strengths, one of the major factors in the economic growth that we have experienced for almost 16 years is the role of the Federal Reserve, a Federal Reserve that has been committed to price stability. \n",
      "   To do something that will weaken the influence of the Federal Reserve with respect to monetary policy would be a tragic mistake. \n",
      "   Here is my reasoning as to how this will come about. The Treasury is selling their idea to Members that all we really want to do is give the bankers a choice--that seems to be a fair and reasonable thing to do--let them decide. \n",
      "   I was in the banking business. This is really not a choice. You are saying to the bankers, you make a choice about where you are going to put this. They know where the cost of capital is the cheapest, and the cost of capital is going to be the cheapest in an operating subsidiary. \n",
      "   Why is the operating subsidiary going to be the cheapest cost to them? Because there is a subsidy attached to the bank, and so the bankers naturally will go to where their costs are the cheapest. They will, in fact, put these new powers into an operating subsidiary. Having done that, there is no longer a need for them to be involved in a holding company. The holding company is the vehicle, if you will, that allows the Federal Reserve to carry out its monetary policy. \n",
      "   The second thing that is going to occur is by voting for the use of an operating subsidiary, you are really saying you want the taxpayers to expand the subsidy that goes into the banking industry or into the financial services industry. That is an individual decision that people can make. But I think it is wrong to try to approach this question about whether I am for the bankers or whether I am not for the bankers. This is an issue about whether you want to have a monetary policy that is of value to this country. \n",
      "   I ask Members to consider what has happened in this country in these past 16 years as far as growth is concerned. The foundation of that growth has been the commitment that this Federal Reserve, and Alan Greenspan in particular, has had to the objective of price stability. We have finally reached the point where we have attained price stability, and we are talking about tinkering around with legislation that could lessen the influence of the Federal Reserve. \n",
      "   As Senator DOMENICI indicated earlier, as you lessen that influence, you are going to increase the influence in the executive branch over the banking industry and monetary policy in this country. That would be a tragedy. \n",
      "   I ask my colleagues who may be wavering on this issue, this is not a choice between Secretary Rubin or Alan Greenspan or commercial banks. This is a decision about monetary policy in this country and who should, in fact, have control of it. \n",

We all know that legislation to overhaul the bank regulatory structure is long overdue, and I join many of my colleagues in thanking the chairman for his hard work in writing this bill and bringing it to the floor. \n",
      "   I will begin by quoting the words of the Senate Banking Committee report, which I believe presents a strong case for financial modernization. It states:  \n",
      "   The argument for legislation to rationalize our financial structure is strong. Regulatory and court decisions have eliminated many of the barriers between commercial and investment banking. The barriers separating commercial banks from investment banks have been perforated in both directions. Finally, changes in the technology and practice of financial intermediation have rendered the restrictions of Glass-Steagall increasingly ineffective and obsolete.  \n",
      "   There is nothing particularly remarkable about that language, Mr. President. In fact, those same arguments will be made by many of my colleagues here today. But what is remarkable about the statement I just read is that it comes from a committee report on banking legislation in 1991. Just as I believed those words to be significant 8 years ago, I believe them to be even more so today. Unfortunately, there was no overhaul of our banking system in 1991. And despite much hard work and a clear need for action, there has been none since. We are long overdue for this debate and I am pleased the Senate is addressing this important issue. \n",
      "   Freedom and free enterprise have allowed our corporate and financial institutions to respond to changing times and to adapt to a changing financial environment. But this ability has reached its limits within the confines of present law. For our financial institutions to continue to grow, to compete, and to evolve, we must give them a new legislative climate in which to operate. That is the purpose of the bill before us today. \n",
      "   Mr. President, our banking system is truly a model for the world. Emerging economies from Asia to Africa to Central Europe look to the United States for the blueprint and technical expertise to build an effective financial infrastructure. This is happening because we have found a remarkable balance between community banks and global institutions, between the regulators and the regulated, between the States and the Federal Government, and between ordinary people and the money they need to finance their hopes and dreams. In recent years, we have witnessed a wave of high-profile mergers, as institutions across the sectors hope to create ``synergy'' from offering a broad range of financial products to an expanding global customer base. For their part, many smaller, community-based institutions are using the new regulatory authorities to offer their customers one-stop shopping for individual financial needs--from ordinary retail banking to insurance products and securities instruments. \n",
      "   All of this is very important to the continued financial well-being of our Nation and to the global competitiveness of our financial services industry. However, the expansions I speak of are not taking place with the approval of the Congress and are not occurring through any action on our part to change the law. Rather, these things are happening because--as the 1991 report mentioned--court decisions and the broadened interpretations of present law by the banking regulators have allowed them to take place in an ad hoc manner. In order to access the right to affiliate with other sectors, financial companies have to jump over increasingly complicated regulatory hurdles in order to adapt and survive. It is high time Congress weighed in on this important trend. It is high time we cleared the way for these affiliations and repealed the underlying web of Depression-era restrictions on our banking industry. \n",
      "   That is what we accomplish in the bill before us today, Mr. President. This legislation allows companies to diversify holdings by lifting the prohibitions on affiliations among banks, insurance companies, and securities firms, thus allowing them to compete fully in a free-market environment. If Congress fails to act, we will once  again limit the potential of our financial sector and we will continue to impose needless and unnecessary regulatory burdens on individual financial institutions. The other body is moving with its own legislation. The Senate needs to act now to ensure that our financial sector is on solid footing for the new century. \n",
      "   The bill before us repeals the Depression-era Glass-Steagall law prohibiting affiliations between commercial and investment banks. It allows banks and insurance companies \n",
      "   to affiliate under the same corporate umbrella. It contains provisions outlining the appropriate regulation of bank sales of insurance, and it allows banks with assets of less than $1 billion to engage in a broader range of financial services through operating subsidiaries. Of course, Mr. President, the relationships between these entities are carefully constructed to ensure institutional safety and soundness and that the taxpayer-insured deposits of retail banking institutions are protected. \n",
      "   The structure provided for in this legislation will end the ad hoc expansion and administration of our banking sector and provide the industry with a clear roadmap for the 21st century. In my view, it will lead to greater stability, enhanced safety and soundness, and improved choices for customers and consumers. \n",

      "   I have spoken on this issue throughout my time in the Senate serving on the Banking Committee which now is into its 11th year. I also make these comments from the perspective of an individual who was president of a small bank in southwest Florida for 5 years out of a 16-year banking career. \n",
      "   One would think, listening to the comments that have been made by the distinguished Senator from Maryland, that we were proposing to repeal CRA. We are not proposing that at all. There may be Members who want to do that, but that is not what the issue is about. The issue is about regulatory overkill. \n",
      "   This little bank that I was president of had about $60 million in assets--very small bank--in a community that was developed, one of these Florida developments, that began in the late 1950s. To suggest that this small community bank in a very well-defined and confined market was not providing resources to that market is just absurd. If we did not lend money into that market, we would, in fact, have gone broke. So all I am suggesting is the amendment being proposed here is being sold as if we were trying to repeal CRA. The information I have is with the committee position: Only 2.8 percent of the total assets of the banking industry in America are affected by this carve-out, 2.8 percent. There were 16,000 banks audited over a 9-year period and only three of those banks--I am talking about small banks now--only three of those banks were found to be significantly out of compliance. \n",
      "   Small banks in America need some regulatory relief. That is all we are suggesting here. Again, my experience was this little bank of $60 million in assets had to assign one individual whose job it was to put pins into a map in our market showing where we had made real estate loans. That is all we had to do. But I had to assign one person to do that. She had to put programs into effect in the bank to make sure we were complying with lending to our community. It was the only place we could have loaned. \n",
      "   So the idea that we needed to have the Community Reinvestment Act for my bank and for small community banks is absurd. I ask my colleagues to reject the amendment and to support the committee position. \n",
      "   I yield the remainder of my time. \n",

      "   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, let me, first of all, thank Senator DODD for his vote for this resolution. I respect immensely his viewpoint and what he has stated over all these years, but I respectfully disagree with him. Again, I will just point out, all we are suggesting here is that the least America can do is to say we ought to ask the United Nations to condemn Fidel Castro for his human rights violations. That is not an extreme position to take, to ask the world body to condemn Fidel Castro for human rights violations. \n",
      "   The reason we are doing this is because I think it is appropriate to respond to the impression that has been created over these last several months after the Pope visited Cuba. There has been this kind of love affair that Cuba has changed, that the world is now going to open up. The Senator said a moment ago, if Cuba would open up, if we would open up, we could come together. \n",
      "   Clearly, what has happened since the Pope's visit, Fidel Castro has arrested more dissidents than he has released following the Pope's visit. He has instituted new laws which restrict the freedom of speech, even more restrictive than in previous years. He arrested 15 people trying to celebrate the birthday of Martin Luther King this year, and just this month he arrested and sentenced four prominent activists for writing about the basic rights of the Cuban people.  \n",

      "   to speak about Cuba and why the United States must make every effort to pass a resolution in Geneva at the U.N. Human Rights Commission condemning the Cuban Government. \n",
      "   The reality which I seek to convey today is very simply stated. Fidel Castro continues to run Cuba with absolute power, based upon the failed ideals of the Marxist revolution that he led 40 years ago. He is a tyrant, a dictator, and an enemy of freedom, democracy, and respect for basic human dignity. \n",
      "   As many of my colleagues know, I have been reflecting on my Senate career lately as I weighed my decision on seeking another term. Let me share one of those memories with you right now. \n",
      "   It was October 19, 1987, when I announced my candidacy for the Senate. I traveled to Key West, the southern most point in the Continental United States, to make my announcement. I chose this location for one simple reason. I knew my passion for foreign policy arose from a deeply held conviction that America's freedom could not be taken for granted, that our freedom was not complete so long as others suffered under the yoke of tyranny. Only 90 miles from where I declared my aspiration to be a U.S. Senator in order to take part in the fight against the enemies of freedom, Fidel Castro ruled with a failed ideology and a cruel iron fist. \n",
      "   It seems that I have been in the Senate for a long time--10 years--but if I were to travel to Key West today, I am sad to say, I could still point toward Cuba and ask the same questions I did on October 19, 1987: What does it mean to live in peace if there is no freedom to worship God, no freedom to choose our livelihood, no freedom to read or speak the truth or to live for the dream of handing over a better life to our children and our grandchildren? Peace without freedom is false. The Cuban people are only free to serve their masters in war and in poverty. \n",
      "   Mr. President, I have many good friends in the Senate, and I have great respect for my colleagues. We share so much of our lives with each other each day. And even though we are divided on many issues, in our hearts there can be no division on our feelings for the suffering people of Cuba. \n",
      "   The island so close to our shores serves as a tragic reminder of the human cost of tyranny and oppression and that freedom is not free. \n",
      "   Let me propose today that Fidel Castro has not changed in 10 years; in fact, he has not changed in 40 years. In the history books, 40 years can be covered in a single sentence. But in Cuba, it can also be an eternity. \n",
      "   I think about the 12 years since I made that speech. How many people have suffered and died needlessly in 12 years? How many screams of agony have reached for the heavens from Havana in 12 years? How many tears of sorrow and anguish have fallen in 12 years? I fear we will never know the true scale of suffering, even though it takes place so close to our shores. \n",
      "   Some of us have served in the Senate for a few years, some of us for 10 or 12, and some of us have been here for 30 years or more. Think what it must be like serving instead in one of Fidel Castro's prisons for all that time. In Cuba you could be imprisoned simply for doing what we do each day, and that is engage in the debate of ideas. Think about how different our lives would be if we lived in a similar environment. \n",
      "   I assure you, Mr. President, that the human spirit is a powerful thing. We know that throughout the world and throughout history mankind has struggled for freedom against the greatest of obstacles. That struggle lives, breathes, sweats, and thrives in Cuba today. But it does so at a great cost. \n",
      "   I have two short stories I want to share to demonstrate the price being paid in Cuba today. \n",
      "   There is a famous man known as Antunez. He began supporting freedom in Cuba in 1980. He has been in and out of prison for much of his adult life. As of February 1999, reports out of the prisons have him in poor health. \n",
      "   I want to read a quote from a letter he wrote and successfully smuggled out of Cuba 2 years ago. I quote:  \n",
      "   On March 15 [1997], it will be seven years that I have been imprisoned but I have yet to lose my faith and confidence in the final triumph of our struggle. I am proud and satisfied that they will have been unable to--and will never be able to--bend my will, because I am defending a just and noble cause, the rights of man and the freedom of my country.  \n",
      "   A second story: I have recently seen a March 10, 1999, statement of Dr. Omar del Pozo, which I want to share with you today. He was a prisoner of conscience, sentenced to 15 years in prison for promoting democracy and civil society in Cuba. Through the intercession of Pope John Paul II, Dr. Pozo was released and exiled to Canada after serving 6 years of the sentence. \n",
      "   It is interesting to note the comments of a man who owes his freedom from Cuba's prisons to the Pope's visit to Cuba. Listen to what he has to say about the so-called changes taking place within the Cuban Government. And I am now quoting:  \n",
      "   In Castro's man-eating prisons, lives are swallowed, mangled, and spit out in what can only be described as his revolving-door of infamy. Some may claim that the fact that I am able to stand before you here today is because I am a product of engagement with Castro. While I am certainly grateful for the international outcry that created pressure on Castro to release me, it would be negligent of me not to recognize that as long as the dictator remains in power, there will continue to be political prisoners who are destined to become pawns to be handed over as tokens depending on the occasion.........my release in no way benefited the hundreds, perhaps thousands, of men and women who were left behind.  \n",
      "   Dr. Pozo's statement certainly rings true--that the visit of the Pope and his personal release and exile from his home do not, counter to popular belief, indicate a new day in Cuba. \n",
      "   He continues on in his statement. Again, I quote:  \n",
      "   Forty years have passed, and a new millennium dawns, and still political prisoners exist in a country only 90 miles from the shores of the freest nation on earth........In the confusion of cliches Cuba has become in the mass media: Castro and cigars, Castro and tourism, Castro and baseball, the terrible tragedy of Cubans and their legitimate needs and desires takes a backseat to the priorities set by the Comandante en Jefe and his regime. The truly tragic part is that there are some who, in the name of profit, are willing to compromise justice and play by his rules, with no regard for the welfare of the Cuban people.  \n",
      "   Just as actions indicate no improvement in the Government of Cuba, one could argue that things are not really getting worse. In fact, the recent crackdown in Cuba is only a manifestation of the nature of the ruling regime. Again, let me quote from Dr. Pozo:  \n",
      "   These past days, I have heard even experienced Cuba observers question why Castro has raised the level of repression at this point in time, considering the many gestures of goodwill he has received internationally prior to and following the Papal visit. The only possible answer is that it is the nature of the beast. Castro can not help it any more than he can help being a totalitarian dictator. It is who he is and will always be. It is because he is motivated by one thing and one thing alone: [and that is] absolute power. He wants to continue to stand on the backs of the Cuban people and he will persecute, torture and kill in order to accomplish his goal of being Cuba's ``dictator for life.'' By now, everyone knows who Castro is and what he is capable of. From this point on, the field can only be divided between those who are willing to overlook his crimes and those who are not.   \n",
      "   Again, I just point out, those were not my words. These are the words of an individual who was released from Castro's prison because of the pressure brought on by the international community and by the Pope's visit. What he is saying here is that nothing has changed as a result of the Pope's visit to Cuba. He is saying nothing has changed. And he is saying to us--not me saying, but he is saying to us--that ``the field can only be divided [now] between those who are willing to overlook [Castro's] crimes and those who are not.'' \n",
      "   Mr. President, in conclusion, let me once again say freedom is not free, but it is the most valuable thing that we know; it is, in fact, the core of all human progress. Freedom has everything to do with our spiritual, physical, and political lives. Without it--without freedom--what would we do? It is important to think about this in order to appreciate the words of the brave men and women in Cuba fighting for freedom, because they are, after all, fighting for everything and paying a large price indeed. \n",
      "   I want to reach out to my colleagues today. We loathe tyranny and oppression. So let us stand united behind our delegation in Geneva; let us proclaim our views at the United Nations Human Rights Commission. Let us stand tall and speak with unity, conviction, and strength. Let us proclaim: ``The \n",
      "   United States of America abhors tyranny and loves freedom. We oppose the enemies of liberty and we support those struggling for LIBERTAD.'' \n",
      "   That, Mr. President, represents the meaning of this resolution in its entirety. I hope my colleagues will join me today in making this most important statement. \n",

      "    Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I come before the Senate today with my esteemed colleague and friend, Senator GRAHAM, to introduce the Florida Federal Judgeship Act of 1999. I would not be here today if I did not wholeheartedly believe that the problem facing the court system in the Middle and Southern Districts of Florida is one of the most acute judgeship problems in the nation. If judicial resources are not increased in these two districts, the problem will become irreversible. Mr. President, the situation that presently exists in Florida rises to the level of an emergency and thus, the problem needs attention today. \n",
      "   The legislation that Senator GRAHAM and I are introducing would create seven new judgeships for the state of Florida. The Middle District would receive five new permanent judgeships, and the Southern District would receive two new permanent judgeships. These numbers were officially recommended by the United States Judicial Conference earlier this week. \n",
      "   The Middle District of Florida is nearly 400 miles, spanning from the Georgia border on the northeast side to the south of Naples on the southwest coast of Florida. This district includes, among others, the cities of Jacksonville, Orlando, and Tampa. The Southern District encompasses Ft. Lauderdale and Miami, along with other cities in the southern portion of the state. \n",
      "   Additional judgeship positions have not been created for these districts since 1990. Since this time, the Middle District alone has had a 62 percent increase in the total number of cases filed. Moreover, Florida's population has increased nearly twice as fast as the nation during the 1990s. By 2025, the United States Census Bureau projects Florida will surpass New York as the third largest state with 20.7 million residents. \n",
      "   Each year, Florida becomes a winter home to people from all over the United States and the world. In addition, the Middle and Southern Districts  are home to major tourist attractions such as Disney World, Universal Studios, Sea World, Busch Gardens, and South Beach. The heavy flow of both winter residents and tourism, along with Florida's growing number of permanent residents, causes the needs of these two judicial districts to be unique in this nation. \n",
      "   In addition, the Middle District contains the federal correctional center at Coleman. When the penitentiary is completed in Spring 2001, this will be one of the largest prison complexes in the country and the largest in the state of Florida. The capacity at Coleman will be approximately 4,700 inmates and all complaints filed by these prisoners regarding the facilities and their individual care will be sent to the Middle District for resolution. \n",
      "   To add to the problem, a portion of the Middle District has been designated a High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area. While I am pleased that Florida will be receiving additional assistance in the war against drugs, we also must recognize that this law enforcement initiative is expected to dramatically impact narcotic related arrests and therefore, prosecutions in the Middle District. \n",
      "   Thus, it is apparent that without the addition of new judges, access to justice will no longer be swift in the Middle and Southern Districts. To provide Floridians with a safe environment and access to justice, a court system must be put in place which can handle the demands of this dynamic and growing part of our country. Accordingly, I urge the Judiciary Committee and the full Senate to consider and pass this legislation expeditiously.  \n",

      "   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today, along with Senators GRAMS, LIEBERMAN, and KYL, I introduce the Printed Circuit Investment Act of 1999. This bill would allow manufacturers of printed wiring boards and printed wiring assemblies, known as the electronic interconnection industry, to depreciate their production equipment in 3 years rather than the 5 year period under current law. \n",
      "   As we approach the 21st century, our Nation's Tax Code should not stand in the way of technological progress. Printed wiring boards and assemblies are literally central to our economy, as they are the nerve centers of nearly every electronic device from camcorders and televisions to medical devices, computers and defense systems. But the Tax Code places U.S. manufacturers at the disadvantage relative to their Asian competitors, because of different depreciation treatment. This disadvantage is particularly difficult for U.S. firms to bear, as the interconnection industry consists overwhelmingly of small firms that cannot easily absorb the costs inflicted by an irrationally-long depreciated schedule. \n",
      "   As technology continues to advance at light speed, the exhilaration of competition in a dynamic market is dampened by the effects of a tax code that has not kept pace with these changes. Obsolete interconnection manufacturing equipment is kept on the books long after this equipment has gone out the door. Companies with the competitive fire to enter such a rapidly-evolving industry must constantly invest in new state-of-the art equipment, replacing obsolete equipment every 18 to 36 months just to remain competitive. U.S. investments in new printed wiring board and assembly manufacturing equipment have nearly tripled since 1991--growing from $847 million to an estimated $2.4 billion. \n",
      "   But this investment is taxed at an artificially-high rate, because deductions for the cost of the equipment are spread over a period that is several years longer than justified. The industry is at the mercy of tax laws passed in the 1980s, which were based on 1970s-era electronics technology. It is no wonder that the market share of U.S. interconnection companies has been cut in half over this period. Our Tax Code should not continue to undermine the competitiveness of American businesses. The opportunity is before us to correct the tax laws that dictate how rapidly board manufacturers and electronic assemblers can depreciate equipment needed to fabricate and assemble circuit boards. \n",
      "   The Printed Circuit Investment Act of 1999 will provide modest tax relief to the electronics interconnection industry and the 250,000 Americans, residing in every state in the Union, whose jobs rely on the success of this industry. This industry should get fair and accurate tax treatment.  \n",

      "    Mr. MACK. Mr. President, in an effort to help increase awareness and education about cervical cancer, and to pay tribute to women who have battled the disease, today I am submitting a Senate Resolution to designate the month of January as ``National Cervical Health Month.'' I am pleased that Senator DIANNE FEINSTEIN and 31 bipartisan colleagues in the Senate have agreed to be original co-sponsors of this Senate Resolution. I understand that Representative JUANITA MILLENDER-MCDONALD will be introducing similar legislation in the United States House of Representatives, and I would like to commend her for the leadership she has shown in this important effort. \n",
      "   I would also like to pay tribute to Ms. Carol Ann Armenti, Director of the Center for Cervical Health in Toms River, New Jersey. Ms. Armenti has worked tirelessly on behalf of cervical cancer patients and their families, and she has been a true leader in educating women about this disease. In January, her organization, along with the American Medical Women's Association, launched the National Cervical Cancer Public Education Campaign. The leadership of Ms. Armenti will have a lasting impact upon the lives of women of today, and future generations will be the beneficiaries of her work. \n",
      "   Mr. President, the issue of cervical cancer is one which is deeply personal to my wife, Priscilla, and to me. In 1990, our daughter, Debbie, was diagnosed with cervical cancer. Because of our family history with cancer, Debbie was aware that she had an increased risk of cancer and she made sure to take advantage of early detection screening procedures. Fortunately, her cervical cancer was detected at an early stage, and she was treated successfully with surgery. Not long after her treatment, she have birth to our third grandson. Debbie's experience with cervical cancer exemplifies the fact that early detection saves lives. \n",
      "   According to the American Cancer Society, nearly 1,000 women in Florida will be diagnosed with cervical cancer in 1999. This year, Florida will have the third largest number of new cases of cervical cancer. Yet, despite significant progress being made in the war on cancer, not all segments of the U.S. population have benefitted to the fullest extent from the advances made in the understanding of cancer. According to the U.S. Institute of Medicine report, ``The Unequal Burden of Cancer,'' rates of cervical cancer are significantly higher in Hispanic and African-American women. We simply must reinforce our efforts to eradicate this terrible disease. \n",
      "   Research, education, and early detection are the most effective weapons we have in the war on cervical cancer.  \n",
      "   Research is the key to finding a cure for cervical cancer, and significant progress is being made in this regard. Last month, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) took the rarely-used step of issuing a Clinical Announcement urging physicians to give strong consideration to adding chemotherapy to radiation therapy in the treatment of invasive cervical cancer. According to NCI Director Rick Klausner, this will likely change the standard of treatment for cervical cancer. Dr. Mitchell Morris of the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center called this new treatment approach, ``the first fundamental advance in the treatment of cervical cancer in more than 40 years.'' \n",
      "   I'm also proud to say that several cutting-edge cervical cancer studies are taking place in my home state of Florida. Scientists at the University of Miami Sylvester Cancer Center are studying a new type of cervical cancer immunotherapy. They are developing ``killer cells'' specifically designed to target cancer cells which express human papilloma virus (HPV). By eradicating these cells, the hope is to kill the tumor, even if the cancer has spread. At the H. Lee Moffitt Comprehensive Cancer Center in Tampa, studies are underway to develop a cervical cancer vaccine using some of the same characteristics of the human papilloma virus. They are also examining biomarkers to detect cervical cancer before malignant changes occur. \n",

And any state that he might declare, outside of the peace process, would be illegitimate, irresponsible, and wrong. \n",
      "   I am pleased to see this initiative has been cosponsored by 90 Senators as of this morning. But we must realize that this show of support grows from a very deep and heartfelt concern. We want peace to succeed, but Chairman Arafat's threat to unilaterally declare a state clearly threatens peace. \n",

Our bill prohibits the Treasury Department from issuing regulations that would impose taxes on U.S. companies merely because one of their subsidiaries pays money to itself. \n",
      "   As a general rule, U.S. corporations pay U.S. corporate income tax on the earnings of their foreign subsidiaries only when those earnings are actually distributed to the U.S. parent companies. An exception to this general rule is contained in subpart F of the Internal Revenue Code, which accelerates the income tax liability of U.S. parent companies under certain circumstances. The Treasury Department has announced, in Notice 98-35, an intention to issue regulations that will accelerate income tax liability for U.S. companies--not based on the specific circumstances enumerated in subpart F, but instead on a new ``interpretation'' of the ``policies'' that Treasury infers from that 36-year-old provision. This action crosses the line between administering the laws and making the laws, and cannot be allowed by Congress. \n",
      "   Notice 98-35 concerns so-called ``hybrid arrangements.'' These involve business entities that are considered separate corporations for foreign tax purposes, but are viewed as one company with a branch office for U.S. purposes. U.S. companies organize their subsidiaries in this manner to reduce the amount of foreign taxes they owe. Transactions between a subsidiary and its branch have no impact on U.S. taxable income of the parent, as its subsidiary is merely paying money to itself. But the Treasury Department intends to impose a tax on the U.S. parent to penalize it for reducing the foreign taxes it owes. \n",
      "   This effort is wrong for several reasons. First, the Treasury Department possesses only the power to issue regulations to administer the laws passed by Congress. New rules based on Congressional purpose are known as laws, and under the Constitution laws are made by Congress. \n",
      "   Second, the Treasury Department is elevating one policy underlying subpart F--taxing domestic and foreign operations in the same manner--over the other policy of maintaining the competitiveness of U.S. companies in foreign markets. This proposed tax would put U.S.-owned subsidiaries at a competitive disadvantage. \n",
      "   Finally, the Treasury Department should not impose a tax on U.S. companies to force these companies to reorganize in a way that increases the taxes they owe to foreign countries. The Treasury Department is not the tax collector for other nations. And by raising the foreign tax bills of U.S. companies, the Treasury Department is also increasing the size of foreign tax credits and thereby reducing U.S. tax revenues. \n",
      "   The Treasury Department is not only making policy that it has no right to make, it is also making bad policy. Our bill places a moratorium on this lawmaking. It also directs the Treasury  Secretary to study these issues and submit a report to the tax-writing committees of Congress. Many people and organizations, including the Treasury Department, desire changes in the tax laws. But only Congress has the power to make these changes, and this is a power we intend to keep. \n",

      "   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, the Tibetan people are suffering today in the name of freedom, and I am pleased to rise with Senator MOYNIHAN to submit a resolution in solemn commemoration of this day, March 10, in Tibetan history. \n",
      "   It was on March 10, 1959 that the Tibetan people said, ``enough is enough.'' The city of Lhasa organized into what later became known as the ``Lhasa revolt'' on this day forty years ago, to protect their beloved leader, the 14th Dalai Lama, and to reject the impositions of Beijing. Let me provide some details. \n",
      "   The new communist government in Beijing sent an army to invade Tibet in 1949. The People's Liberation Army quickly overwhelmed Tibetan defenses. In 1951, a Tibetan delegation went to Beijing to negotiate a peace agreement. But negotiation is too kind of a word. The Tibetan delegation was forced to sign a PRC-written document known as the ``17 Point Agreement.'' Even though it was forced upon the Tibetan government, it promised to preserve Tibetan political, cultural, and religious institutions, and so was warily accepted by the Tibetan government. \n",
      "   Mr. President, going back to the early days of the PRC, we can see a pattern. The terms on paper protected the Tibetan way of life. But the promises proved empty. I suggest this is a lesson our President today would be wise to learn. Whether regarding Hong Kong, weapons proliferation, or trade, we must remember what Ronald Reagan taught us--``trust, but verify.'' This is especially true of our dealings with communists and authoritarian rulers. \n",
      "   In Tibet, nine years of trying to compromise with the communists, from 1951 to 1959, failed. In fact, the restrictions on Tibet increased progressively, as did the oppression and brutality of Beijing's rule. \n",
      "   March 10, 1959 stands out as an important day, not only in Tibet's history, but also in the history of humanity's struggle for freedom. On this day, the people of Lhasa organized a permanent guard around the Dalai Lama's palace, and demanded the withdrawal of the Chinese from Tibet and the restoration of Tibet's independence. \n",
      "   One week later, the Dalai Lama was forced to flee his home and his people while his palace was being shelled by the PLA. It is important to note that, in a great and triumphant official act, he repudiated the 17-Point agreement. \n",
      "   According to Chinese statistics, 87,000 Tibetans were killed, arrested, or deported to labor camps during this ``Lhasa Revolt.'' Countless tried to follow the Dalai Lama to India--unfortunately, only a very small percentage of the thousands who attempted to escape through the Himalayas to India survived. If they could successfully avoid the Chinese military--then they would succumb to malnutrition, cold, and disease. \n",
      "   Mr. President, we are today honoring the memory of the more than 87,000 Tibetans who paid with their lives for the preservation of Tibet. We also honor the 6 million Tibetans today who keep alive the hope of one-day returning home. \n",
      "   Mr. President, we believe in certain inalienable rights; it is part of our constitution. I believe that our freedom cannot be complete, and we as a nation cannot achieve our fullest greatness, so long as others suffer from the yoke of tyranny and oppression. Tibet today suffers from cultural genocide at the hands of the PRC. And yet, don't they also have inalienable rights: to reject tyranny? to determine their political future including independence? to chose freedom and reject oppression? \n",
      "   The answer, very clearly, must be a resounding ``yes.'' We have introduced  this resolution today, to register this ``yes.'' We do it for His Holiness, the Dalai Lama of Tibet. We do it for the 6 million Tibetans in the world today facing the very real and unfortunate threat of seeing their homeland destroyed and culture obliterated. And, we do it for each of us who believe that the gifts we have in our lives here do not excuse us from caring about the struggles of others. \n",
      "   I am pleased to submit this resolution, and ask my colleagues to support its immediate adoption. \n",

      "   Mr. MACK. I thank the Senator for yielding. I will not use that much time. I thank the Senator for the leadership he has provided on this legislation. \n",
      "   It was really not my intention to speak on this bill because I was under the impression that this bill had great bipartisan support, that we would bring this to the floor after coming out of committee, and it would breeze through the Senate. This is a piece of legislation that is supposedly--supposedly--supported by everybody. \n",
      "   I am pleased to speak in favor of the Ed-Flex bill. Our children will thrive when State and local communities are given the freedom to craft their education plans according to the unique education needs of their children. Local schools do more when Washington bureaucracies do less. That is what this bill does. \n",
      "   We are beginning the second week of consideration of this bill. We have been forced to file three cloture motions on what may be the most popular, most bipartisan legislation we will consider this Congress. \n",
      "   I fear this may set the tone for the remainder of the 106th Congress, where consideration of any bill will be filibustered by the Democrats and drive partisanship to new heights. \n",
      "   As I implied a moment ago, I am in some ways confused by what is happening. I do not understand how a bill that supposedly is supported by an overwhelming number of Members on both sides of the aisle has been caught up in this constant and continuous effort to amend the bill. \n",
      "   I think the actions we have seen during this past week, and what we are anticipating through the balance of this week, raise the question about those who have cosponsored the bill and who say they are in support of it. I question whether they truly support the idea of Ed-Flex, which is to allow State and local communities to have more control over how dollars are spent. I think there is a ruse underway here. I think our colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to claim that they support the idea of giving local communities  and States more authority and more flexibility in how to spend their dollars, yet they come out here and offer amendment after amendment on this bill, knowing full well--and I ask the Senator from Tennessee if this is not the case--knowing full well the majority leader has said to them there will be other opportunities to offer these amendments on other education bills when they come forward. Is that an accurate statement? \n",

As I said a minute ago, I really am serious now in raising questions about the sincerity of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle who purport that they are in favor of Ed-Flex but, yet, want to bog this piece of legislation down with a whole series of amendments they know are controversial. \n",
      "   There is nothing wrong with us dealing with controversial amendments and controversial issues. We do that throughout our entire political careers. The question is the timing of it. The question is the approach. I am, again, dismayed by the attitude that is being projected here. I, again, question sincerity. \n",
      "   Recently, we went through a 5- or 6-week period at the beginning of this new Congress with a very contentious issue dealing with the impeachment trial. But each side made a sincere effort to work with the other, and as a result I think we did a credible job. I think most people in the country think we did a credible job. Yet, on this the second piece of legislation we are considering, we are being forced to offer cloture motion after cloture motion after cloture motion--three so far. There should be no question in anyone's mind that the intention here, I believe, is now to kill this piece of legislation because it goes against their political interests. It goes against their philosophy. \n",
      "   In all honesty, the differences in the approach about education in America is clear. Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are convinced the only way to improve education in America is to have a larger group of wiser bureaucrats in \n",
      "   Washington make a determination about how resources ought to be allocated and what regulations ought to come down from Washington in order to solve this problem. \n",
      "   We have a totally different view. We think if we give this money to the States and the local communities, they can make better decisions about what their top spending priority is. In some local school districts that is school buildings. In other school districts that is school books. In others, that is teachers. We ought to allow them to make those decisions. We should not stand in their way. \n",
      "   Again, I came here to raise these points with respect to the process, as much as anything else. I remind everyone that, in the last Congress, there were 69 cloture motions that were filed--69 cloture motions. And here we are again battling along party lines about a bill that we were told might pass with 100 votes. I have serious reservations now whether that is going to happen. I think the actions of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are very clear. They are now trying to kill the idea of allowing States and local communities to have more flexibility. \n",
      "   Again, I appreciate the work and the effort of the Senator from Tennessee on this issue. He has provided great leadership and I appreciate the opportunity and the time he has given me. \n",

      "    Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for Senate Resolution 57 condemning the Cuban government's human rights record and calling on the President to make all efforts necessary to pass a resolution condemning Cuba at the UN Human Rights Commission meeting in Geneva, Switzerland. \n",
      "   Many people have written and spoken about the latest crackdown in Cuba as if they were discovering for the first time the nature of Fidel Castro's brutal regime. Fidel Castro is a tyrant. He rules with absolute authority and uses fear and greed to maintain his power. For forty years he has demonstrated to us his nature. He has not changed. We must continue our pressure on him--voice our opposition to him. And we must continue our support for the struggling Cuban people. The choice should not be difficult to make: we must stand with those suffering under one of the few totalitarian Marxists remaining in power in the world, and we must stand up to condemn the actions of the brutal regime. \n",
      "   One clear reminder of who we are dealing with is the murder in the Florida straits of four Americans in 1996. They were flying a humanitarian mission when the Cuban Air Force shot their unarmed aircraft out of the sky. For three years, Mr. President, we have all known about this murder, and for three years, I have been struggling to understand why this administration refuses to take appropriate action. \n",
      "   The Boston Globe published a very powerful essay by columnist Jeff Jacoby to mark this anniversary. I'd like to read from it. Jeff captures the starkness of the mismatched foreign policy in place, comparing the act, which Fidel Castro committed with this administration's unprincipled response. His piece is titled ``Murder Over the High Seas.''  \n",
      "   They were trying to save lives. Three years ago this week, they paid with their own. \n",
      "   When Armando Alejandre, Carlos Costa, Mario de la Pena, and Pablo Morales took to the skies that day in their little blue-and-white Cessna 337s, their plan was to search the Florida Straits for stranded boat people, refugees fleeing Cuba in makeshift rafts or flimsy inner tubes. There was little enough the fliers could do for any rafters they came upon--toss down food and bottled water, radio their location to the Coast Guard--but that little could make the difference between life and death. \n",
      "   Of the four, Carlos was the most experienced. He had flown more than 500 such missions for Brothers to the Rescue, and had saved scores of boat people from drowning or dying of thirst. Armando, by contrast, was going up for only the second time. What all four had in common was a love of American liberty--and a profound concern for any Cubans so desperate to escape Fidel Castro's Caribbean hellspot that they would risk their lives to get away. \n",
      "   On Feb. 24, 1996, Carlos, Armando, Mario, and Pablo took off from an airfield in Opa-Locka, Fla. They intended to fly just below the 24th parallel, well north of Cuba's territorial waters. Both planes contacted Havana air-traffic controllers as they approached the 24th parallel, identifying themselves and giving their position. Whereupon the Cuban Air Force, without warning and without reason, scrambled two MiG fighters and blew the rescue planes out of the sky. \n",
      "   The Cessnas and their passengers were disintegrated by the Cuban MiGs. Only a large oil slick marked the spot where they went down. No bodies were ever recovered. \n",
      "   Three of the men--Carlos, Mario, and Armando--were US citizens. Pablo, a former refugee who had himself been saved by Brothers to the Rescue in 1992, was a permanent US resident. What happens when four American civilians are butchered in cold blood, over international waters, by the air force of a Third World dictatorship? What terrible retribution does the United States exact for a quadruple murder so barbaric and unprovoked? \n",
      "   The astonishing answer is: Nothing happens. There is no retribution. Indeed, the Clinton administration takes the position not only that Castro must not be punished for the four lives he destroyed, but that the victims' families must not be permitted to recover anything for their loss. \n",
      "   In the wake of the shootdown, under intense political pressure, President Clinton agreed to sign the Helms-Burton Act. Title III of the statute allows American citizens whose property was confiscated by the Cuban government--Castro nationalized billions of dollars' worth of American assets in the 1960s--to file suit against any foreign company using that property. Title IV bars any officer of a foreign company trafficking in stolen American property from receiving a visa to enter the United States. \n",
      "   Properly enforced, Helms-Burton would weaken Castro's grip on power by reducing the flow of foreign capital into his treasury. But Helms-Burton is not properly enforced. Title III has never taken effect because Clinton keeps suspending it (as the law permits him to do if he finds that a suspension ``will expedite a transition to democracy in Cuba''). Title IV has never taken effect because the State Department refuses to carry it out. \n",
      "   The hobbling of Helms-Burton is a stinging insult to the memory of the four murdered men. But the Clinton administration has delivered a cut unkinder still. \n",
      "   In 1996, the families of Armando, Carlos, and Mario sued the Cuban government for damages caused by the wrongful deaths of their loved ones, a legal remedy specifically authorized by the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act. In December 1997, Senior US District Judge James Lawrence King awarded the plaintiffs $187.7 million in damages. ``Cuba's extrajudicial killings ..... were inhumane acts against innocent civilians,'' he wrote in his final judgment. ``The fact that the killings were premeditated and intentional, outside Cuban territory, wholly  disproportionate, and executed without warning ..... makes this act unique in its brazen flouting of international norms.'' \n",
      "   But when the families attempted to collect their judgment out of frozen Cuban assets, the Clinton administration blocked them. The president famous for feeling people's pain is less concerned with the pain of grief-stricken Americans, it would appear, than with the pain Castro might feel if the judgment were paid. \n",
      "   The administration's position is staggering. Castro is an open and declared enemy of the United States and has been for 40 years. In sending combat aircraft to slaughter four unarmed Americans engaged in humanitarian rescue work, he committed an act of war. The response of the United States should have been to remove Castro from power and put him in the dock for crimes against humanity. (for the murder of just ``one'' American in 1989, the United States invaded Panama and seized Manuel Noriega.) \n",
      "   Clinton's appeasement of Castro is a cruel betrayal. The families of the dead Brothers of the Rescue deserve better from their government. And the tormented people of Cuba, bleeding under Castro's whip, deserve better from their free and powerful neighbor to the north.  \n",
      "   Mr. President, it is clear to me that the United States has failed to stand up for the protection of the individual when damaged by international terrorism. I spoke last week about this administration's failure to adequately address terrorism in the Middle East. The pattern remains consistent--appease the enemies of freedom, the advocates of terror, in the hopes that they will not strike again. This approach simply fails. I don't know how to say it any more directly that that. This approach fails. \n",
      "   The Congress passed a law last year supporting the awarding of damages from the frozen assets of terrorist states being held by the Treasury Department to American victims. This law can help the families of the Brothers to the Rescue pilots. The President, however, waived this relief asserting our national security interests would be better served by protecting Castro's money. How can this be? Nobody has provided to me an adequate explanation of what interest would cause us protect terrorism and shun American victims. \n",
      "   Mr. President, this resolution calls on the United States to stand up for freedom, justice, and human dignity. It states that the President of the United States should lead on this issue by having the United States introduce and make all efforts necessary to pass a resolution in Geneva condemning the human rights record of the Cuban government. Mr. President, if there is one time and one place where we are obliged to condemn human rights practices, it is at the UN Commission meeting in Geneva each year. That is what this resolution calls for, and I calls for its immediate passage.  \n",

      "   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to join with my distinguished colleagues, Senators CHAFEE, LIEBERMAN, and others, in introducing the Credit for Voluntary Early Action Act. This measure is an important first step towards reducing the regulatory uncertainty surrounding any possible regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. This bill will provided us a valuable platform for a thorough discussion of this important issue and I encourage all my colleagues to join us in our efforts. \n",
      "   In my state of Florida, we learned long ago that a healthy environment is fundamentally necessary for a healthy economy. This is evidenced by our congressional delegation's historic bipartisan consensus on such important national issues as the protection of the Florida Everglades and our efforts to stop oil and gas exploration off our beaches. The citizens of my state know full well how necessary it is we keep our environment clean and pristine. \n",
      "   I'm proud to stand with my colleagues here today and take Florida's common sense, market-based attitude on the environment to the national level. The legislation we're sponsoring today would encourage and reward voluntary actions businesses take to reduce the emission of potentially harmful greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide. \n",
      "   Under our bill, the President would be authorized to provide regulatory credit to companies who take early voluntary action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This credit could be used to comply with future regulatory  requirements and--in a market-based approach--traded or sold to other companies as they work to meet their own environmental obligations. \n",
      "   Participants in this innovative program would agree to annually measure, track and publicly report greenhouse gas emissions. Credit given would be one-for-one, based on actual reductions below an agreed-upon baseline. Credits issued under the program would be subtracted from total emissions allowed under future regulatory emissions requirements. \n",
      "   I believe this approach makes sense for many reasons. For one, there are many uncertainties surrounding the issue of greenhouse gas emissions and their relation to global warming. The complexities and uncertainties associated with understanding the interactions of our climate, our atmosphere and the impact of human behavior are enormous. I have my own concerns about the science behind this issue, and have tremendous concerns about the regulatory approach outlined in last year's Kyoto agreement. It is not my intent--in cosponsoring this bill--to validate Kyoto or the underlying science. Those issues are best left to the scientists and future congresses. Today, we are simply trying to clear the way for voluntary emissions-reductions projects that would otherwise be delayed for years. And we accomplish this in a way that is not costly to the taxpayers. \n",
      "   It makes sense to provide appropriate encouragement to businesses who want to invest in improved efficiency--those who want to find ways to make cars, factories and power production cleaner. Under our bill, these companies are encouraged--not based on government fiat or handout--to get credit for their own initiative and problem solving skills. \n",
      "   Another reason I believe this legislation would be beneficial is because today's businesses have no control over the regulations that could be required of them down the road. Although today's Congress has no desire to legislate requirements on greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, it is extremely difficult to predict where the scientific and economic data will carry future policymakers. In my view, it makes sense to encourage businesses to be proactive in protecting themselves from any future restrictions enacted by a more regulatory-minded Congress and administration. \n",
      "   Mr. President, all of us agree that a healthy environment is important to our future. It's time to put partisanship aside and solve our environmental problem in a way that will allow business to be in control of their own future while doing their part to address global warming. By allowing companies to earn credit for actions they take now, businesses can be prepared for any regulations in the future. \n",
      "   I look forward to beginning an earnest debate about this issue with my colleagues in the United States Senate. I believe we have an innovative approach to confronting as issue fraught with uncertainties. We should be looking to solve more of our problems by using our free market philosophy rather than by costly Washington mandates that my not work. The Credit for Voluntary Early Reductions Act is responsible effort to validate on the national level what we've always known in Florida: a healthy environment is key to a healthy economy. \n",

      "   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I very recently traveled to Israel. It had been several years since my last visit, and I expected this year we would bring some  important measures to the Senate floor. The timeline on the Oslo accords expires in May, and Arafat has threatened to unilaterally declare an independent state. The supplemental appropriations for the Wye River accords will soon be before us, and the timetable on the Jerusalem Embassy Act requires that the President report to the Congress why the United States Embassy has not been set up in Israel's capital city, Jerusalem. I learned a great deal during the week and I rise today to share a few simple thoughts regarding what I saw and what went through my mind as the week in Israel unfolded. \n",
      "   Let me begin with the question that is on my mind today: How is it possible to engage in peace negotiations with people who maintain the right to obliterate you, who are filled with hatred toward you, and who harbor the dream of one day destroying your homeland? Peace is a matter of the heart. I believe in the depths of every person's heart is a desire to live in peace. But what I saw, which was the outcome of the Palestinian Authority rule, convinced me that their hearts and minds are set on other goals. The Palestinian leadership does not want peace. They want, first, their own state which they can control with total power. Then they want to use that state to eliminate the State of Israel. \n",
      "   Let's be clear. The peace process, to be meaningful, must be about more than rules and laws and lines on a map. We can reach a short-term agreement on these points, but if the Palestinian leadership fails to abandon incitement of hatred, persecution, and terrorism, then we are all dreaming, only dreaming, and our President's behavior must be labeled foolish appeasement. There will not be peace until hearts and minds are changed, and we must focus our attention on these issues. \n",
      "   Mr. President, many of my colleagues in the Senate and in the House are aware of the promotion of hatred contained in the Palestinian media, and more significantly in the Palestinian schoolbooks. Let me provide some examples. \n",
      "   This is a picture that was taken off of Palestinian Authority-controlled television. It is a picture of a young girl, probably 6 or 7 years old. This is a young girl singing into a microphone. She is on a television show that would be what we would refer to as kind of a Mickey Mouse Club type of show that would be shown to children by the Palestinian Authority. I want to read to you what this little girl is singing. Again, this is a program that was produced by the people who are sitting across the table from you, supposedly negotiating peace. This is what the little girl is singing:  \n",
      "   When I wander into the entrance of Jerusalem, \n",
      "   I'll turn into a suicide warrior in battledress, \n",
      "   In battledress. In battledress.  \n",
      "   There is no way I can convey to you the emotion of actually seeing that scene on television. There is no way I can put the emotion into what she was expressing and the emotion that she was expressing as she sang those words. And after her song, she got an ovation from her classmates and from her teacher. \n",
      "   This focuses us on the fundamental difference in approach between the Palestinians and the Israelis. I have a grandson about that age, about the age of that little girl. How would I feel if he were being taught hatred in school? If he were being taught hatred on television, how would I feel? How would you feel if your Government was teaching your children to hate? Could you conclude that they were serious about long-term peace with their neighbors? \n",
      "   I also have some examples from Palestinian textbooks for a third-grade grammar lesson. Here is the task: ``Complete the following blank spaces with the appropriate word.'' And the sentence is, ``The Zionist enemy blank civilians with its aircraft.'' The correct answer is, ``The Zionist enemy attacked civilians with its aircraft.'' \n",
      "   For seventh graders: ``Answer the following question: Why do the Jews hate Muslim unity and want to cause division among them? Give an example of the evil attempts of the Jews, from events happening today.'' These are from Palestinian textbooks today. \n",
      "   One would expect, rather than focus on hatred, if they were serious about peace, they would focus on how the two peoples are working to live side by side. A history book for 12th graders published only last summer teaches: ``The clearest examples of racist belief and racial discrimination in the world are Nazism and Zionism.'' \n",
      "   To see this taking place today is chilling. If you can, think about it in the context of being in Israel and being briefed by a member of the Government with respect to what is happening in what they refer to as the anti-incitement committee, which was set up by the Wye Agreement. To be sitting there and seeing this, I must say to you, was chilling. I found it to be extremely chilling. \n",
      "   While the Government of Israel makes good-faith efforts to come to a peace agreement, the Palestinian Authority teaches children hatred. This causes me to ask, How can peace be obtained when the children are being taught hatred? \n",
      "   Let me share another story. I attended Shabbat dinner at the home of Saul and Wendy Singer in Jerusalem. Saul worked on my staff for 7 years before moving with his wife to Israel. They just had their second child, a girl named Tamar. Wendy told the story of the day she was checking out of the hospital in Jerusalem, 2 days after giving birth. In a very ordinary and matter of fact way, the hospital gave her the necessities for bringing home a newborn baby. In addition to providing for diapers and other things we would expect, she was handed a gas mask for her baby. It is actually a tent which you put your baby under in case of a chemical weapons attack. \n",
      "   In Israel, this preparation is routine. Everyone in Israel knows to have a gas mask ready. It just becomes a part of the craziness of everyday life. But when you bring home a newborn baby, when you bring home your baby and you get the chemical weapons tent at the hospital, then you realize how unordinary life is in Israel today. You realize that you are really simply struggling for a normal life, hoping for peace and security, praying to God, while actually living in a war zone. \n",
      "   I had another profound meeting during this week. I met one evening privately--secretly--with Arabs who were being persecuted for their Christian faith. I met with about 10 Palestinian Christians. I will tell you just one of their stories, but I will change some of the details to protect the person I am describing. \n",
      "   I remember an energetic man, in his early 40s, at the end of the table. I remember him because he seemed so full of life and love. He had a great smile on his face and displayed a wonderful sense of humor. I say this was memorable because, frankly, after hearing what he had been through, I do not know if I could express the sense of peace and love he did. This is his story. \n",
      "   He had many children and very little money. He converted to Christianity in 1993. He clearly loved God, and he loved to tell people about his conversion. He described to me how in 1997, the Palestinian Authority asked him to come to the police station for questioning. When he arrived, he was immediately arrested and detained on charges of selling land to Jews. He denied this charge, since he was very poor and owned no land. He was beaten. He was hung from the ceiling by his hands for many hours. He showed me what I just said. He showed me how his hands were tied behind his back and then raised from the floor and hung that way for many, many hours. \n",
      "   After 2 weeks, he was transferred to a larger prison where he was held for 8 months without trial. He was released in February 1998, after his family borrowed thousands of dollars to pay off the local authorities. And even though he is free, they are keeping his father in prison. They believe it is for his son's beliefs. He feels his father is being held hostage to prevent him from talking with people about his faith. Needless to say, these Christians met with me at considerable risk. They conveyed to me a message of fear and desperation. But their mere presence in the room with me demonstrated their hope, and it also caused me to ask, how can the people of Israel find peace with the Palestinian Authority while the Palestinian Authority engages in coercion and torture based upon religious beliefs? \n",
      "   I also met with the parents of American children killed by Palestinian terrorists. In this meeting, I was struck by the courage displayed by these families after suffering the tremendous loss  of a child brutally murdered. These families told me of the hopes and dreams they had for their children. I couldn't help thinking about my own. My daughter, Debbie, traveled with me on this trip. She was in the room as these stories of brutality and murder were related. There was scarcely a dry eye in the room. \n",
      "   I am sure Debbie was thinking about her three little boys, ages 14, 11 and 5. We were moved by the comments made by the parents as they described to us what had happened. \n",
      "   I understand that the Palestinian Authority knows a great deal about these murderers, but they are not being punished. Some of them have gone to trial and were sentenced, but we don't know if they remain in prison. I was told that we know some have been released. \n",
      "   There are reports that the Palestinian Authority allows them to leave prison each day and return in the evening--like free room and board more than like prison. I was also presented with stories of the lionization of these murderers in the press and again in the classrooms. Try to imagine how you would feel, try to imagine what would be going through your mind when you are dealing with the grief of the loss of your child. You know who is responsible. You know they know who is responsible. You saw them go on trial. You saw them then released. You have to ask yourself, what are we going through this peace process for? \n",
      "   I would like to mention one story of many that I heard. Mrs. Dosberg sat directly across the table from me. When she told us of the loss of her daughter and son-in-law, the lesson of these murders became so clear--we must fight terror and we cannot back off. Mrs. Dosberg's family, her daughter, American son-in-law, and their 9-month-old daughter attended a wedding in central Israel on June 9, 1996. They decided not to bring their 2-year-old daughter along. Thank God. On the way home from the wedding they were stopped by Palestinian terrorists and killed in a so-called drive-by shooting. Fifty bullets were found to have been used in this murder, and yet, by some miracle, the baby survived. Even with a crime this gross, the Palestinian Authority did not arrest \n",
      "   everyone involved or suspected in the shooting. One of those who remained free, it is believed, later took part in the bombing of the Apropos Cafe, killing many others. \n",
      "   Another suspected killer, according to the Israeli Justice Ministry, was under arrest but given permission to come and go as he pleases from prison. \n",
      "   Mohammed Dief, another suspected Palestinian terrorist, took part in the murder of two other Americans, at two different times, according to the mothers with whom I spoke. Mrs. Sharon Weinstock lost her 19-year-old son in a drive-by shooting masterminded by Dief. And only a year later, Mrs. Wachsman told me of the kidnap-murder of their son, also believed to have been planned by Dief. \n",
      "   I am told Mohammed Dief remains a free man today. The obvious lesson--terrorists kill and those who are not jailed remain free to kill and to kill again thanks to the Palestinian Authority. \n",
      "   How would I feel in their place? I couldn't keep the thought from my mind, as I listened. If I had lost a child and knew that the murderer or accomplices were on the loose, how would I feel? And if I knew the killer remained free to kill other people's children, how would I feel? It is so hard, hard to even consider, but I do know that I left there committed to doing whatever I could to help each of those families. \n",
      "   Once again, I began to better understand the way the Palestinian Authority leadership was approaching peace. How can one find peace with people who do not condemn terrorism? Mr. President, how is it possible to engage in peace negotiations with people who want to teach their children to die in a holy war against you? How is it possible to engage in peace negotiations with people who persecute those of other faiths? How is it possible to engage in peace negotiations with people who keep terrorists on the loose to wreak havoc and evil against you and praise them for heroism? \n",
      "   Today the Israeli people are exhausted by 50 years of violence against their homes and families, of sending their sons and daughters into the army, and they dream of a promised peace now. This is our hope and our dream as well. But we must not get confused. History is replete with examples of compromises which bring terror and destroy dreams. \n",
      "   In the United States, many people seem to think that if we do not confront these obstacles to peace and if we look the other way, then we will be able to come to an agreement. The reality, however, is just the opposite. If we do not acknowledge the attitudes and acts of those at the peace table, then the peace process is already over, and we just won't admit it. \n",
      "   In other words, the surest way to kill the peace process is to avoid confrontation, to fear upsetting a belligerent force and to avoid addressing incitement, violence, persecution and terrorism. The only way to keep the peace process alive is to focus on truth, freedom, security and justice. \n",
      "   Israeli efforts, to date, have sought to keep the peace process alive, improve security during the negotiating process, and obtain reciprocity as a vital element of implementation. \n",
      "   The process remains alive, but terrorism continues and is exalted by many in the Palestinian Authority, and reciprocity does not exist. The United States role has been to seek the middle ground. Unfortunately, this only rewards those willing to go to new extremes. \n",
      "   The middle ground between Prime Minister Netanyahu and Chairman Arafat is not halfway between the two. The United States must not engage in moral equivocation. We must not shy away from holding Arafat responsible for acts of violence, incitement and persecution. \n",
      "   The United States must demonstrate principled leadership and end the appeasement that perpetuates the cycle of violence. The peace process can only work when leaders uphold their agreements and answer to the people, and the United States remains a vigilant defender of the principles which bind us to Israel: freedom, democracy, and the rule of law. \n",
      "   What should we do? I believe there are three things. First, we should insist upon the strict adherence to Oslo and the reciprocity codified at Wye. The purpose of the Wye accord was at long last to force the Palestinians to comply with commitments before further territory would be turned over. \n",
      "   So at Wye, Israel agreed only to turn over territory in phases, in which it could verify Palestinian compliance at each and every step. In the first phase, Israel completed its redeployment after the Palestinian Authority completed its tasks. In phase 2, the Palestinians did not meet all their obligations and, therefore, Israel has not yet turned over the additional land. Reciprocity makes no sense unless it is based upon this formulation. Once Israel has ceded territory, it is unlikely it ever could recover it. The Palestinians, on the other hand, can turn on and off their promises. In fact, this is exactly what they have done. \n",
      "   Second, we should stop paying Arafat. Any funds provided to the Palestinian people should continue to go through private voluntary organizations. We should also monitor much more closely the rampant corruption and mismanagement of funds provided currently. \n",
      "   And third, we must aggressively seek the bringing to justice of Palestinian terrorists who killed American citizens. I am told that our Justice Department can do a better job here, that they have a great deal of information on the murderers of the Americans who are free in the Palestinian areas and, indeed, can make some requests for indictments. It is time to do this. Let's put the needs of the American families and other victims' families over the needs of those engaging in or supporting terrorism. \n",
      "   Mr. President, these are very basic principles. I am not discussing today the intricacies of the peace process, U.S. funding, embassies, or any other number of issues we will be discussing this year in the Senate. We need to focus on a more fundamental level first. And I hope that this message will be heard at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. \n",
      "   What I mean when I say this is that I hope the President will hear the message. I say this from a standpoint not of arrogance, not of confrontation, and I do not mean it in a political way. I just hope that the President will listen  and take another look at what he and his foreign policy team are trying to force the Israeli Government to do. \n",
      "   There cannot be peace until there is a change of heart. I returned from this trip with a newfound concern for the future of Israel. I saw examples of incitement. I heard examples of persecution and hatred being taught throughout Palestinian society by their leaders. When the people engaged in peace talks return from the negotiating table only to disparage compromise and incite violence, there can be no progress towards peace. \n",
      "   Israel has come a long way since I first began following the fate of this state and the people of Israel. In so many respects, life appears and feels normal. The economy is developing, the standard of living is growing and improving. But just below the surface of this normalcy, Mr. President, Israel still faces a threat to the state's very existence. Israel's survival remains, unfortunately, a very real and central concern 50 years after its independence. \n",
      "   Some people believe, however, that by ignoring this threat, that the peace process can succeed. Mr. President, it will fail. It is clear to me that many in the Palestinian leadership today see the peace process toward the goal of eliminating the State of Israel. \n",
      "   I suggest today that we get back to the basics. Peace is not possible while teaching children to hate and kill. Peace is not possible while persecuting those of other faiths. Peace is not possible while lionizing terrorism. We must stand up for freedom, security, and human dignity. We must stand up to ensure the security of Israel. We must stand up in the Congress, and we must insist that our President stand with us. \n",
      "   Today is the day to end American pressure on Israel to force a peace agreement. Today is the day to remember it is up to the people of Israel to determine their own fate--their own security. We should pressure those who fill children with slogans of hatred and holy war; we should pressure them to change. We should pressure those who torture; we should pressure them to change. We should pressure those who encourage and support terror and murder, and those who rejoice in hatred. That is where the pressure should be. \n",
      "   Now is the time, Mr. President, for a return to our principled stand. The only way to truly attain peace is to support freedom, democracy and justice, and oppose the cycle of hatred. We must face tyranny and oppression where it exists, condemn it, and stand up for peace--real peace based upon security, freedom, and a change of heart. \n",

      "   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, if there is ever a time and place to raise human rights concerns, it is at the annual meeting of the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva, Switzerland. That Commission is meeting right now. And I rise today to urge my fellow Senators to join with me and the 17 other cosponsors of this resolution to make a simple statement. We disapprove of the human rights abuses occurring in China and in Tibet. \n",
      "   Since last year, when we passed this resolution with 95 votes, the President has engaged in two summits with Chinese President Jiang. During that time, many promises were made and agreements were concluded, and the United States did not introduce a human rights resolution in Geneva. \n",
      "   We were told the United States would make progress by not introducing a resolution. And Wei Jingsheng, a prominent dissident, was released. Tomorrow, Mr. Wei will be here in Washington, DC, and he will urge the United States not to make the same mistake as last year. Mr. President, we must now make this statement of condemnation of China's human rights practices. \n",
      "   We received many promises from the Chinese Government last year as well. But we know that the human rights conditions have only deteriorated. The State Department's human rights report clearly delineates the atrocities occurring in China and Tibet. And we know from press accounts that the crackdown on human rights and political activists has hardened. \n",
      "   It is unconscionable that the United States would not take a stand against these blatant atrocities, especially when they are documented by our own State Department. By remaining \n",
      "   silent, we do a great injustice to those fighting for freedom, democracy, and the rule of law inside China and Tibet. \n",
      "   Mr. President, I want to quote from a statement made by Mr. Wei not long after he was released and exiled from his country. And this is what he said:  \n",
      "   Democracy and freedom are among the loftiest ideals of humanity, and they are the most sacred rights of mankind. Those who already enjoy democracy, liberty and human rights, in particular, should not allow their own personal happiness to numb them into forgetting the many others who are still struggling against tyranny, slavery and poverty, and all of those who are suffering from unimaginable forms of oppression, exploitation and massacres.  \n",
      "   Mr. President, this is an easy one. It does not matter whether the world votes with us or against us or abstains in Geneva. It does not even matter if this resolution will change the minds of anyone in Beijing. We do know, however, from the firsthand testimony of released dissidents, that the actions of the United States are important to those engaged in the struggle for freedom. We know from those released that by simply making this statement we demonstrate our solidarity with those who are engaged within the daily struggle for freedom, justice, and the respect for human dignity. \n",

      "   Mr. MACK. Mr. Chief Justice, today the Senate finds itself at an unlikely crossroads in American history. We have assembled as a court of impeachment to sit in judgement of our President, William Jefferson Clinton, on the charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. We have worked our will in this matter according to a process rooted in English common law, written by our Founders into the Constitution, and exercised against the Chief Executive only once before in American history. \n",
      "   This is not a task to be taken lightly, and we have not arrived easily at our decision. The Senate today is engaged in weighty struggles that go to the very heart of our private and public lives. We are at an unlikely juncture between principle and public opinion, repentance and the rule of law, perception and punishment, forgiveness and findings of fact. These are difficult issues, Mr. Chief Justice. We approach our task fully aware that our decisions today will reverberate across this great land and throughout the length and breadth of history. \n",
      "   There has been much discussion about how we got here. And while the answer to that question may be varied in all its permutations, then amplified in the echo-chamber that is our modern public debate, it can be said with assurance that this whole unseemly business began when the President, caught in an improper private act, took deliberate steps to conceal it. And for all the other parties blamed for our presence here today--the media, the independent counsel, the political factions opposed to the President, the House of Representatives--it must be clearly understood that this process began with the deliberate and wilful acts of the President of the United States to lie in a Supreme Court sanctioned civil rights inquiry and obstruct the due course of justice. It all started with the high-handed disregard for the law exhibited by the nation's Chief Executive. It ends today. \n",
      "   Mr. Chief Justice, when the sound and fury of the moment has passed, and this episode can be observed with the objectivity that comes with the passage of time, I believe it will be self-evident that we have followed the Constitution to the best of our abilities. In a free, democratic society such as ours, the foundation of freedom is an independent judiciary, the rule of law, and most importantly the Constitution. Our Constitution is the framework for American society, and I have been constantly reminded throughout these proceedings of the importance of our duty to honor the dignity of this document. \n",
      "   The magnitude of this undertaking deserves no less than a sincerity of purpose and an absolute confidence in the wisdom of our Founders. The American people should not be swayed by those who argue the prominence of this case--in all its tawdry and unseemly detail--has made unnecessary a thorough process of determining the truth. We stand in judgement of the President. Our decisions will be remembered throughout history. Our precedent may be followed by future Senates. Yet, still we have heard throughout this exercise the unfortunate call to end these proceedings, save a few weeks, and inject the politics of expediency into a monumental Constitutional undertaking. I find these arguments display a remarkable lack of confidence in the  sound and just system outlined by our Founders to address very serious charges levied against the President of the United States. \n",
      "   I am grateful the Senate rejected those calls and put in place a responsible mechanism for the thorough airing of fact and argument. I am confident our process during this trial, though far from perfect, was appropriate. We allowed time for detailed presentations on the part of the House of Representatives and the President. We held an extensive question-and-answer session to review and clarify matters presented by both sides. And we have allowed for the appropriate and necessary deposition of key witnesses. Unfortunately, the simple fact is that the outcome of this matter was, in many minds, predetermined. In spite of this, the integrity of the process was, time and again, fought for and protected. Now--today-- it only remains for us to cast our votes. \n",
      "   BACKGROUND \n",
      "   I wish to address my remarks not so much to the people listening in this room today, but rather to those future generations who will look back at the record and transcripts for guidance, direction, and a more thorough understanding of the process that played out in this chamber during the first two months of 1999. I mentioned earlier the significance of the Constitution. I cannot stress enough the essential role that this historical document has played in the trial of William Jefferson Clinton. This document laid the framework for what has taken place. Be it understood, the Senate tried the President because the Constitution requires that we do so. There is no exception for popular Presidents, such as William Jefferson Clinton. The Constitution provides for this process to be applied to everyone evenhandedly. \n",
      "   Although the trial of this President was not a trial in the traditional sense, it is important to note that if the impeachment of a President presents itself again, there is nothing restricting a more traditional trial from occurring. In fact, I would encourage future Senates to utilize a judicial proceeding more closely aligned to a typical courtroom trial. Every impeachment trial will have its own dynamic environment, determined by the political and social context in which it occurs. The \n",
      "   trial of William Jefferson Clinton occurred in a prosperous time. The citizens of this nation are largely satisfied, the President enjoys consistently high approval ratings, and the economy is outstanding. Impeaching and then trying the President has not engendered popular public support. I make these observations for future generations who reflect on this process simply to explain the mood of our nation and the political environment in which this proceeding occurred. As a result, we should not deceive ourselves into believing that public opinion did not impact this process. I would like to believe, however, that the competing demands of expediting the process versus honoring our Constitutional duties created a struggle that produced the most fair trial possible under the circumstances. Accordingly, the process we followed and the rules complied with may not be appropriate for the next trial. The decisions made in this environment should not be considered to set precedent that is inflexible. In fact, the precedent we set deserves thoughtful consideration and reasoned critique when reflected upon in the years and decades to come. \n",
      "   In that light, our official duties in this matter began on December 19, 1998, when the United States House of Representatives impeached the President, William Jefferson Clinton. After listening to the evidence, reading the trial memorandums and the record, and carefully considering the arguments presented by both the House Managers and White House counsel, I believe the President is guilty of both articles. \n",
      "   Before I address the merits of the case against the President, I think it is necessary to discuss whether the crimes of perjury and obstruction of justice constitute high crimes and misdemeanors as contemplated by the Framers of our Constitution. This topic has been the subject of much controversy in the past months. \n",
      "   It is true that private acts are the genesis of the matter before us. Had the acts stayed private, we would not be here today. The President, however, brought these private acts under our public purview and created a matter of public concern when he used his position and his power to deny and obstruct the civil rights of Paula Jones. \n",
      "   Contrary to what has been asserted, this is not just a case about a sexual encounter between the President and a young White House intern. This instead is a case about depriving Paula Jones, an individual who sought and was granted the right to file a civil rights action against the President, of her constitutional right to a day in court, a right which nine justices of the Supreme Court unanimously decided that she deserved. And--almost unbelievably--on the heels of this Supreme Court mandate, the President seemed to strengthen his efforts to deny Paula Jones' civil rights. Once these acts moved into the public arena, forming the basis for charges as serious as perjury and obstruction of justice, it is my opinion these acts became high crimes and misdemeanors as envisioned by our Founders. While our only precedent involves the impeachments of federal judges, I am satisfied the standards used in these cases also apply to the charges levied against the President. \n",
      "   The President of the United States is the head of the Executive Branch and the Chief Law Enforcement Officer of this nation. When the Founding Fathers established our tripartite system of government, it was decided that the three branches of government would operate as checks and balances on one another. As a result, no branch would be more powerful than the other. This structure is at the very core of our success as a Republic. \n",
      "   By obstructing justice and lying under oath, William Jefferson Clinton violated his duty as Chief Law Enforcement Officer, disrespected the Judicial Branch of the government, and undermined the foundations of our judicial system's truth-seeking process. If I were to determine that the President's actions did not constitute high crimes and misdemeanors, I would be asserting that the Executive Branch and the Office of the Presidency are more important than the Judicial Branch, and that the President of the United States is not obligated to abide by the rule of law. As a citizen and as a Senator, I cannot, in good faith, ignore the separation of powers argument. In my view, the President's conduct was in violation of the rule of law and his actions have betrayed the trust of the people of the United States. It is my firm belief that the serious offenses committed by William Jefferson Clinton are high crimes and misdemeanors and warrant impeachment, conviction, and removal from office. \n",
      "   Amazingly, we continue to hear the argument that although the President's actions rise to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors, he should not be removed from office. The Constitution provides if a President is found guilty of high crimes, then he is automatically removed from office. Our Constitution does not allow for finding the President guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors, and then permitting him to stay in office. Only an amendment to the Constitution would make such a step permissible. \n",
      "   There were several points during the trial of the President when I had a visceral reaction to certain charges raised by the House Managers. This reaction occurred, each time, at precisely the point when the Managers discussed the President's strategy to attack the character of Monica Lewinsky, Kathleen Willey and others. The callous disregard for the soul of another human being and the unsympathetic wounding of the character of another carried out by the President using the apparatus of the Presidency is chilling and deserves condemnation by \n",

      "   Before I proceed to my view of the specific articles, it may help to explain that I approach this process unencumbered by a law degree. While that in no way gives me license to disregard the legal aspects of the matter before me, it does permit me to translate legal concepts into layman's terms. As I worked my way through the voluminous record and sat through days of the trial, I found it easiest to understand this case if I approached it in chronological order. Given that, I will discuss the Obstruction of Justice count first, because in the course of this tragic series of events, I believe the President started down this slippery slope by the actions he took, as  opposed to the words he spoke. Sadly, the words, uttered under an oath to tell the truth, came later. \n",

      "    Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 346, a bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to prohibit the recoupment of funds recovered by states from one or more tobacco manufacturers. Starting in 1989, several states filed lawsuits against tobacco companies to recover the costs of smoking related illnesses borne by states. The lawsuits led to final settlements between each state and the tobacco industry. \n",
      "   Now, after providing no assistance to states in their legal battles, the Administration, through the Health Care Financing Administration, is attempting to claim a portion of this money. It is my opinion that this money belongs to the individual states, and should be spent as each state sees fit. This legislation accomplishes exactly that goal. \n",
      "   The Health Care Financing Administration's pursuit of these monies also could jeopardize state programs all over the country. In Florida, Governor Jeb Bush announced an endowment, funded by tobacco monies, to insure the financial health of vital programs for children and seniors. The endowment fund is named in honor of the late Governor Lawton Chiles, who played a key role in obtaining the tobacco settlement for the people of Florida. Other programs, funded by the settlement, have already been put in place in Florida, and would be jeopardized if the funds were suddenly not available. \n",
      "   Additionally, the Health Care Financing Administration's plan to obtain these funds by witholding federal Medicaid payments to the states could very well affect the states' ability to provide much needed care for the millions of Americans who depend on Medicaid. \n",
      "   The Administration's attempt to dictate how the money should be spent demonstrates a disregard for state budgeting process. I hope that my colleagues will support this bi-partisan bill that protects state tobacco settlements from federal recoupment.  \n",

This language is not intended to affect the public's ability to participate and comment on the development of project implementation reports, project cooperation agreements, operating manuals, and any other documents relating to the development, implementation, and management of individual features of the plan. In addition, this language is not intended to expand any one federal agency's authority. I share your view that the Corps' open process is one of the most important aspects in building the consensus which makes this Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan strong. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20001027\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Madam President, last year the Commerce, Justice, State and Judiciary Appropriations Subcommittee included funding for the Southern Florida Medical Corrections Options Program, which began operations this spring. Working with the Broward County Mental Health Court and the Broward County Sheriff's office it has had tremendous success in treating mentally ill misdemeanants and preventing recidivism. My colleague from Hawaii shares my interest in the program because Hawaii faces many of the same challenges as Florida in treating mentally ill misdemeanants. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-20001027\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. The Fiscal Year 2001 Commerce, State, Justice and the Judiciary Appropriations Committee Report includes a number of programs that the committee has encouraged the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) to examine and fund, if possible, under the Edward Byrne Memorial Discretionary Grants Program. I am hopeful that the BJA will consider funding for the joint Hawaii/Florida demonstration project to develop a national model for future mental health courts. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-3-20001027\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I thank the Chairman for his comments. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20001025\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I would like to engage Senator MCCONNELL, Chairman of the Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee in a colloquy regarding an important project addressed in both the Senate and House Committee Reports. This project is the Cuban Transition Project located in Miami, FL. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-20001025\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, my purpose for entering into this colloquy is to seek clarification from the Chairman regarding the Conferees' intent to support the Cuban Transition Project. The House Committee Report states that it supports $3.5 million be provided through USAID for this important initiative to provide policy makers, analysts and others with accurate information and practical policy recommendations that will be needed over a multi-year basis to assist this country in preparation for our next stage of interaction with the Cuban community and nation. The Senate Committee Report similarly supported this project, and it is my understanding that you support this project and intend that it receive support from USAID. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-3-20001025\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I thank the Chairman for reiterating his support and clarifying the intent of the subcommittee. This project has the strong support of the Chairman of the House International Relations Committee, and I know that this committee will also be expressing support to the agency. I would like to ask if you will be willing to further advise the Agency formally of your position on this matter. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-4-20001025\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I thank the Chairman for his comments. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20001019\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I would like to engage my colleague, Senator BOND, and Chairman of the Senate VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee in a brief colloquy concerning a provision in the conference agreement relating to the definition of ``urban county'' under federal housing law. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-20001019\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, as the Chairman knows, the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program statutory provisions relating to the ``urban county'' classification do not contemplate the form of consolidated city/county government found in Duval County, Florida (Jacksonville) where there is no unincorporated area. A recent decision by the Bureau of the Census, and subsequently by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), has questioned the status of Jacksonville/Duval County as an entitlement area. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-3-20001019\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, my purpose for entering into this colloquy is to seek clarification from the Chairman about the effect of the provision adopted by the Conference Committee to amend the definition of ``urban county'' to address this problem facing Jacksonville. \\n   Is it the Chairman's understanding that section 217 of the VA-HUD Conference Report addresses the concerns of the Town of Baldwin, Jacksonville and the Beaches communities, by amending current law to classify Jacksonville as an ``urban county''. Is it further his understanding that the language would preserve the area's longstanding status as an entitlement area for CDBG grants, while also allowing the Town of Baldwin to elect to have its population excluded from the entitlement area? \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-4-20001019\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I thank the Chairman for his comments.  \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20001012\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, the United States commitment to Israel is strong. It has stood the test of time, and has only strengthened. It is strong because it is grounded in our shared principles of freedom and democracy. It is also strong because we respect and appreciate Israel's commitment to preserve and protect those religious sites considered by all people of the world to be holy. \\n   I am very disturbed over recent events in the Middle East. America's response to Israel must be clear and reflect our total support. What we are witnessing is not, as it is often called, an ``outbreak of violence.'' What we are witnessing is a concerted attack against Israel; and this is occurring on the heels of the Israeli government taking the most conciliatory stance ever toward the Palestinians. \\n   After the Camp David summit, President Clinton correctly blamed Palestinian Authority Chairman Yassir Arafat for rejecting the compromises that Israel was willing to consider. Since Camp David, Arafat has compounded his rejection of peace proposals with an embrace of violence. The United States must maintain its pressure on Arafat and the Palestinian leadership, and avoid retreating into the moral swamp of ``evenhandedness.'' We must stand with Israel. \\n   I am deeply disappointed in the shameful U.S. abstention on a UN Security Council resolution that our own ambassador called ``unbalanced, biased, and really a lousy piece of work.'' \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-20001012\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, we must speak the truth and stand on principle, so that Arafat cannot continue blaming Israel for the completely unjustified attack that he \\n   initiated. There is a word for a policy of rewarding violence, and that word is ``appeasement.'' \\n   Appeasement is not just wrong; it also does not work. Events of recent days have led many Israelis to conclude that their government's generosity toward the Palestinians has--far from being reciprocated--been taken as weakness and invited the beating of war drums against Israel throughout the Arab world. \\n   As Israel begins to rethink its course, the United States must not push Israel towards appeasement. We must help Israel find the strength to stand up to aggression and continue the principled fight for justice. \\n   As citizens of a democracy that desperately wants peace, Israelis are as pained as anyone by the heart-wrenching pictures of Palestinian children caught in the crossfire. Israel can be counted on to search its soul as to whether she could have defended herself and claimed fewer Palestinian casualties. The result of such an inquiry, however, will not shift the overarching burden of responsibility from the party that chose to abandon the negotiating table and open a shooting war--Palestinian leader Yassir Arafat. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20001011\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, as an original sponsor of the Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act, I wish to make clear that the reference to June 7, 1999 in the anti-terrorism section of H.R. 3244 is intended to refer to the case of Thomas M. Sutherland. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20001011\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I thank Senator LAUTENBERG for making a point with which I strongly agree: the waiver authority in this legislation is intended to be used on each case or for each asset, but not to be used as a de-facto veto. \\n   In drafting this language and negotiating with the administration over the past several months, we believe firmly that using blocked assets of terrorist states to satisfy judgments is completely consistent with the intent of the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1996, and more significantly, is consistent with our national security interest. Simply stated, making the terrorists who harm or kill Americans in acts of international terrorism pay for their acts makes for good policy. It should deter future acts of terrorism, as well as provide some small measure of justice to current victims. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20001005\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I object. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20001005\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, as my colleagues know, I will be leaving the Senate at the end of my term. I want to put a few thoughts on the record over the next few days, depending on the time available. \\n   I have four grandchildren--three grandsons and one granddaughter--Ronnie Elam, Brett Elam, Blake Caldwell, and Addison McGillicuddy. The comments I am going to make today really are from the perspective of thinking about them and their future and the desire to see that they will grow up in a country and in a world where their opportunities will be equal to, if not better than, those of their parents, their grandparents, and their great-grandparents. I want them to have a better understanding when they reach that point when they have their own families. \\n   As people look back on the last several decades of the 20th century, I want, at least from my perspective, to be able to put on the record what I believe happened from both an economic and foreign policy perspective, and from a national security perspective. So that is what my comments will reflect today, my thoughts with respect to economics primarily and some that will reflect my feelings with respect to national defense. \\n   So I would like to talk about economics, a topic that has been one of my passions as a Member of the Congress. Economic policy was the very reason I ran for the House of Representatives back in 1982. As many of us may recall, our country remained in a deep recession at the time, still struggling to recover from the economic policies of the 1970s. Although it was still being phased in, President Reagan's economic program was under attack by our friends across the aisle. But, to me, the Reagan economic program was a bold reaffirmation of the very purpose of America. \\n   Many people have noted the happy coincidence that the year 1776 saw the publication of two of the most important documents in world history, Adam Smith's ``Wealth Of Nations'' and Thomas Jefferson's Declaration of Independence. These works share the theme of freedom. Smith made the case for free trade and unfettered markets, as Jefferson put in words the concept that government exists to protect individual liberty. \\n   These documents rebutted, refined, and transcended the prevailing views of 1776 Great Britain. For over a century, these principles held firm and the United States stood tall as a beacon of hope and opportunity for people from all points on the globe. \\n   Ours was a society without a rigid class structure, a society that promised equal opportunity for all based on individual enterprise and hard work, not government privileges and connections. America had no large bureaucracies intruding upon every sphere of commercial life. We relied on the willingness of individuals to shoulder the risk and responsibility that is part and parcel of private enterprise. \\n   But this distinctly American way was challenged by two worldwide crises in the 20th century. First came the Great Depression. Although gross government mismanagement of the money supply and counterproductive trade policies were the cause of this crisis, government was put forward as the cure. This led to the proliferation of alphabet agencies seeking to steer every aspect of the American economy, as government assumed a new income redistribution role. \\n   The second crisis was the rise of totalitarianism on the European Continent. The United States won World War II, but in the process of saving Europe from one brand of tyranny, an equally evil force came to occupy half of Europe, and the war effort was used as the justification for price controls and economic intervention that was unprecedented in the United States. \\n   The welfare state in America grew by leaps and bounds. Once it was conceded that the Government is the guarantor of income, each successive call for new and bigger programs became harder and harder to resist. At the same time, the consolidation of the Soviet bloc presented the largest threat to freedom in human history, presenting new and costly challenges for America as the beacon of freedom. Exaggerations of Soviet economic success fueled the call for greater Government involvement in the U.S. economy. Over time, high tax rates and regulatory excesses accumulated like barnacles to slow the once mighty ship of American private enterprise. \\n   It is hard for younger Americans to imagine how bleak our Nation's prospects appeared before Reagan assumed the Presidency. Recurrent, simultaneous bouts of high unemployment and high inflation confounded most economists, who viewed the two as a tradeoff. It was thought that to reduce unemployment you had to accept inflation and to reduce inflation you had to accept higher unemployment. Producers and consumers suffered from an energy crisis. And real household incomes were shrinking as fast as ``bracket creep'' was raising everyone's tax bill year after year. The response of the incumbent administration was hardly inspiring--ranging from suggesting ``voluntary'' wage and price controls to preaching that we must learn to live within limits. In short, the American establishment was telling the American people to accept the notion that they no longer controlled their own economic destinies. \\n   Starting in the 1970s, the media aggressively advanced the notion popular in intellectual circles that America's free enterprise system was failing. This view persisted through the 1980s. The best-seller lists were crowded with books telling of the decline of America and predicting that Japan would be the economic juggernaut of the 21st century. Even in the 1992 campaign, Bill Clinton and AL GORE were extolling the virtues of the European economic systems, of social democracy and industrial planning. We hear echoes of this approach today, with candidate AL GORE's Government-knows-best mentality. GORE proposes to micromanage and fine-tune the economy, social engineering through tax credits designed to make people behave the way the Washington bureaucrats want them to--such as buying ``fuel-efficient'' eighteen-wheeler trucks. \\n   Ronald Reagan's ``Program for Economic Recovery'' was the opposite of the Government planning approach advocated by the critics of capitalism. Reagan rejected the idea that policymakers could fine-tune the economy,  much less control it from Washington. Instead, he sought to establish a stable environment conducive to economic growth. This meant getting inflation under control, and reducing taxes, regulation, and the size and scope of Government. It meant restoring the incentives for working, saving, investing, and succeeding. It meant opening America to the benefits and challenges of international trade. \\n   Ronald Reagan's economic principles resonated within me. I had seen first-hand the obvious connection between the expansion of Government and our worsening economic performance. When I started in the banking business in 1966, I probably spent 90 to 95 percent of my time engaged in activities that I considered productive--designing new services to attract business, working to increase the market share and profitability of the bank. The rest involved Government paperwork. By the time I left in 1982, this ratio had completely flipped: I was spending 85 to 90 percent of my time trying to figure out how to comply with Government regulations and mandates. There was a constant stream of letters from the Government dictating how we should manage our business, from the Comptroller of the Currency, the Treasury, the FDIC, and the Federal Reserve, on topics ranging from flood insurance to so-called truth-in-lending. I remember a letter that went so far as to tell us the specific temperatures to set our heating and cooling thermostats in our businesses. Some people may have forgotten this level of Government intrusion. \\n   In fact, others may believe it never could happen in a country such as America, but it has. It has happened before, and if we are not vigilant, it could happen again. \\n   I received a letter from Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker detailing which types of loans we could and could not make. To make the example, I could lend a family money to add an additional bedroom to their home. If that same family wanted to add a swimming pool to their home, I was prohibited from making that loan. \\n   To some, this may have made sense if you believed that the Government should be managing consumer demand, but that role made no sense to me. \\n   With my experience in the banking business, it wasn't hard to understand why we as a nation were having difficulty competing around the globe, when we had moved so many of our resources away from productive activities and into trying to comply with Government regulations. Over the years I had come to realize that all the abstract Keynesian theories I was taught in college ignored how the choices and incentives of individuals are altered by government interference in the economy. By failing to account for the real world, those theories in practice had come pretty close to ruining the economy. But along came Ronald Reagan, with a common sense approach that went back to basics--free markets, free enterprise, free trade. Here was a man who had recognized that big Government was a detriment to the economy, a man who approached things from the perspective of freedom as opposed to Government. I shared that perspective and recognized the importance of President Reagan's election. On election night, November 4, 1980, I knew that I had to get involved in this great campaign to restore freedom--but I would have never guessed that, two decades later, I would be standing here in the United States Senate. \\n   Ronald Reagan clearly saw that the problem was too much government, and the solution was more individual freedom. When he assumed the Presidency, we suffered from high inflation and high unemployment. To combat the first, he prescribed reigning in the rapid growth of the money supply, asking the Fed to minimize the damage to the economy caused by high and volatile inflation. The second problem required deep cuts in the high tax rates that were deterring work, saving, and investment. But the Fed delivered tight money a lot sooner than the Congress could deliver the tax cuts, which were phased-in over 3 years. The Fed had overreacted to the stimulus of tax cuts that had not yet arrived, exacerbating the economic downtown, throwing the budget seriously out of balance, and putting the third year of the Reagan tax rate reductions in jeopardy. \\n   In the recession of the early 1980s, the economic policies of President Reagan that inspired me to public service came under attack. In the now famous ``Stay the Course'' campaign of 1982, the President's party retained control of the Senate, minimized losses in the House despite the dire economic times, and preserved the Reagan economic program. We also kept on track President Reagan's defense policies, which were under attack from short-sighted critics who were unwilling to pay the price to ensure our freedom. I am proud that my first campaign was in that fateful year, when President Reagan's detractors stood a chance of putting his programs in jeopardy and I was able to make a stand in favor of his programs. \\n   As I mentioned, the Reagan economic program was my inspiration to run for office. As a freshman, I cut my teeth in the House by circulating a letter vowing support for the President's veto of any bill that tampered with the third year of the tax cuts. After I obtained the 146 signatures necessary to sustain a veto, that threat disappeared, and the Kemp-Roth tax cuts were allowed to work. President Reagan's most dramatic policy change was without a doubt this supply-side tax cut. It seems also inconceivable today that just two decades ago, marginal income tax rates were as high as 70 percent in the United States. It was little wonder that our country was in economic decline, when its most economically productive citizens could keep only a 30 percent share of their additional earnings. These high tax rates not only discouraged additional work and investment at the margin, but also confiscated capital that could have been used for job creation by the private sector. \\n   By cutting income tax rates by 30 percent across-the-board, Reagan restored a large measure of freedom to the American taxpayer--not just the freedom to spend money that would have been taxed away, but the freedom that results when economic decisions are no longer influenced by high tax rates. It was not about the dollars that would have been collected had tax rates stayed high, but the choices that would never have been made because of these high rates--decisions to expand plant capacities or start new businesses, for instance. \\n   President Reagan entered the White House with one paramount spending goal: to rebuild our national defense, since national security is the most fundamental responsibility of the Federal Government. He realized that to provide this desperately needed public good, while cutting tax rates to unleash the productive forces of the nation, required fiscal restraint in the non-defense portion of the Federal budget. \\n   The difficulties that President Reagan had in taming the congressional urge to spend made a balanced budget and tax limitation amendment to the Constitution one of my top priorities when I entered Congress. It also motivated me to be the main House sponsor, along with Dick Cheney, of the Gramm-Rudman Deficit Reduction Act, which worked for at least a few years to hold spending down. Today, as much as ever, I believe some super majority restriction on the ability of Members of Congress to spend taxpayers' dollars is necessary. Unless taxes are cut to keep the revenues from flowing into Washington, the trillions of dollars of surpluses that are projected over the next decade will not last--if the taxes are collected, Congress will spend them. \\n   Reagan also initiated a sea change in monetary policy. He did not want the Federal Reserve to manipulate the money supply in an attempt to target interest or unemployment rates. All he wanted was price stability, the elimination of high levels of inflation from the economy. The Fed should not be responsible for the level of growth in the economy--this is the role of the private sector. The best economic environment that the Fed can provide is one in which inflation expectations play a small or almost nonexistent role in long-term planning. Reagan's appointees to the Federal Reserve Board, people like Alan Greenspan, Preston Martin, Manley Johnson, Martha Seger, and Wayne Angell, shared this view and took politics out of monetary policy.  \\n   Throughout the Reagan years, the loudest and strongest advocate of stable prices in the Congress was Jack Kemp. Jack would talk tirelessly about the need for ``a dollar as good as gold,'' and his intellectual and political support for this position no doubt influenced President Reagan's selection of Greenspan as Fed Chairman. Alan Greenspan continues to hold sway at the Federal Reserve as part of the Reagan legacy, and his record at containing inflation has set a high standard. As a member of the Senate Banking Committee I have attempted to institutionalize this approach to monetary policy, sponsoring a bill that would make price stability, not economic growth or ``stabilization,'' the goal of the Federal Reserve. Thanks to the monetary policy initiated by President Reagan, this legislation is now a safeguard rather than a necessity. \\n   The prevailing attitude concerning trade has also shifted, thanks to President Reagan--who recognized the fallacy of protectionism. In large part, this was due to his belief in competition and free enterprise. But his attitude was also shaped by his confidence in America. He was neither afraid of foreign competition, nor embarrassed that imports might be preferred over American goods. America, as a nation of immigrants, represents the best that the world can offer. More than any consumer good, the main export of America must be the ideal of political and economic freedom, an ideal that is undercut by trade restrictions. \\n   By signing a free trade agreement with Canada, opening free trade negotiations with Mexico, and proposing the dismantling of agricultural trade barriers in the Uruguay Round of the GATT, Ronald Reagan went on the offensive for trade liberalization. At a time when Japan-bashing was commonplace--when Members of Congress were literally bashing Japanese-made electronics into pieces on the steps of the Capitol--Reagan did not retreat from his basic free-trade principles. The remarkable success of U.S. industries from computers, semiconductors, software, biotechnology and many others over the past 2 decades has vindicated Reagan's belief that American business prospers best in an open and competitive free enterprise environment. \\n   Today, principally as a result of the supply-side policies pursued by the Reagan administration, the U.S. economy is healthy. Both inflation and unemployment are low. Productivity is growing rapidly and incomes are rising. \\n   Any doubts that President Reagan is responsible for today's bounty should be dispelled by considering a few fundamental questions. Would American economic growth be as robust today if the Federal Government still took 70 cents of every additional dollar of income from our most productive citizens? If the typical family was hit with a 49 percent Federal income tax rate on top of an effective payroll tax rate of 14.2 percent? \\n   Would our economy be so strong if we were still suffering from double-digit inflation and interest rates, due to the politicized use of monetary policy to manipulate consumer demand? If the trend of the last 2 decades were toward managed trade, rather than freer trade? Would entrepreneurs and innovators abound if high inflation and high tax rates on capital gains slashed the returns to their risk-taking? \\n   Would the Soviet Empire have fallen if it had not been for the military buildup, diplomatic leadership, and resolute defense of freedom during the presidency of Ronald Reagan? Would our country be as secure as it is today if instead of trading partners, the people of Eastern and Central Europe were still prisoners of the Soviet bloc? If our fellow Americans south of our border were still the potential victims of imported totalitarianism instead of full participants in established democracies? \\n   Our debt to Ronald Reagan reminds me of an exchange mission I once went on, with Tom Foley and Dick Cheney. \\n   It was a congressional delegation that went to France in 1985. On that trip, we spent most of our time in Paris. But for the last several days, we went out to the French countryside. I went to a little town called Le Mans, where I traveled around with my host, Francois, from that district. I learned a lot about what his country was experiencing. \\n   At the end of that tour, we did what many of us would refer to as an old-fashioned town meeting, where I responded to questions from the French audience for almost 2 hours. At the end of the period, I asked Francois if it would be all right if I were to ask the audience a question. And he was gracious in my request, and I asked them: Since I am returning to America tomorrow, I would like to be able to tell other people of the State of Florida what you think about our country. \\n   The first person stood up and said: ``We think of America as a dynamic, growing, thriving, exciting place.'' A second person that stood up said basically the same thing. The third person to address me was a fellow who probably was in his late 70's or early 80's. This fellow was stooped over, his weight being supported precariously on an old, gnarled cane. He came over closer to me, looked me directly in the eyes, and said: ``You tell the people of America that we will never forget that it was the American G.I. who saved our little town. You tell them we'll never forget!'' \\n   Well, I feel that way about Ronald Reagan, my political hero, who inspired me to enter politics. America will never forget what President Reagan did for us. He gave us back our faith and renewed our belief in this country. He gave America back its pride. He rebuilt America's defenses. His economic policies reduced taxes, reduced inflation, reduced unemployment. He put America back to work again. He reminded America what made us a great nation--our commitment to freedom. And he won the cold war without firing a single shot. \\n   The citizens of America and the people of the world will never forget. \\n   Mr. President, I yield the floor.    \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20001005\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it recess until the hour of 9:30 a.m. on Friday, October 6. I further ask unanimous consent that on Friday, immediately following the prayer, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and the Senate then begin a period of morning business with the time until 10 a.m. equally divided in the usual form. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20001005\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 10 a.m. Following morning business, the Senate may begin consideration of the Transportation appropriations conference report or the sex trafficking victims conference report. It is hoped that the Senate can begin consideration of either of these conference reports prior to noon tomorrow. Therefore, votes could occur by midmorning. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-20001005\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Certainly. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-3-20001005\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I think that is probably as close to a ``definite maybe'' as you can get in the Senate at this time. \\n   I suggest the absence of a quorum. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20001005\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of Coptic Christians in Egypt who have been persecuted because of their religious beliefs. According to reports by both the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights and Freedom House in the United States, up to 1,200 Coptic Christians in Al-Kosheh, Egypt, were detained, interrogated, and subjected to police brutality in relation to the murders of two other Coptic Christians in 1998. After weeks of reported torture, these accounts suggest that confessions were obtained under duress that identified Shaiboub William Arsel as the murderer. Mr. Arsel was subsequently sentenced to 15 years of hard labor. \\n   Over the last two years I have met with officials from the Egyptian government, including President Hosni Mubarak on several occasions in an attempt to address this issue quietly. Unfortunately, these discussions have failed to produce sufficient action on the part of the government of Egypt. As a result, I rise today to submit a resolution urging the President to encourage the Egyptian government to provide Shaiboub William Arsel with a timely and open appeal that would include international observers, and furthermore to complete an independent investigation of the police brutality in Al-Kosheh. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20001005\\n\\n   Mr. MACK.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be agreed to, the bill be read a third time and passed, as amended, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements relating to the bill be printed in the RECORD. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20001003\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, as a co-sponsor of the Community Renewal and New Markets Act of 2000, I want to commend Chairman ROTH for his usual fine work in assembling a bill that garners the support of such a large number of our Finance Committee colleagues. I am pleased that a number of items in this bill are provisions that are extremely important to me, and I would like to speak briefly concerning them. \\n   But I also want to draw attention to some provisions in this bill that I do not favor. As this bill stands in the place of what would have been a bill reported out of the Committee on Finance, it reflects the compromises that are inherent in the committee process. Unlike typical bills, of which it is reasonable to assume that every provision is supported by every co-sponsor, probably every co-sponsor of this bill can find provisions contained in it that he does not support. Of many, there are two that I find most troubling: the ``new markets tax credit,'' and the ``individual development accounts.'' \\n   These two provisions are appropriations masquerading as tax cuts. Under the new markets tax credit, the Secretary of the Treasury would annually pay dividends to investors in ``community development entities,'' which must be certified by the Treasury Department and which must have as their primary mission investing in low-income people or communities. This proposal is premised on the belief that an entity that lacks a profit-motive, under federal bureaucratic supervision, will be an attractive investment for people if dividends are guaranteed. It is the sort of scheme that could only be dreamed up by people who have spent their entire careers in government. A simpler way to direct capital to investment-starved pockets is by eliminating the tax on capital gains--this is the decentralized, market-oriented approach. \\n   The ``individual development accounts'' would launder government-matching funds for low income savers through financial institutions. This new entitlement cannot be justified. It is true that, by some measures, the savings rate in the United States appears low. Simple logic dictates that the savings rate have been lowered due to federal tax policies, which impose several layers of taxation upon income that is saved. It is one thing to address this problem at the source, by removing the extra taxation on savings--a we do to the extent that people can make deductible contributions to traditional IRAs and contributions to Roth IRAs. But to give people money to reward them for saving is pure income redistribution, a misuse of the taxpayers' money. \\n   Despite my disagreement with some of the provisions of this bill, I am pleased that the bill contains several initiatives that I have proposed over the past few Congresses. The Low Income Housing Tax Credit is boosted to make up for over a decade's worth of inflation, and is indexed to prevent this problem from reoccurring. The First-Time Homebuyer Tax Credit for the District of Columbia is extended and the marriage penalty in the credit is eliminated. Section 1706 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which discriminates against high technology workers and the companies that hire them, is repealed. Not-for-hire disaster insurance funds, in my state of Florida and several others, are made tax-exempt entities. \\n   I am most encouraged by the extension of my zero percent capital gains tax rate proposal to businesses in the entire District of Columbia, and to businesses in all empowerment and renewal zones. Although I am concerned that the lengthy, five-year holding period is unwise and undermines the power of the proposal, I am nevertheless pleased that the idea is spreading and people are coming to see capitalism as the only true cure for poverty. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20001002\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I move to lay that motion on the table. \\n   The motion to lay on the table was agreed to. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000925\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Madam President, I rise today to engage my colleague from Florida in a colloquy. Specifically, I want to clarify our understanding of the portion of the legislation we're considering today to restore, preserve and protect the Everglades ecosystem. My understanding is that the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan authorized by this bill create a balance between state and federal interests in ensuring that the predicted Plan benefits--including benefits to both state and federal lands--are attained. It is my view that this bill is intended to recognize and maintain the State's interest in preserving the sovereignty, in State law, over the reservation and allocation of water within the State's boundaries. It is my further understanding that the Agreement called for between the President and the Governor of Florida will not result in a federalization of State water law. Florida water law requires that all reasonable beneficial water uses and natural system demands are subject to a public interest balancing test. Implementation of the Plan will rely upon State law and processes for reserving and allocating water for all users, according to the principles set out in the legislation before us. It is not the intent of this Act, or the President/Governor Agreement required by this Act, to create a procedure where all of the new water made available by the Plan will be allocated to the natural system leaving nothing for other water users. Rather, the agreement will simply ensure that water for the natural system is reserved first, and any remaining water may be allocated among other users according to the provisions of State water law. I yield to my colleague from Florida, Senator GRAHAM. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-20000925\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I appreciate the comments of my colleague and yield the floor. \\n   SECTON 211, PROJECT DEAUTHORIZATION\\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-3-20000925\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Madam President, I rise today to call the Senate's attention to a provision of the bill before us expressing the sense of the Senate concerning Homestead Air Force Base in Florida. I want to take a moment of the Senate's time today to express my understanding of this resolution and my own intent in agreeing to its inclusion in the bill before us today. \\n   As my colleagues are aware, this Air Force base is currently in the disposal process set forth by Congress when it established a fair and impartial system for closing military facilities around the country. Since Hurricane Andrew devastated the region in 1992, the citizens of South Florida have waited for a disposal decision from the federal government. It is anticipated the property could provide a stable economic platform for a community that is in need of jobs and economic development. Clearly, it is my intent that whatever use to which the property is ultimately put be accomplished in a manner that does not adversely impact the surrounding environment or the Everglades restoration plan we're considering today. \\n   But let me be clear, Mr. President. It is emphatically not my intent that this resolution be read by the United States Air Force to mean they should add to, alter, or amend the existing process for disposing the property at Homestead Air Force Base. It is my strong view that the process for conveying surplus military property is clearly set forth in the law and that process should be followed until the final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement on the property is completed and the Air Force disposes the property. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-4-20000925\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Yes. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-5-20000925\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Madam President, I will only take a moment of the Senate's time today--prior to the vote on the Water Resources Development Act--to acknowledge the importance of this moment and the action the Senate will take today to restore and preserve America's Everglades. \\n   My colleague, Senator GRAHAM, and I have worked for eight years to bring this bill to the floor and it gives me great satisfaction that today it will be approved by the Senate. \\n   I want especially to thank Chairman SMITH for his dedication to this effort over the past few months. He has worked side-by-side with us to develop the consensus product we're voting on today. As we developed this legislation, he and his staff provided valuable input into the process and we appreciate the long hours they put in on our behalf. \\n   Further, I want to--once again--acknowledge my colleague, Senator GRAHAM. He has worked on Everglades issues for years--even prior to his time in the Senate--and it has been a pleasure to work with him over the years as we worked on the legislation before us. \\n   The Corps of Engineers, the Department of Interior, and the Council on Environmental Quality have worked long hours to turn this bill into reality. I appreciate the support of these agencies throughout the process and for the proof--once again--that saving the Everglades is not a partisan issue. \\n   And finally, I want to acknowledge the hard work and steadfast support of Governor Bush. The State of Florida is a full partner with us in this restoration effort, and I believe the work we've put in together in writing this bill bodes well for a lasting partnership on behalf of the Everglades. \\n   The Everglades is an American treasure. Today we in the Senate will take a major step forward in passing a restoration plan that is rooted in good science, common sense, and consensus. I thank everyone who participated in this process for their hard work and dedication to the effort. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000921\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I want to say to my dear friend, the Senator from Virginia, I thoroughly enjoyed listening to his presentation. And I say this with all good humor. It was a great performance. It reminded me a little of Chicken Little in ``The Sky is Falling'' when I listened to equating $86 million in operating expenses to a $1.4 billion budget. The $86 million will be the cost of operating and maintaining this new system 25 or 30 years from now. I think it might be appropriate to try to figure out what the Corps' budget might be 25 or 30 years from now. I think that would bring a more significant understanding of the impact of the operating and maintenance costs to the Federal Government. \\n   The second point I will make is that we are already spending more than that now on the Everglades. I suggest that on this project we are proposing today--and I believe strongly that it will pass--we will probably seek a reduction in the long run as a part of the Corps' budget. But, again, I appreciate the fervor with which my colleague presented his argument. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-20000921\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I am sure we will.  \\n   Mr. President, I am in strong opposition to the amendment offered by my friend from Virginia. This amendment, if passed, will put an end to the unprecedented partnership developed between the Federal Government and the State of Florida in an effort to restore and protect America's Everglades. While I am sure my colleague from Virginia has the best of intentions in offering his amendment, I caution my colleagues that one-size-fits-all solutions can be extremely harmful to \\n   something as sensitive and as difficult as Everglades restoration. \\n   It may be useful to take a few minutes today to help highlight the Everglades provision in the water resources bill before us and explain how the amendment of the Senator from Virginia will impact our longstanding efforts to restore and protect this unique ecosystem. \\n   Let me begin by stating that the legislation before us today is a consensus product supported by a full spectrum of environmental groups and economic stakeholders. It is supported by Florida's two Indian tribes, Gov. Jeb Bush of the State of Florida, and it is supported by the Clinton administration. \\n   Nine months ago, my colleague from Florida, Senator GRAHAM, and I set out to write a balanced Everglades bill that addressed the needs of south Florida's environment and its citizens. This was no small task. We asked individuals and groups who have long been divided to set aside their differences and work together with us. We asked them to help us restore this vibrant, natural system to its former glory. With the steady leadership of Chairman BOB SMITH and Senator BAUCUS, we have accomplished our goal. The bill we bring to the floor today is something of which all Americans, and I believe all Senators, can be proud. \\n   In the bill we are considering today, we authorize a comprehensive plan to undo the harm done by 50 years of Federal efforts to control flooding in south Florida, without consideration for damage done to south Florida's environment. This comprehensive plan was developed over the past 8 years by the Corps of Engineers, with input from economic and environmental stakeholders, local governments, scientists, restoration engineers, the people of south Florida, and the Congress. It is recognized throughout south Florida and the Nation as a fair and balanced plan to provide for the water-related needs of the region while, for the first time, ensuring that the needs of the Everglades will be met as well. \\n   It is terribly important that we do this. Without this plan, the Everglades will die and water, the lifeblood of south Florida's economy, will continue to be siphoned off into the sea without benefiting the environment or the people who live and work in the region. \\n   Let me take a moment to share with you some of the principles Senator GRAHAM and I have used to guide our efforts this year in drafting this bill. We wanted to be sensitive to the legitimate concerns and needs of all citizens and interests who have a stake in how the plan is implemented, we wanted to be true to the restoration mandate and ensure that the Everglades got the first benefit of any new water generated by the plan, and we wanted to affirm and establish in law the true partnership we share with the State of Florida in achieving the plan's restoration goal. \\n   The cooperation between the State agencies charged with managing this effort and the Federal Government over the years has been truly unprecedented. The State shared the cost of developing the plan we are considering today. The Corps of Engineers has benefited greatly from the engineering talent at the South Florida Water Management District. Florida has been our full partner in bearing half of the cost of the restoration projects already underway in the Everglades. The State has committed to split evenly the cost of implementing the plan once it is authorized. The reason for this partnership is simple. \\n   Both the State and Federal Government have a vital interest in the restoration of the Everglades. Both the State and the Federal Government should pay for the cost of operating and maintaining the restoration project once it is built. \\n   I say this to provide background for the debate on the amendment before us. This partnership we have established is vital to our efforts, and if this amendment passes, it will be very difficult to accomplish our restoration goals. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-3-20000921\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, a key part of this partnership has been the commitment by the State of Florida--already enshrined in a bill approved by Governor Bush earlier this year--to pay fully half the $7.8 billion cost of implementing the Everglades restoration plan. This is a significantly greater cost share than the local sponsor typically pays to construct a Corps project. \\n   Many Corps projects have a local cost share of as little as 20 percent of the total project and few pay more than 35 percent. In fact, if the State were paying 35 percent, rather than the 50 percent it has committed to, it would increase the burden of the Federal taxpayer by almost $1.2 billion. Let me repeat that. The State has committed to a greater-than-average cost share for constructing the restoration project and will save the Federal taxpayers almost $1.2 billion. \\n   I believe the good faith demonstrated by the State's offer--not to mention the resulting savings of the Federal Government--clearly refutes any argument that the State is somehow unduly benefiting from the operation and maintenance cost share proposed in the bill before us today. \\n   While I cannot stress enough the damage this amendment will do to our relationship with the State of Florida, I remind my colleagues about the significant Federal investment we are making in the Everglades and the important Federal interest in ensuring this project is operated and maintained properly. \\n   Within the boundaries of the proposed restoration area, there are four national parks, including Everglades National Park, one of the crown jewels of our National Park System. There is a national marine sanctuary and many other national interests. All of these important environmental assets are dependent upon the successful operation of the restoration plan. \\n   If the project is not operated properly--if the water is not right--these important Federal holdings in south Florida will continue to suffer the same fate they are suffering today. If we and the State of Florida are to come together behind a restoration plan and spend $7.8 billion to implement that plan, it seems we also have the responsibility and obligation to stay in Florida and help with the successful operation and maintenance of the project. That is a reasonable position. \\n   I add that the operation and maintenance cost share in this bill is fully consistent with prior central and southern Florida project authorizations. In fact, the Federal Government pays the full cost of operating and maintaining the levees, channels, locks, and control works of the St. Lucie Canal, Lake Okeechobee, and the Caloosahatchee River. The Federal Government pays the full cost--not 50-50, but the full cost--of operating the levees, channels, locks, and control works of the St. Lucie Canal, Lake Okeechobee, and the Caloosahatchee River. All of these areas that I have mentioned are in this restoration area. It pays the full cost of operating and maintaining the main spillways in the system's water conservation area. \\n   Further, the Flood Control Act of 1968 provided that the project costs of providing water delivery to Everglades National Park is considered a federal responsibility and on that basis the federal government would share in the operation and maintenance of projects that serve that area of the system. The federal government is also required, under a 1989 law, to participate in the cost share for the modified water deliveries project. And, finally, the water resources bill of 1996 provides that the cost of operating and maintaining water deliveries to Taylor Slough and Everglades National Park be shared between the State and federal governments. \\n   That is my argument to this constant mention of the fact that for 14 years we have had this precedent.  \\n   I have just stated the whole series of issues related to the Everglades in which there is a whole range of the sharing of costs and maintaining the Everglades system. \\n   There appears to be ample precedent for a shared cost between the State and federal governments on projects related to the Everglades and Everglades restoration. \\n   What the Senator from Virginia is advocating is something far different. He would have the federal government pack up and leave when the restoration project is completed--essentially abandoning precedent and abandoning a national treasure after an unprecedented effort to save it. His amendment would have the federal government abdicate its responsibility, to both the environment and the taxpayer, to protect the substantial investment we're making on their behalf in the Everglades. \\n   I would remind my colleagues, the Everglades is a dynamic system. It is dependent on the steady, reliable supply of fresh water this restoration project will provide over the years. \\n   It is not like a levee, or a bridge, which the federal government can construct and turn over to the local authorities. This is an enormously complex restoration project managing the water flow over and through 18,000 square miles of subtropical uplands, wetlands and coral reefs. The area covered by this project spans from Lake Okeechobee to Key West; from Fort Myers on the gulf to Fort Pierce on the Atlantic. \\n   This is not an investment we can afford to abandon, Mr. President. The investment is too great and the stakes are too high. I would urge my colleagues to defeat the amendment. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-4-20000921\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I wanted to respond to the question. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-5-20000921\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. This will be a brief response. I apologize to my colleagues for trying to hop in here, but the Senator raised a question I thought should be responded to: What makes us different? \\n   In the State of Florida, in 1994, we passed the Everglades Forever Act which provides for local payment of water cleanup costs. The Federal Government's share in the cost of cleaning up the water that directly benefits Federal areas such as the Everglades National Park--the fact is that the local communities are paying for the cleanup of the waters that the Senator has suggested. \\n   The second point I make, I think there is something unique about what we have come up with. The Senator says the uniqueness is the 50-50 cost sharing. The uniqueness that I see--and I don't think there is a Member who has traveled to the State of Florida and become involved and knowledgeable about the Everglades Project, who is not amazed by the partnerships that have been developed--is the various interests in our State that have come together and who have said not only do they support but they are willing to put money into it. \\n   As the Senator knows, the State of Florida, during this past legislative session, in fact, put up I believe almost $200 million towards this project. \\n   Again, to answer the question directly, the cities are, in fact, paying. The State of Florida anticipated that question in 1994 and passed the act that I referred to a few moments ago. \\n   I thank the Senator for yielding. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-6-20000921\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I believe, if I can respond, and perhaps I can \\n   find the language, if you read further on in the act, you will find some language that has to do with some cost sharing of the area that the Senator is referring to as identifying certain aspects of the bill, but there are other references in there about following precedent with respect to cost sharing. There is, as I read in my statement, a whole series of things in which there is even 100-percent participation at the Federal level for operation and maintenance. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-7-20000921\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I respond to the question raised by the Senator from Virginia when we were talking about cost share. I suggested to Senator WARNER, if he looked in other places in Public Law 104, which is referred to as the Water Resources Development Act of 1996, he would find other language different from the language to which he was referring. That is found in section 316, central and southern Florida Canal, 111. Under ``Operation and Maintenance,'' it says:  \\n   The non-Federal share of operation and maintenance cost of the improvements undertaken pursuant to this section shall be 100 percent;  \\n   However, if you go on, it says:  \\n   ......except that the Federal Government shall reimburse the non-Federal interest with respect to the project 60 percent of the cost of operating and maintaining pump stations that pump water into Taylor Slough and in the Everglades National Park.  \\n   I wonder what the argument was 14 years ago about changing precedent. People want to refer to precedent. The reality is that Congress does what the Congress believes is necessary to carry out an important project. I think it is pretty clear. In fact, my colleagues who oppose this cost share have indicated they are going to support the resolution, or support the act; therefore, I think, accepting the notion of the significance and importance of what we are doing. And therefore it is reasonable for the Senate to determine on this particular project because of its unusual, unique circumstances, that somehow we should, in fact, have a 50-50 cost share. \\n   I do not find that stunning, and I am not impressed with the fact that for the last 14 years which some want to refer to that there has been a precedent established. There are all kinds of indications that we have had different cost shares, to the extent that we find in some areas the Federal Government is picking up 100 percent of the cost of operation and maintenance. \\n   I again say to my colleagues, I hope they will support Senator GRAHAM and I and Senators SMITH and BAUCUS and defeat this amendment. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-8-20000921\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I echo the sentiments of the Senator from Florida about the Adaptive Assessment and Monitoring Program. As this is a long-term plan spanning almost 25 years in execution, it stands to reason that research will yield new information and technology changes will yield new solutions. The Adaptive Assessment and Monitoring Program is critical to ensuring that this new information is incorporated into our planning process for this project. The type of collaboration described by my colleague from Florida will ensure that resources are wisely spent by utilizing and expanding monitoring programs already in operation. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000919\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the future of U.S. trade relations with China and the impending vote on China's PNTR status. The prosperity that this nation has enjoyed for the past 50 years has been a result of our commitment to free trade and opening markets. Free trade benefits all--it enhances prosperity and develops markets, essential elements to the spread of freedom, democracy, and the rule of law. China's entry into the World Trade Organization will also enhance American competitiveness, further our national interests, and benefit our trading partners. But we must enter into this agreement with our eyes open. China must comply with this agreement for it to have meaning. The United States must vigilantly seek enforcement of all agreements with China, including those addressing national security and human rights. \\n   I share the concern of my colleague, Senator THOMPSON, regarding China's proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. On August 9th of this year, the Director of Central Intelligence reported that China remained a ``key supplier'' of weapons technology and increased-missile related assistance to Pakistan as recently as the second half of 1999. In the last year it has been reported that China transferred missile technology to Libya and North Korea and may still be providing secret technical assistance to Pakistan's nuclear program. U.S. Intelligence has also provided evidence that the PRC has provided Iran with nuclear technology, chemical weapons materials, and missile technology that would violate China's commitment to observe the MTCR and U.S. laws. I do not suggest that because of these violations we should cut off trade with China, but we must address the fact that they are supplying rogue nations with weapons of mass destruction. This threat to our national security has made my decision on this vote a difficult one, and that has been compounded by my concerns with China's repeated human rights abuses. \\n   I suspect that each of my colleagues has had some opportunity over the years to hear about the human rights abuses taking place in China. I think one of the more eloquent spokesmen for the struggle for freedom has been Wei Jingsheng. He reminds us that those of us who live in the luxury of freedom should not forget those who are still struggling for liberty and freedom. \\n   Mr. President, because of these very strong conflicting views, the importance of open and free trade on the one hand, and the importance of human dignity and the pursuit of freedom on the other, this has been a difficult decision for me. But, after due consideration, I conclude that moving toward open and free markets advances freedom in China, so long as China is willing to abide by the rules of the WTO. \\n   By exposing China to global competition and the benefits it has to offer, Chinese leaders will be both obligated and empowered to more quickly move their country toward full economic reform. And by virtue of their business relationships, over time the Chinese people will be exposed to information, ideas and debate from around the world. This in turn will encourage them and their leadership to embrace the virtue and promise of individual freedom. The reason I am willing to embrace it has much has to do with the kinds of changes we have seen taking place in China over the years. If they were still committed to the ideology of the 1950's and 1960's, I do not think we would be here today. But, they have clearly moved toward opening their economy, and we should continue to push to open the country to freedom. \\n   So I think it is time for us to respond to these changes by saying to the Chinese people--we want to be engaged in free trade and competition with you. I think, in the end, humanity will benefit. So I will cast a vote in favor of this legislation. \\n   Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000727\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 11 a.m., for those Senators who wish to make final statements in remembrance of our former friend and colleague, Senator PAUL COVERDELL. \\n   Following morning business, Senator designate Zell Miller will be sworn in to serve as United States Senator. After the ceremony and a few remarks, the Senate will proceed to a cloture vote on the motion to proceed to the energy and water appropriations bill. At the conclusion of the vote, the Senate will proceed to the consideration of the conference report to accompany the Department of Defense appropriations bill, with a vote to occur at approximately 3:15 p.m. For the remainder of the day, the Senate is expected to begin postcloture debate on the motion to proceed to the energy and water appropriations bill. \\n   It is hoped that a vote on cloture on the motion to proceed to the PNTR China legislation can be moved to occur at a time to be determined during today's session. I thank my colleagues for their attention. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000727\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I understand there are two bills at the desk due for their second reading. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-20000727\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I object to further proceedings on these bills at this time. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000727\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I, too, express my appreciation for the beautiful words of the Senator from West Virginia this morning. And to Father Acker: On behalf of the entire Senate, we welcome you today and appreciate greatly your words of prayer. \\n   This is a special day for all of us, as the Senator from Nevada indicated. We will be swearing in a new Senator from Georgia. We do so with heavy hearts, however. \\n   I seek recognition now for a few moments to say a few words on the life of our colleague, Senator PAUL COVERDELL. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000727\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, the 10 days since his sudden passing and the outpouring of expression from many different directions have given me the opportunity to reflect on PAUL's life, the gifts he brought to the Senate, and the impact his life had on people. \\n   I want to focus my remarks on PAUL COVERDELL's humility, which I think was his defining quality, his greatest gift, and one which had the greatest impact on the lives of others. \\n   Many people might say that humility, sometimes defined as freedom from pride or arrogance, is a quality not found often in our society today. No one disputes, however, that PAUL COVERDELL possessed a deep sense of humility. \\n   During the past 10 days, PAUL COVERDELL has been described as: Serious and low key; self-effacing; uncomfortable in the limelight; a humble public servant who became a political giant through selfless dedication and quiet civility; a very gentle and courteous person; a person people went to, felt really comfortable with, and opened up to; a person who really cared for what happened to others; a person many regarded as the Senate's leading mediator; a person of scrupulous integrity and unblemished character; a person with an unsurpassed work ethic and standard of personal ethics and devotion to what he was doing; a person who always kept his word and was someone you could count on--just to mention a few characterizations. \\n   How many of us would like to be known as individuals who possess these qualities? \\n   Too often we think success results from aggressive, enterprising, pushy, and contentious behavior. In the case  of \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000727\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I would like to engage the chairman of the Appropriations Committee and my colleague from Florida in a brief colloquy concerning the South-Florida based Advanced Tropical Remote Sensing Center and its Synthetic Aperture Radar [SAR] facility. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-20000727\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I am very pleased to have this confirmation, and to know the Senators' personal interest and support. As the Senator is aware, one of our major objectives for this center, an objective supported by the leadership of SOUTHCOM, is to greatly enhance our nation's drug traffic interdiction capability. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-3-20000727\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, it was for the purpose of securing a clarification of their intent on this matter that I sought this colloquy. I thank them for their support, interest, and leadership. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000717\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I would like to join my colleague in thanking Senators GORTON and BYRD and the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee for their support for the Archie Carr National Wildlife Refuge. Twenty percent of all loggerhead sea turtle and 35% of all green sea turtle nests in the United States occur in this twenty mile zone. Nesting densities of 1,000 nests per mile have been recorded. Approximately half of this area is available for acquisition. The funds in this legislation will be critical in our ability to move forward on these acquisitions. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000714\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues to join us to reduce the marriage penalties in the tax code. This bill will provide married couples the relief that President Clinton denied them last year with his veto of the Taxpayer Refund and Relief Act of 1999. President Clinton's action last year increased taxes by close to $800 billion and imposed a marriage penalty on middle class American families. \\n   There is no place in the Tax Code for marriage penalties. Marriage penalties are caused by tax laws that treat joint filers relatively worse than single filers with half the income. It has of late become common practice to use the Tax Code for purposes of social engineering, discouraging some actions with the stick of tax penalties and encouraging others with the carrot of tax preferences. But there is no legitimate policy reason for punishing taxpayers with higher taxes just because they happen to be married. The marriage penalties in the Tax Code undermine the family, the institution that is the foundation of our society. \\n   I view this bill as just a start. Our Tax Code will not truly be family-friendly until every single marriage penalty is rooted out and eliminated, so that married couples with twice the income of single individuals are taxed at the same rates, and are eligible for the same tax preferences--including deductions, exemptions, use of IRAs and other savings vehicles--as those single filers. This bill is an important step toward that ultimate goal. \\n   The Democrat criticisms of our bill are misplaced. They argue that our bill contains complicated phase-ins, in contrast to their simple approach. But anyone who reads the bill and their alternative would see that this is false. The Finance Committee bill contains percentages in it, sure enough. And it phases in the relief, that is true. But the percentages and the phase-ins are instructions to the Treasury and the IRS, to make adjustments to the tax brackets. The only people who have to make any new calculations under the Finance Committee bill are the bureaucrats who make up the tax tables, not the taxpayer.  \\n   By contrast, the Democrat alternative, in phasing in its relief, requires taxpayers to calculate their taxes as joint filers, then calculate their taxes as if they were single--a complicated process that requires the allocation of various deductions and credits. Next, the taxpayer would have to determine the difference between these two calculations and then reduce this by a certain percentage. That is supposed to be simple? The Democrat substitute adds to the headaches of tax filing and the demand for tax preparers and tax preparation software. \\n   The Democrats also complain that the Finance Committee bill does more than address their narrow definition of the marriage penalty. They invoke the so-called ``marriage bonus.'' But the ``marriage bonus'' is a red herring. What they call a ``marriage bonus'' results from adjusting tax brackets for joint filers to reflect the fact that two adults are sharing the household income. Under the Democrat approach, single taxpayers who marry a non-working or low-earning spouse should pay the same amount of taxes as when they were single, even though this income must be spread over the needs of two adults. \\n   This approach is fundamentally flawed. The Democrat approach would enshrine in the law a new ``homemaker penalty.'' The Democrats would make families with one earner and one stay-at-home spouse pay higher taxes than families with the same household income and two earners. \\n   But why discriminate against one-earner families? Why would we want a tax code that penalized families just because one of the spouses chooses the hard work of the household over the role of breadwinner? The Democrat alternative discourages parents from staying home with their infant children, and penalizes a person who works longer hours so that a spouse can care for elderly parents. That is just plain wrong. \\n   The Finance Committee bill reduces the marriage penalty in a rational, sensible way, by making the standard deduction for joint filers twice what it is for single filers, and by making the ranges at which income is taxed at the 15 percent and 28 percent rates twice for joint filers what they are for single filers. This recognizes that marriage is a partnership in which two adults share the household income. Our approach cuts taxes for all American families. The Democrats call this a ``bonus.'' We call it common sense. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000713\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues to vote to bury the death tax once and for all. This tax is anti-family and anti-capitalist, smothers the American Dream, and is rationalized only by the greed of government and envy of success. \\n   The debate over death tax repeal highlights, as much as any issue that we will consider, a fundamental difference in philosophy among members of this body, and between the Republican Congress and the current Administration. We in the majority believe that the federal government has no right to claims the lion's share of any person's wealth just because that person had the misfortune of dying. The proponents of the death tax think otherwise. \\n   At the root of this philosophical difference are two vastly different views of the nature of wealth creation and its role in society. The supporters of the death tax seem to harbor a pessimistic, zero-sum view of wealth--the belief that every dollar saved by one person is one less dollar for the rest of us. This belief makes it easier to argue that a ceiling be placed on the level of wealth attained by any individual or family in America--people justify the confiscation of wealth above this level by attacking as greedy any family that seeks to accumulate more at the expenses of the rest of society. \\n   But this view is flawed. There is no finite limit to the amount of wealth that can be created in a society. People become wealthy in a market economy by satisfying the wants of others. Wealth is not a windfall to people with natural intelligence or ability, or who happen to stumble across valuable resources; it is created by providing consumers the goods, materials, and services that they desire at a price that does not exceed their estimate of its value. \\n   When one understands this concept, the death tax cannot be justified. If Bill Gates had chosen a career as a government bureaucrat instead of being a software entrepreneur, the tens of billions of dollars he has amassed in wealth would not have been distributed to others in society--instead, this fortune would never have been generated. It came about because Mr. Gates has provided goods and services to the public that they valued as much or more than the price he charged. Every voluntary exchange between that free individuals in a market economy creates wealth, and the businesses that provide the most consumer satisfaction will create the most wealth. When those goods and services are not offered, this wealth is not created, and everyone in society is poorer because their preferred choice does not exist. \\n   Proponents of the death tax argue that the heirs and legatees of an individual's fortune did nothing to deserve this bounty. Since it is a windfall to these individuals, why shouldn't the government get a piece of the action? Some death tax supporters go one step further, and have argued on this very floor that, unlikely the heirs, the government has a claim to this wealth because it is responsible for the prosperous American economic environment. This argument amounts to the claim that, since government refrains from confiscating property while people are alive, the government is entitled to confiscate upon death. \\n   It makes no sense to terminate property rights at death as the price to pay for their protection while living. The inheritors of property have a right to the property not because of anything they have done, but because it is the will of the decedent. If people cannot leave to their family and friends the wealth they create, they lose the incentive to create it. The higher the rate of death tax falling on their estate, the smaller, the motive to invest in and build a business. The inheritors of property have earned the right to receive it, because they served as the motivation behind the creation of wealth beyond what decedents would consume in their respective lifetimes. \\n   It has been estimated that the death tax will cost the economy almost one trillion dollars over the next decade and almost 275,000 jobs in large part because it robs people of the incentive to invest. I regularly receive letters from older constituents explaining that they have no desire to reinvest profits in their business only to have the government claim 55 percent of the business's increase in value. I am sure all of my colleagues receive similar \\n   letters. \\n   The death tax robs people of the incentive to build up their businesses, smothering the American Dream. The death tax eliminates the jobs that these discouraged entrepreneurs would have created. The death tax reduces the savings pool, reducing capital investments and reducing future productivity. The death tax reduces the choices of goods and services available to consumers. And, perhaps worst of all, the death tax places the interest of government over that of families. \\n   Why do we have to impose a tax upon death? Every person spends a lifetime paying taxes on the earnings from which their life savings comes. The income from inherited assets, such as stock dividends or business profits, will be taxed as it is earned. And, under our death tax repeal bill, any capital gain above the exemption amount will result in capital gains taxes when the asset is actually sold. Why the hurry to impose a tax at the time of death, a tax which forces families to sell land, personal property, and business interests that had been in the family for generations? \\n   The only reasons are the greed of the government and the death tax supporters' disapproval of inherited wealth. Under current law, the federal government will be collecting over $4 trillion more in taxes than it is budgeted to spend in the next decade alone. It is the federal government that needs a limit to its ability to enjoy the fruits of the hard work of our taxpayers, not the families of these taxpayers. \\n   The supporters of the death tax seem genuinely puzzled that the American people, in poll after poll, overwhelmingly support repeal of the death tax. They cannot understand why do many people would oppose a tax that directly affects so few. But the American people understand economics much better than the death taxers. They recognize the loss of jobs and opportunity. They also harbor in their hearts the dream that one day they, too, might be so successful as to amass the wealth that is subject to the confiscatory rates of the death tax. But, most of all, they recognize that a tax may be unfair even though it targets a small segment of the population--indeed, a tax may be unfair because it does so. This part of the American spirit does not seem to be appreciated by the death taxers. \\n   Mr. President, the specter of the federal death tax should no longer hover over our citizens, waiting to swoop down and confiscate the savings that has taken a lifetime to build. I urge all of my colleagues to vote for the Death Tax Elimination Act. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000630\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Will the Chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations Subcommittee yield for a question? \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-20000630\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I was most pleased to see that the Senate report accompanying this bill urged the Department to act in a timely manner to issue a Notice of Proposed Rule Making to include psychology into the Graduate Medical Education program. As you know, the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways & Means Committee have been working with the Department of Health and Human Services on this matter since 1997. Both the Conference Report on the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (Report 105-217 issued on July 30, 1997) and the Conference Report on last year's Omnibus bill (Report 106-479 issued on November 18, 1999) urged the Department to act favorably on this matter. In fact last year's Conference Report urged the Secretary to issue Notice of Rule Making to accomplish this modification before June 1, 2000. \\n   Mr. President, we thank you for including language in your report--Report 106-292--to further support this effort. I am saddened to report that the advice the Appropriations Committee has given the Secretary is being given little notice, just like all the previous requests to her on this matter. Mr. President, at this point, I would request unanimous consent that a letter I wrote to Secretary Shalala, along with Senator GRAHAM, Congressman SHAW, and Congresswoman THURMAN on April 27, 1998 be published in the RECORD, following this colloquy. \\n   Mr. President, many letters have been written to the Secretary and Nancy Ann Min DeParle, the Administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration, on this subject. Language has been included in two Finance/Ways & Means Conference Reports on this subject. Language has been included in the L-HHS Report. Despite all of these urgings, the desired result has not been produced. Would the Chairman of the Subcommittee consider including bill language in the final bill mandating this action if the Department has not issued the Notice of Proposed Rule Making by the time the Subcommittee goes to Conference with the House. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-3-20000630\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I thank the Chairman for his response to our inquiry. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000628\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr, President, as many of my colleagues are aware, cancer has played a prominent role in my family's history. Some in our family--me, my wife Priscilla, our daughter Debbie--have been lucky enough to have fought cancer and won. Others in our family have not been so lucky. My father died of esophageal cancer, my mother died of kidney cancer and my younger brother Michael died of melanoma at the very young age of thirty-five. \\n   As a result, Priscilla and I have become very active in the fight against cancer and in spreading the message that early detection saves lives. It's a part of who we are as a family. \\n   And there are other families with their own stories. Michael J. Fox and his family are waging war against Parkinson's disease. Mary Tyler Moore and her family are fighting diabetes. Christopher Reeve and his family are searching for a cure to paralysis. And millions of other families across the United States are fighting their own battles against AIDS, sickle-cell anemia, Lou Gehrig's disease, Alzheimer's and the many, many other diseases that take our loved ones away from us. \\n   What I've come to realize in my fight against cancer is the crucial role the federal government plays in funding basic medical research at the National Institutes of Health, and how important basic research is to finding breakthroughs not just for cancer but for all of the diseases which affect our families. \\n   For several years now, doubling funding at NIH has been a primary goal of mine in the Senate. The Federal Government, mainly through the NIH, funds about 36 percent of all biomedical research in this country, and plays an especially large role in basic research. \\n   Recently, the Joint Economic Committee, released a first-of-its kind study: ``The Benefits of Medical Research and the Role of the NIH,'' which examines how funding for the NIH cuts the high economic costs of disease, reduces suffering from illness, and helps Americans live longer, healthier lives. And I'd like to take a moment, Mr. President, to share with my colleagues some of the findings in this extensive report. \\n   According to the JEC, the economic costs of illness in the U.S. are huge--approximately $3 trillion annually, or 31 percent of the nation's GDP. This includes the costs of public and private health care spending, and productivity losses from illness. Medical research can reduce \\n   these high costs. But, the NIH is fighting this $3 trillion battle with a budget of $16 billion. That's just half of a percent of the total economic cost of disease in the United States. \\n   In addition to lowering the economic costs of illness, advances in medical research greatly help people live longer and healthier lives. A recent study found that longevity increases have created ``value of life'' gains to Americans of about $2.4 trillion every year. A  significant portion of these longevity gains stem from NIH-funded research in areas such as heart disease, stroke and cancer. If just 10 percent of the value of longevity increases, $240 billion, resulted from NIH research, that would mean a return of $15 for every $1 invested in NIH. \\n   Also according to the JEC, NIH-funded research helped lead to the development of one-third of the top 21 drugs introduced over the last few decades. These drugs treat patients with ovarian cancer, AIDS, hypertension, depression, herpes, various cancers, and anemia. Future drug research holds great promise for curing many diseases and lowering the costs of illness by reducing hospital stays and invasive surgeries. In fact, one study found that a $1 increase in drug expenditures reduces hospital costs by about $3.65. \\n   We know that past medical advances have dramatically reduced health care costs for such illnesses as tuberculosis, polio, peptic ulcers, and schizophrenia. For example, the savings from the polio vaccine, which was introduced in 1955, still produces a $30 billion savings per year, every year. \\n   Medical advances will help cut costs by reducing lost economic output from disability and premature death. For example, new treatments for AIDS--some developed with NIH-funded research--caused the mortality rate from AIDS to drop over 60 percent in the mid-1990s, thus allowing tens of thousands of Americans to continue contributing to our society and economy. \\n   And medical research spending isn't just about reducing the enormous current burdens of illness. The costs of illness may grow even higher if we fail to push ahead with further research. Infectious diseases, in particular, are continually creating new health costs. The recent emergence of Lyme disease, E. coli, and hantavirus, for example, show how nature continues to evolve new threats to health. In addition, dangerous bacteria are evolving at an alarming rate and grow resistant to every new round of antibiotics. \\n   This report extensively shows the benefits of medical research and reaffirms the enormous benefits we achieve from funding the National Institutes of Health in our fight against disease. But there is still a lot more work to be done. I am hopeful my colleagues will take a few moments to look at this report and recognize the important work done by the scientists and researchers at the NIH. It can be read in its entirety on the JEC website at: jec.senate.gov. \\n   Funding for NIH is really about-- hope and opportunity. The challenge before us is great, but America has always responded when our people are behind the challenge. America landed a man on the moon. We pioneered computer technology. America won the Cold War. Now it is time to win the war against the diseases that plague our society. We have the knowledge. We have the technology. Most important, we have the support of the American people. \\n   I ask my colleagues to join me in the effort to double funding for the National Institutes of Health. It's good economic policy, it's good public policy, and most importantly, it's good for all Americans. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000627\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support for the Everglades restoration bill introduced today by my friend, and chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator BOB SMITH. This bill represents a tremendous amount of effort and hard work and I am grateful to all my colleagues who have joined Senator GRAHAM and me in this effort. \\n   Today is an important day in the nearly twenty-year process of restoring America's Everglades. It is important because we are standing at last at the historic juncture between planning and action. It is important because now--at long last--we have a realistic chance of restoring, and protecting for future generations, a unique environmental treasure that is fractured, starved for water, and locked in a steady state of decline. And it is important because the bill we're introducing today represents the cumulative efforts of all those who did the work on the largest and most significant environmental restoration project in our nation's history. \\n   Why does this bill matter? Why are the Everglades deserving of Congress' time and effort? Let me offer a few reasons. This bill matters because in the last century a wonderful, pristine natural system in the heart of South Florida was systematically robbed of its beauty and uniqueness in the name of short-term human interest. This bill matters because the America's Everglades is a national treasure, unique in the world, and deserving of a better fate than what is currently written for it in the laws of this country. Our bill matters because we Floridians--after years of acrimony and conflicting goals--have come together behind a balanced plan that fully reconciles the needs of the natural system with those  of the existing water users. And the restoration matters--to us, as legislators--because past Congresses caused this problem, and we in our generation should fix it. \\n   It has been well documented how the Congress in 1948--acting under the pressures of the day--authorized the systematic destruction of the Everglades in the name of flood control, urban development, and agriculture. That is history and we cannot change that. Instead, we must respond to the needs and priorities of our own generation, and pass this good bill to restore America's Everglades. \\n   Let's be clear, Mr. President. Passing this bill, this year, is all that remains between the long years of study and the actual restoration of America's Everglades. The administration has done their part in devoting a tremendous amount of time and effort on the document before you. To Governor Bush's credit, the State of Florida has already written this plan into Florida's laws and arranged funding for Florida's share of the cost. There is only one task remaining: we in Congress must pass this plan, this year, and let the work of restoration begin. \\n   I urge my colleagues to join with me in supporting the bill we're introducing today. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000620\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I begin by saying to my friend, Senator DODD, how much I appreciate his comments at the beginning of his speech to the Senate. I appreciate the relationship we have developed. Certainly, one of the things I will truly miss as I leave the Senate at the end of this year is the relationships that have been developed and the opportunity to expand on those relationships with others. Again, it has been a delight. However, we do have very strong differences of opinion on this issue. \\n   I will begin by pointing at the chart that has been put up next to Senator DODD. There is one very fundamental difference. Each of those leaders reached out; they wanted to bring about change. We have seen absolutely, positively none of that from Fidel Castro. There is no indication--not an iota of evidence--that Fidel Castro wants to change. \\n   Later today, we will be voting on this amendment to the Defense Department authorization bill, which is designed to establish a commission to review and report on the United States policy toward Cuba. \\n   I have spoken with many colleagues recently about this amendment and the idea of forming a commission. I understand from some Senators that they have concerns that they want a chance to discuss regarding Cuba. But the goal of those Senators seems to be either broad sanctions reform or the enactment of specific changes in our policies toward Cuba. But today we are debating an amendment on forming a commission. \\n   This commission is blatantly political, in my opinion, so much so that no serious effort can come from a commission designed to be so skewed. This commission accomplishes nobody's goal. \\n   Let me make three points: First, we don't need a national commission to study only Cuba sanctions; second, we should not tie the hands of the next President to set his own Cuba policy; and, third, we should not set policy through a partisan commission outside of the normal conduct of foreign policy by the executive branch. \\n   The legislation on which you are being asked to vote establishes a 12-person panel to review and report on various aspects of Cuba policy. But this is why we have a Foreign Relations Committee in the Senate, an International Relations Committee in the House, and a U.S. Department of State. Why are we making Government bigger and more expensive than it needs to be? Especially, as my friend from Connecticut has argued, this amendment does not take a position or implement a policy.  \\n   Let me highlight a few of the details. This commission is appointed as follows--and, again, I note that my friend indicated this is not a partisan issue, but we who have been around here for a long time all know these issues end up being influenced by politics. \\n   What we are going to have is a commission of 12 people, 6 appointed by the current President. The current President will put six members on a commission to tell the next President what his policy toward Cuba should be. And there will be three from each House--two majority, one minority. That means two-thirds of the commission would be appointed by Democrats; that is, 8 of the 12 members of the commission would be appointed by Democrats. One-third, that is, four members of the commission, would be Republicans. That is not the way to set foreign policy. \\n   Our current policy, set by the State Department and the President, has been endorsed by the Congress over the years with significant legislation. The only reason for this special commission is to try to change current policy through abnormal means. \\n   Let me talk for a moment about American foreign policy in general. I hear the rhetoric often that, after 39 years, clearly, our Cuba policy has not brought democracy to Cuba and therefore it must be abandoned as a failure. Think about that argument for a moment. What if Ronald Reagan had come into office and declared in 1980: After 40 years, since there is no democracy in the Soviet Union, our Soviet policy must be abandoned? \\n   Reagan did the opposite. He had the courage to call the Soviet Union what it was, an ``evil empire.'' His courage and commitment brought democratic reform to Russia. America's foreign policy must reflect America's commitment to the principles we believe in: freedom, democracy, justice, and respect for human dignity. \\n   My friend from Connecticut has stated that the policy is aimed at one man, Fidel Castro, but it denies basic necessities to the entire 11 million people of Cuba. The reality is that Cuba can purchase goods from the entire world. By closing the American market to Cuba, we are denying the people nothing. Fidel Castro keeps Cuba poor, not the United States embargo. \\n   By maintaining the current policy, however, of isolating Fidel Castro, we are doing as a Nation what we have done for so many generations: We are standing shoulder to shoulder with \\n   people struggling for freedom. We are standing for truth and dignity and supporting heroes when we oppose Fidel Castro and deny him the means to build up his resources. \\n   Since trade has been an important issue of discussion lately given the pending vote on trade with China, perhaps some more detail would be helpful on the differences between China and Cuba. \\n   Simply stated, China began policy changes and economic reforms as early as 1978. Today, they continue to open their economy, seek engagement in the community of nations, and look for investment and trade. \\n   Let me tell you about Cuba. I will provide details from a study conducted by the University of Miami: Cuba does not permit trade independent from the state; most of Cuba's exportable products to the United States are produced by Cuban state-run enterprises with workers being paid near slave wages; many of these products would compete unfairly with United States agriculture and manufactured products, or with other products imported from the democratic countries of the Caribbean into the United States; Cuba does not permit individual freedom in economic matters; investments in Cuba are directed and approved by the Government of Cuba; it is illegal for foreign investors to hire or fire Cuban workers directly and the Cuban Ministry of Labor does the hiring; foreign companies must pay the wages owed to their employees directly to the Cuban Government in hard currency; the Cuban Government then pays the workers in Cuban pesos, worth one-twentieth of a dollar, and the Government pockets 90 percent of the wages paid in by the investor; Cuba has no independent judicial system to settle commercial disputes. \\n   In short, Fidel Castro has failed to make any of the changes made by Beijing. An investment in China today can empower a Chinese middle class and move power away from the center. An investment in Cuba today benefits Fidel Castro and disadvantages the 11 million people struggling for freedom. It is that simple. \\n   As recently as 1997, Fidel Castro argued against the wisdom of economic reforms and reasserted the supremacy of Communist ideology. In addition, political parties remain outlawed. Dissidents are either exiled, banished to the far reaches of the island, or simply imprisoned. The church continues to complain that the promises made during the Pope's visit have not been complied with. The daily activities of the average Cuban citizen continue to be monitored by the state's notorious ``neighborhood watch committees,'' known as the Committee for the Defense of the Revolution. These have been in place for 40 years and continue in place today. Amnesty International counts at least 400 prisoners of conscience, but this does not include the thousands convicted under trumped up charges for political purposes. \\n   I am not simply arguing ideology here today. We have empirical evidence of the failure of the policy recommendation to trade with Cuba; we need only to look at Canada's recent experiences. After arguing for a policy of opening trade with Cuba, our neighbors to the North are now pulling out. I will quote from The Globe and Mail of June 30, 1999:  \\n   The Canadian government had hoped that investing directly in the Cuban economy by building plants and infrastructure would not only deliver an economic return, but also lead to wider-ranging reforms. Those hopes have been largely dashed as Canadian companies report woeful tales of pouring good money into bad investments in Cuba.  \\n   Mr. President, policies of so-called engagement with Castro have failed for those who have tried. We all shared great hope when the Pope visited Cuba in January 1998. The United States promised to respond positively to any changes made by the Castro regime following the Pope's visit. We expected to see more space for the Cuban people: freedom of speech and more freedom of religious expression. We know now that even these hopes have been dashed. The Pope just last December expressed his disappointment in the changes in Cuba. A December 2, 1999 Reuters wire story reports,  \\n   The clear wording of the Pope's speech indicated that the Vatican felt that not much has changed on the predominantly Catholic island in two years.  \\n   We know that President Reagan's wisdom remains true--after 39 years of isolating Cuba, we must not fear calling things as we see them. Fidel Castro is an evil tyrant. He impoverishes the Cuban people in spite of the efforts of many to open the society to freedom and the economy to investment. Fidel Castro denies his people the basic necessities for life, liberty, and happiness. \\n   Mr. President, I do not object to evaluating our policies, but we must be honest, this is not the way. When Cuba changes, the United States must also change. Until then, we must remain committed to our principles, because it is our principles which make us strong. No missile system, no fleet of warships, will keep the United States the shining city on the hill--the beacon of freedom which we all saw when Ronald Reagan was President. I hope that my colleagues will join me. And I hope that they will stand with me for freedom. stand with me for democracy, stand with me for justice, and stand with me for respect for the human dignity of the 11 million people in Cuba. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-20000620\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I merely seek recognition to move to table the Dodd amendment No. 3475, and I ask for the yeas and nays. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-3-20000620\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I understand that vote will take place at 3:15 p.m. among three stacked votes, I believe. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000620\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote to table this amendment. It is blatantly political in its nature. Of the 12 positions, 8 will be determined by the Democratic Party and 4 by the Republicans; 6 by the President, 2 by the majority in each of the Houses, 1 by the  minority in each. That is 8 of 12--two-thirds. \\n   We should not, today, be telling the next President of the United States what his policy should be with respect to Cuba. This Congress and this President should not be doing that. \\n   Third, I only had the opportunity to speak with Frank Carlucci and Howard Baker. While they accept the concept of a commission, they don't support one that is so blatantly political, and they don't support one being established at this time. \\n   I ask my colleagues to vote against this amendment, and I move to table the amendment. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000616\\n\\n    Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a common sense piece of legislation that would prohibit the rescheduling or forgiveness of any outstanding bilateral debt owed to the United States by the Government of the Russian Federation until the President of the United States certifies to the Congress that Russia has ceased all operations and permanently closed its intelligence facility at Lourdes, Cuba. Currently the Government of the Russian Federation maintains a signals intelligence facility in Lourdes, Cuba from which it conducts intelligence activities directed against the United States. The Secretary of Defense has reported that the Russian Federation leases the Lourdes facility for an estimated $100 to $300 million every year. This is several hundred million dollars flowing to support a brutal tyrant for the purpose of supporting espionage. \\n   Mr. President, the United States should prohibit debt rescheduling and forgiveness for a country that is conducting espionage activities against America, while infusing Castro's despotic government with between $100 million and $300 million per year. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000612\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise with my friend and colleague Senator GRAHAM to introduce the Florida Keys Water Quality Improvements Act. This bill is identical to legislation that passed the House on May 4, 2000 by a vote of 411-7, and would provide Federal resources to help improve and maintain one of our Nation's real treasures, the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. \\n   The Florida Keys are a spectacular natural resource of international significance. Within the Florida Keys lies the only living coral reef bed in the United States and the third largest living coral reef in the world. The reef is home to plants and animals unique to this area and that comprise a rare and sensitive ecosystem at the southern end of the Everglades ecosystem. While the spectacular coral reef is the Keys' most popular feature, they are also known for native seagrass beds, lush tropical hardwood hammocks, mangrove forests, rocky pinelands, the endangered key deer, and a wide array of aquatic life. \\n   The Florida Keys marine ecosystem is dependent upon clean, clear water with low nutrient levels for its survival. Water quality experts have found that the inadequate wastewater treatment and storm water management systems are major contributors of pollution in the nearby waters off the Florida Keys. This increased pollution has had devastating effects on the marine environment, and is threatening the reefs on the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. Unless decisive action is taken to stop the flow of pollution, scientists warn the ecosystem will continue its decline towards total collapse. \\n   The source of the problem is clear. The Keys have almost no water quality infrastructure. Lacking adequate technology, untreated wastewater now travels easily through porous limestone rock into the near-shore waters. Polluted stormwater also flows from developed land into the same near-shore waters. \\n   Our bill is a natural extension of the Federal commitment to the Florida Keys made under the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary Protection Act approved by Congress in 1990. This legislation established a Federal role in the research and protection of the Keys marine ecosystem. The Act directed the Environmental Protection Agency and the State of Florida to establish a Water Quality Steering Committee which was charged with developing a comprehensive water quality protection program. In fulfilling this directive, the steering committee worked closely with dedicated citizens, scientists, and technical experts. In the final analysis, it found that inadequate wastewater and stormwater systems are the single largest source of pollution in the Keys. \\n   This bill authorizes Federal assistance to help local officials afford the necessary improvements to protect the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. It establishes a grant program under the Environmental Protection Agency for the construction of treatment works projects aimed at improving the water quality of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. The administrator of EPA, after consultation with State and local officials, would be authorized to fund treatment works projects that comply or are consistent with local growth ordinances, plans and agreements, as well as current water quality standards. Projects funded under this program would be cost-shared, with local sponsors providing a minimum of 25 percent of the project costs. \\n   This bill authorizes $213 million in Federal funding for the deployment of water quality technology throughout the Keys. To make the necessary wastewater improvements, the estimated cost to improve near-shore water quality in the Florida Keys is between $184 million and $418 million. To make the necessary storm water management improvements, the estimated cost is between $370 million and $680 million. The Federal government is not going to bear the entire cost, even though this is a national resource. The State of Florida is obligated to come up with 25 percent cost share. \\n   Moneys authorized by this bill will be utilized to replace the dated, inefficient system of sludge ponds and septic tanks currently being used in the Keys with modern waste and storm water treatment works. By ensuring that the nutrients associated with such wastes are not discharged or released into the surrounding waters, we can prevent further damage to the marine environment and achieve dramatic improvement to the water quality in the National Marine Sanctuary. \\n   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this reasonable approach to maintaining an essential national resource. I hope there will be a broad, bipartisan support for this bill.  \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000524\\n\\n    Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000515\\n\\n    Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation I am introducing today with my colleague, Senator BREAUX, be printed in the RECORD. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000504\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I am glad to let my colleague go first. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-20000504\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, let me make just a couple of comments before I give my prepared remarks. \\n   It is interesting how this debate is being engaged rather vigorously so quickly and so early this morning. I remind my colleagues that this is basically this same amendment that was adopted by the Senate 63-35 in the last Congress. \\n   I imagine the reason for it is that all of my colleagues received a letter from the National Education Association, the teachers union, in opposition to this amendment. This letter from the National Education Association on behalf of its 2.5 million members strongly urges opposition to the amendment offered by Senator ABRAHAM and myself. They are opposed to it because it authorizes ``federal funds for [the purpose of] testing of current teachers, tenure reform, and merit pay.'' \\n   I find it interesting that the NEA previously came out in support of testing--NEA President Bob Chase has said the NEA:  \\n   ......wholeheartedly supports and endorses the recommendations of the National Commission on Teaching and America's Future's new report, ``Doing What Matters Most: Investing in Quality Teaching.''  \\n   The report recommends: Teachers should be licensed based on demonstrated performance, including tests of subject matter knowledge, teaching knowledge, and teaching skill. \\n   The report recommends: To encourage and reward teacher knowledge and skill, we should develop a career continuum for teaching linked to assessments and compensation systems that reward knowledge and skill. \\n   That sounds to me like a broad endorsement of the concept of testing teachers to understand where they are with respect to the knowledge they have in the courses they are going to be teaching. I think it clearly indicates the idea of moving away from pay being based on someone's seniority to one based on merit--pay should be based on the ability to teach, the ability to be able to show, in testing, that they have the knowledge in the areas in which they are teaching. \\n   So I make that comment to begin. \\n   Further, with respect to questions about merit pay, again, my colleague already referred to the fact there have been States experimenting with this idea since the late 1960s. But Denver, CO, has a merit pay system. Interestingly enough, the Secretary of Education, Secretary Riley, when he was Governor of South Carolina, endorsed merit pay. \\n   In Florida, we encourage teachers to participate in what I believe is the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards. If a teacher in the State of Florida successfully completes that process and becomes certified by this board, they are going to receive a bonus. I think that is merit pay. \\n   So this idea that I think the Senator from Massachusetts tried to imply, that this is something no one is pursuing and there is no value to it, I would say, is not accurate. \\n   Mr. President, I rise today with my friend and colleague, Senator ABRAHAM, to offer this critically important amendment. It focuses on the single most important, yet most overlooked, aspect of education--the quality of America's teachers. \\n   Education is the engine of social and economic progress, and the ladder of opportunity. The rungs of that ladder must be supported by exceptional teachers. I have little doubt that the American spirit of ingenuity and innovation will continue to lead the world in providing new economic opportunities, expanding medical research and improving the quality of life for everyone. But there is a catch. For our children and grandchildren to achieve the high standards we expect of them, we must provide them with the tools they need to help them excel. The economic security of our children depends upon the quality of their education. \\n   Each time we debate education reform in America, there is a growing sentiment that continued viability of the American dream could slip away simply because our children are unprepared to face tomorrow's challenges. The academic performance of America's students in international exams can hardly be considered world class. In fact, the longer our students attend American schools, the further behind they fall in performance. Consider these statistics: \\n   While America's 4th graders score above the international average in math tests, they continue to trail students in countries like Austria, the Czech Republic, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, and Singapore. By the 8th grade, American students barely meet the international average, and by the 12th grade, American students lag far behind their international peers. \\n   In science, U.S. students score above the international average in both 4th and 8th grades. But, in 4th grade, U.S. students are outranked by only one country--Korea. By the 8th grade, thirteen countries outrank U.S. students. \\n   Again, that is an indication that the longer they are in school, the further behind they fall with other countries in the world. \\n   In international physics tests, American 12th graders ranked sixteenth, and far behind countries like Russia, Slovenia, Latvia and the Czech Republic. \\n   In both math and science, the performance of U.S. 12th graders is among the lowest in the industrialized world. Of the 21 countries that participate, the United States placed 16th in science and 19th in math skills. \\n   Our students will be denied basic opportunities because they have not been adequately equipped to face a new, competitive, and global economy. We can and must do better. \\n   Without qualified teachers in America's classrooms, all other attempts at reform are meaningless. We have long focused on the need to hire more teachers--as many as two million over the next decade. Our focus shouldn't be on the number of teachers, but rather, on the quality of those teachers. \\n   As long as students are compelled to attend school, we should be compelled to staff those \\n   schools with the best and brightest teachers. Parents all over the state of Florida, and I imagine the same is true around the country, are concerned that the success--or failure--of their child's entire academic year will be determined by the quality and expertise of their child's teacher. Studies show that the most important factor in determining student success on standardized tests is the teacher's ability to present the material. As States are taking important steps to challenge their students with high-stakes tests for promotion and graduation, we must encourage states to step up to the plate and provide students with teachers who are better prepared than ever before. \\n   Further complicating the situation is the shortage of teachers nationwide, which has led many school districts to assign teachers to subjects for which they have no formal training. Four million American students are currently being taught English, Math, or History by teachers who have neither a college major or minor in the subject they are teaching. Four million kids! \\n   Mr. President, maybe I have a slightly different perspective in looking at these numbers today than I would have, say, 5 or 6 weeks ago. Priscilla and I were just blessed with our first granddaughter. We already have three grandsons, but this is our first granddaughter. While all of us in the family are engaged in the early days of raising that little baby and trying to get through the night, we are also concerned about the future for little Addison. Is she going to be among the one out of five students in America being taught English by a teacher who doesn't have a major or minor in English?  \\n   Think about that for a moment. I think one out of four math students are being taught by teachers who do not have a minor or major in that subject. So when I think about little Addison's future, and I realize the competitive world in which we live today, and how much more competitive it is going to be in the future, I know she is not going to be able to compete and have the same opportunities we all have enjoyed if she doesn't have an education second to none. Frankly, that can only come about as a result of having high-quality teachers in the classroom--teachers who my son and his wife, Ann, can be comfortable in knowing have the knowledge and expertise to provide that education. \\n   Requiring secondary school teachers to earn a major or minor in their subjects might make sense if there were not a clearly superior policy that could be adopted instead, such as requiring teachers to pass a subject knowledge test for the subject areas they teach. \\n   Teacher testing is an important first step toward upgrading the quality of instruction in the classroom. Testing provides a valuable opportunity for teachers to demonstrate knowledge of subjects for which they do not hold a major or minor degree. It will also enable principals to evaluate their staffing needs and to staff classrooms with the most qualified teachers. You simply \\n   can not teach what you don't know. \\n   Common sense also dictates that we should not focus solely on under-performing teachers. We must also recognize that there are many great teachers who are successfully challenging their students on a daily basis. Teaching is one of the most important and challenging professions. While many excellent, enthusiastic, and well prepared teachers already work in America's schools, their work often goes unrecognized and unrewarded. Salaries for teachers lag far behind other professions for which a college degree is expected or required, and as a result, many exceptional teachers leave the profession and others who would be exceptional teachers never even consider teaching. \\n   We have created a system of clear incentives for our best teachers to leave the classroom. Instead, we should be enacting policies to keep the best and brightest teachers in the classroom. To do this, we need to evaluate and reward teachers with a compensation system that supports and encourages them to strengthen their skills and demonstrate high levels of performance. That, in turn, will enhance learning for all children. \\n   Today, schools compensate teachers based almost solely on seniority, not on their performance inside the classroom. It rewards underperforming teachers and penalizes exceptional ones by grouping them together in a single pay scale based primarily upon length of service. Merit-pay would differentiate between teachers who are hard-working and inspiring, and those who fall short. It is true that good teachers cost money. But the fact is, bad teachers can cost more because they limit the education of a child and his or her ability to contribute to society. \\n   We hear quite often that merit pay won't work in public schools because it is too difficult to compare the accomplishments between teachers teaching smart, wealthy, well-disciplined, well-fed children versus those teaching poor, inattentive, hungry and unruly children. These conditions are no different than the differences faced by other professionals like doctors or lawyers who face both unwinnable cases or deadly diseases. Teachers should also be rewarded proportionately to their accomplishments in enhancing student learning, attitudes, and behavior. \\n   This is not to suggest that simply throwing more money at schools and teachers will rescue schools from mediocrity. Some suggest we try throwing more money at the problem, although I would point out that we have already tried that. The United States spends more money per pupil than any other industrialized nation, and as I mentioned earlier, our children are not achieving high levels of performance on international standardized exams. The reality is that no amount of money will save mismanaged, bureaucratic, red-tape ridden schools from failure. And no amount of money will rescue a student who is placed in a classroom led by an unprepared, unenthusiastic, and uninspiring teacher. This debate is less about money and more about giving teachers a greater stake in the education they provide. We can do this by offering them real incentives to do their best so that their dedication and expertise will be recognized and rewarded. This will benefit all students. \\n   Our amendment, known as the MERIT Act, will enable states to use their limited federal dollars on a number of initiatives to enhance teacher quality. First, this amendment provides funding for states to develop rigorous exams to periodically test elementary and secondary school teachers on their knowledge of the subjects they are teaching. Secondly, this amendment provides funding to states to establish compensation systems for teachers based upon merit and proven performance. Finally, this amendment provides states with resources to reform current tenure programs. \\n   This broad approach will enable states to staff their schools with the best and most qualified teachers, thereby enhancing learning for all students. In turn, teachers can be certain that all of their energy, dedication and expertise will be rewarded. And it will be done without placing new mandates on states or increasing the federal bureaucracy. \\n   Last Congress, the Senate passed a similar amendment with bipartisan support by a vote of 63-35 during debate on the Education Savings Account legislation. Unfortunately, the President vetoed that bill, despite his previous support for teacher testing. \\n   I look forward to working with my colleagues as we continue the fight to give dedicated professionals, who teach our children, a personal stake in the quality of the instruction they provide. I hope there will again be broad, bipartisan support for this amendment. I thank the chair and I yield the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-3-20000504\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, that is a story I remember very well. To cut it short takes away, I think, the strength of its message. So maybe a little bit later on in the debate we can discuss it, but I would be glad to yield the time back to the Senator so she can continue. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-4-20000504\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I thank the Senator for the opportunity to do this. A number of years ago, my wife and I visited a school called the Marcus Garvey School in Los Angeles. I went there because I was trying to learn more about the different types of schools in America--what works, what does not work. While I am going to be talking about the Marcus Garvey School, I am not endorsing or embracing everything the school does. But the thing that stood out to me was the role of the teacher in this school. So this is what happened. \\n   I went to the Marcus Garvey School and met the administrator, the principal, the owner of the school--all one person, Anyim Palmer, who was in a room probably no bigger than 10 by 10, filled with furniture that was probably 35 or 40 years old. The phone was on a stack of papers. There was no secretary. When the phone rang, he answered it. The point I am making is there were not a lot of amenities. This is basic stuff. This is a building with rooms in it, an administrator, teachers, and students. \\n   He said: I want to take you down and show you what some of our students are doing. Unfortunately, the school is not filled today because of the time of the year it is. \\n   Priscilla and I went down to a room where there were three different groups of children being taught in the same room. The first group of students we saw were 2-year-old children. Again, I emphasize 2-year-olds, not second graders; 2-year-old children. There were eight of them sitting at a little table. The teacher said to the children: Show the Senator and Mrs. Mack how you can say your ABCs. You can imagine the cute little voices of those children as they recited their ABCs. When they finished that, the teacher said: Now that you have done it in English, do it in Spanish. So then these little 2-year-old children went through their alphabet in Spanish. When they finished that, the teacher then said to them: Now do the alphabet in Swahili, and they did that as well--2 years old. \\n   We went across the room to where 3-year-old children were doing math problems. The teacher said to me: Give one of the students a math problem. As I would suspect most people would have done, I gave a problem such as 5 plus 8--you know, pretty straightforward. But, again, 3 years old. She  said: No, no, no, give them a tough problem. So I said something like 325 plus 182. And this 3-year-old child, standing at the board, put down little dots, wrote down a number, another series of dots, wrote down a number and got the right answer at 3-years-old. \\n   We went across the room where 4-year-old children were reading. We were told that these children were reading at the second, third, and fourth grade level. They were 4 years old. \\n   We went into another room in this facility where there were 5-year-old children. A little boy was asked to stand up and recite for me, in the proper chronological order, every President of the United States. That little fellow stood up, looked me right in the eyes, and he rattled right through every President of the United States in the proper order. I must admit I knew he did that because they gave me a cheat sheet to look at. He was 5 years old. \\n   Every time we went to a different area and saw these students, these children at work, Priscilla and I would say to this person who was taking us around: How can this be? How can this possibly be? What makes this work? Every single time we asked the question, the answer was: It is the teacher. It is \\n   the teacher. It is the teacher. \\n   Anyim Palmer challenged what was then considered the best private school in Los Angeles County, their sixth grade against his third grade students. I think it was in math and English. You know who won--Anyim Palmer's third grade beat the sixth graders. How did he do it? What he said to me was: It was the teacher. \\n   What I found out later is Anyim Palmer was a public school teacher in California who became so frustrated and angry that the system was failing to teach children in his community that he quit the public schools and started his own school. Do you know what he did? He also trained his own teachers. He said: Forget everything you have learned. I am going to train you. I am going to teach you how to teach. \\n   Again, I thank the Senator for asking me to restate that story. It made a major impression on me. We can talk about all these other things, but we must focus on how to make sure that the teacher standing up in front of our children and grandchildren has the knowledge in the subject they are teaching--this is not fancy. We are not asking for special degrees. I am asking a very simple question. If a teacher is standing in front of my little granddaughter, Addison, a few years from now, I want my son and his wife to know the person who is teaching their little daughter has the knowledge in the subject they are teaching. That does not seem to be an unreasonable request to make. \\n   I thank the Senator for asking the question. I yield. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-5-20000504\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I say to the Senator he is exactly right, there is no mandate. As strongly as I feel about it, I would like to, but I do not think that is our role. I think we can make some serious mistakes by mandating certain things, to say to a particular school district or a particular State they have to do what I say. They might say, what if we put this kind of testing program into effect but our concern is we need more computers. We need more books. We need--whatever. \\n   This is not a mandate. It never has been a mandate. It never will be a mandate, at least as far as the Senator from Michigan and I are concerned. It is merely a statement of importance and it says to the schools if they want to, these dollars can be used for the purpose of developing the concepts for creating tests, developing some merit pay program, or in reforming tenure, all three of which we think can in fact go to the heart of the matter about what is necessary to improve the ability of the teacher. \\n   The inference was made earlier that somehow or another those of us who are talking about this are out to degrade the teachers in this country. That is absolutely a false challenge. Most of us can remember those teachers who made a difference in our lives, who challenged us, who demanded from us that we do better. Each of us responded in a little bit different way. But we understand the importance of having good, quality teachers, and there are a lot of them. That is why we put the merit pay in, to recognize that. \\n   Again, as to this notion that somehow or another if we were to put in place a merit pay system that, highlights teachers who are doing well, and encourages those who are not teaching our children to do better and somehow or another people would know and there would be divisions that would take place, let me tell you something. There is probably not a school in America where every teacher doesn't know who is carrying the load and who is not. You do not need a merit pay program for students and teachers alike to know who the good teachers are. You can just hear the kids talking about it: Boy, I hope I don't get in so-and-so's class. \\n   It doesn't take a merit program. Merit pay is not going to do that. Children and parents already know the good ones and those who are not carrying their load. \\n   What we are trying to do is the right thing. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-6-20000504\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I certainly hope it would do that. I believe it would. As both of us have indicated, the State of Florida has developed a program that provides an incentive for teachers to get certification by a national board. If they receive that certification, they get a bonus. \\n   They also get a bonus if they encourage another teacher to do the same thing. \\n   What we are saying is, we are recognizing, not only through the dollars but through our interest, the importance of that individual teacher and the importance of the quality of that individual teacher. I believe it would encourage them to stay in the system longer. Most of the teachers love the children they are teaching. They want them to do better. We just need to give more encouragement to those teachers. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-7-20000504\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I suggest the absence of a quorum. \\n   Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-8-20000504\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I suggest the absence of a quorum.  \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000426\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000426\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, in the early morning hours of Holy Saturday, a little piece of America died. America's shining beacon of freedom faded in the Florida sky as many of us grieved over the astounding actions of the United States Government. This administration betrayed America's past and joined history's inglorious list of governments that have chosen to use excessive force against its own law-abiding citizens. \\n   Our founding fathers believed in a Government of, for, and by, the people, a Government designed to serve and benefit the people, not to serve and benefit the needs of Government, and certainly not to substitute brute force for the rule of law. These are reminiscent of the tactics used by tyrants and despots. The decisions by this administration that led to the events of last Saturday will be remembered as a day of shame in our American history. \\n   My comments today are not directed toward the law enforcement officers who carried out the operation; I understand they are charged with a duty and must follow the directives of the Attorney General and the President of the United States. My comments today are not directed at the ultimate disposition of Elian's residency or custody, and they are not intended to be partisan or political, but they do go directly to the heart of who we are as a Nation and what we expect of our Government. \\n   As most people know, the Elian Gonzalez matter is pending in Federal court. Just last Wednesday, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals ordered that Elian Gonzalez must remain in the United States during the review of his Federal court case. The opinion of the court suggests the INS and the Department of Justice were wrong in not granting Elian an asylum hearing. In the final footnote of the opinion, the court encouraged the parties to avail themselves voluntarily of the Eleventh Circuit's mediation services. The court believed that mediation was an appropriate avenue to resolve this heart gripping situation. \\n   The Attorney General did not listen to the court. She was obsessed with reuniting Elian with his father at any cost. Perhaps she would have been wise to listen to the words of Daniel Webster: ``Liberty exists in proportion to wholesome restraint.'' Perhaps she should have listened to her own words: ``I'm trying to work through an extraordinary human tragedy. And the importance of working through it is that we do so in good faith, without violence, without having to cause further disruption to the little boy.'' This statement was made nine days before the raid. \\n   The night before the raid, mediation between the Department of Justice, the Miami family and Juan Miguel Gonzalez had gone on all night and into the wee hours of Saturday morning. Even as the negotiations continued on the telephone with all parties, agents of the administration dressed in fatigues and masks exploded into the home of Lazaro Gonzalez with machine guns drawn--and one machine gun that was pointed dramatically in the face of a screaming child. \\n   The Government held all the power, and the Government used intimidation to force a family, a loving caring family, into a corner. Remember this is the family originally selected by the Attorney General to care for Elian. \\n   The administration offered ultimatums when fair mediation was needed. This administration resorted to the power of a machine gun to intimidate an American family. What possible benefit could come from this act? \\n   Tactics such as these deserve a full explanation. \\n   Why would the Department of Justice stage a raid when mediator Aaron Podhurst stated that a deal between the parties was ``minutes to an hour away''? Why would they be so impatient with a solution so near? The Attorney General said that they had a window during which to conduct the raid of Saturday through Monday. Why could they not have waited for negotiations to play out. \\n   What credible information existed to suggest this level of force needed to be used? \\n   Another question that deserves fuller explanation speaks to the impact of the raid on the boy. Wouldn't any psychologist or psychiatrist who actually examined the child say this action would further traumatize the boy? But sadly, the INS team of experts never did examine the boy to make an informed evaluation. \\n   How could such tactics possibly be in the best interests of a child who has suffered so much? What right did this administration have to add this trauma to the terrible loss Elian has already suffered? And why did he have to suffer at the hands of the people who are supposed to defend the rule of law, the INS, the DoJ, and the President of the United States. \\n   Let's think for a moment about the decision the father and the Justice Department made in putting Elian's life at risk with the plans for the pre-dawn raid. I have never questioned the father's love for the boy, but I cannot imagine any father would choose to put his son's life at risk a second time. But it is not an unloving father who put his son in harm's way-the father is as much a victim as Elian in many ways. The father had a simple choice: travel to a safe house in Miami and have Elian voluntarily transferred into his custody or insist on remaining in Washington and have the U.S. government seize his son in a violent, dangerous raid. Just as it wasn't the father's decision not to come to his boy's side for the first four months of this ordeal, it was not his decision to remain in Washington, forcing a raid at gunpoint. Castro would not allow the father to travel then and he would not allow him to travel last weekend. \\n   President Clinton promised my colleague Senator GRAHAM that Elian would not be seized in the middle of the night, and now we must ask again, why did he promise one thing and yet do another? \\n   Elian deserves access to all of his legal options, Elian deserves an asylum hearing, and he deserves the protection of U.S. law. Yet that is for another day. The use of force must be dealt with today. Does the end justify the means? Will these means ever be justified? \\n   There have been accusations of playing politics with this issue. \\n   But perhaps we ought to recognize what several of the Attorney General's long-time supporters have said. The four mediators from Miami that were involved in the negotiations with Janet Reno have clearly challenged the administration's characterization of the events of last Saturday. They said they were close to an agreement and felt confident a peaceful solution could have been reached. \\n   We cannot simply sweep these issues away and dispense of them in the name of politics. This is a long, sad story and I'm sure many would wish it would simply fade away. But if we accept and commend the actions of our government for acting hastily in choosing excessive force over peaceful mediation, we have traveled down a very troubling road. We dare not condone such use of force to settle legal disputes. This strikes at the very heart of the balance of power and the integrity of our judicial process. \\n   This child and no child should face the intimidation and trauma of an automatic weapon in his face--especially when perpetrated by the American government--a government that has always stood for freedom and human rights throughout the world. As a father and grandfather, I am heartbroken for the frightened, vulnerable child in that photograph. My hope is that no other administration official utter the words, ``I am proud of what we did'' and instead express regret and sorrow for the trauma and pain suffered by the entire Gonzalez family. \\n   What happened saddens me as an American, a father, and a Senator. Mr. President, last Saturday morning, a little bit of America died in that raid and I hope we never again dim the light of freedom for those who look to us for hope. I yield the floor. \\n   I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-20000426\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000426\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 297, submitted earlier by Senator LOTT and Senator DASCHLE. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-20000426\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and a statement of explanation appear at the appropriate place in the RECORD. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000426\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until the hour of 9:30 a.m. on Thursday, April 27. I further ask consent that on Thursday, immediately following the prayer, the Journal of the proceedings be approved to date, the morning hour be deemed to have expired, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and the Senate then begin a period of morning business until 12 noon with Senators speaking for up to 5 minutes each, with the following exceptions: Senator LOTT, or his designee, from 9:30 a.m. to 10 a.m.; Senator DURBIN, or his designee, from 10 a.m. to 10:30 a.m.; Senator HUTCHISON of Texas for up to 30 minutes; Senator DASCHLE, or his designee, for up to 45 minutes; Senator THOMAS, or his designee, for up to 15 minutes. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-20000426\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that at 12 noon the Senate proceed to the cloture vote relative to the marriage tax penalty bill. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000426\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, tomorrow morning, following the period of morning business, the Senate will conduct a cloture vote relative to the marriage tax penalty bill. If cloture is invoked, the Senate will remain on the bill under the provisions of rule XXII. Senators are reminded that second-degree amendments must be filed at the desk by 11 a.m. Thursday, under rule XXII. However, if cloture is not invoked, the Senate will resume debate on the motion to proceed to S.J. Res. 3, proposing an amendment to the Constitution to protect the rights of victims. It is hoped that the Senate will be able to proceed to that bill at a reasonable hour tomorrow. \\n   As a reminder, the Senate did receive the veto message with regard to the nuclear waste bill during today's session. By previous consent, debate on the veto override will begin on Tuesday, May 2, at 9:30 a.m., with a vote to occur at 3:15 that afternoon. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000426\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, if there is no further business to come before the Senate, I now ask unanimous consent that the Senate stand in adjournment under the previous order. \\n   There being no objection, the Senate, at 5:40 p.m., adjourned until Thursday, April 27, 2000, at 9:30 a.m. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000425\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of Senate Resolution 287, expressing the sense of the Senate regarding U.S. policy toward Libya. It is of grave concern to me that the United States is currently considering a change in its ``Travel Ban'' policy with Libya, prior to the resolution of the Pan-Am 103 Bombing trial. \\n   Libya is a state sponsor of terrorism and a global agent of instability. Two Libyan intelligence operatives, with prior terrorist activity convictions, are now on trial for the explosion of Pan Am flight 103 in 1988 and the loss of 270 lives, 180 of them Americans. Libya is engaged in one the most advanced Bio-Chemical efforts in the third world, including the acquisition of delivery vehicles. It has repeatedly engaged U.S. military forces, including an attempted missile attack on U.S. military installations in Italy in 1986. \\n   Taking into account its past behavior, we all agree that Libya has a long way to go to become a member of the family of law-abiding nations. Libya must take concrete actions to provide its sincerity. It must show complete adherence to the Pan Am 103 Judicial Authorities in Hague. If a conviction is reached, Libya must accept responsibility for any court judgement and make full payment to all judgement creditors. It is my sense that Libya must prove its vigilant and sincere cooperation in anti-terrorism efforts. \\n   U.S. policy towards Libya must remain balanced. The ``Travel Ban'' is an important tool and should not be abandoned without clear justification. A verdict is not yet at hand; I urge you to await the conclusion of the Pan Am 103 trial, and calculate our steps from there. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000413\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I hope that our colleagues across the aisle will not prevent us from reducing the marriage penalties in the tax code. This bill will provide married couples the relief that President Clinton denied them last year with his veto of the Taxpayer Refund and Relief Act of 1999. President Clinton's action last year increased taxes by close to $800 billion and imposed a marriage penalty on middle class American families. \\n   There is no place in the tax code for marriage penalties. Marriage penalties are caused by tax laws that treat joint filers relatively worse than single filers with half the income. It has of late become common practice to use the tax code for purposes of social engineering, discouraging some actions with the stick of tax penalties and encouraging others with the carrot of tax preferences. But there is no legitimate policy reason for punishing taxpayers with higher taxes just because they happen to be married. The marriage penalties in the tax code undermine the family, the institution that is the foundation of our society. \\n   I view this bill as just a start. Our tax code will not truly be family-friendly until every single marriage penalty is rooted out and eliminated, so that married couples with twice the income of single individuals are taxed at the same rates, and are eligible for the same tax preferences--including deductions, exemptions, use of IRAs and other savings vehicles--as those single filers. This bill is an important step toward that ultimate goal. \\n   The Democrat criticisms of our bill are misplaced. They argue that our bill contains complicated phase-ins, in contrast to their simple approach. But anyone who reads the bill and their alternative would see that this is false. The Finance Committee bill contains percentages in it, sure enough. And it phases in the relief, that is true. But the percentages and the phase-ins are instructions to the Treasury and the IRS, to make adjustments to the tax brackets. The only people who have to make any new calculations under the Finance Committee bill are the bureaucrats who make up the tax tables, not the taxpayer. \\n   By contrast, the Democrat alternative, in phasing in its relief, requires  taxpayers to calculate their taxes as joint filers, then calculate their taxes as if they were single--a complicated process that requires the allocation of various deductions and credits. Next, the taxpayer would have to determine the difference between these two calculations and then reduce this by a certain percentage. That is supposed to be simple? The Democrat substitute adds to the headaches of tax filing and the demand for tax preparers and tax preparation software. \\n   The Democrats also complain that the Finance Committee bill does more than address their narrow definition of the marriage penalty. They invoke the so-called ``marriage bonus.'' But the ``marriage bonus'' is a red herring. What they call a ``marriage bonus'' results from adjustment tax brackets for joint filers to reflect the fact that two adults are sharing the household income. Under the Democrat approach, single taxpayers who marry a non-working or low-earning spouse should pay the same amount of taxes as when they were single, even though this income must be spread over the needs of two adults. \\n   This approach is fundamentally flawed. The Democrat approach would enshrine in the law a new, ``homemaker penalty.'' The Democrats would make families with one earner and one stay-at-home spouse pay higher taxes than families with the same household income and two earners. \\n   But why discriminate against one-earner families? Why would we want a tax code that penalized families just because one of the spouses chooses the hard work of the household over the role of breadwinner? The Democrat alternative discourages parents from staying home with their infant children, and penalizes people who sacrifice income in order that they can care for their elderly parents. That is just plain wrong. \\n   The Finance Committee bill reduces the marriage penalty in a rational sensible way, by making the standard deduction for joint filers twice what it is for single filers, and by making the ranges at which income is taxed at the 15% and 28% rates twice for joint filers what they are for single filers. This recognizes that marriage is a partnership in which two adults share the household income. Our approach cuts taxes for all American families. The Democrats call this a ``bonus.'' We calm it common sense. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000413\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I come to the floor of the Senate today to tell a story--a modern day tragedy about a mother, Elizabeth, who so loved her son, Elian, that she tried to bring him to the shores of the United States of America from Cuba--to the shores of freedom. Had she succeeded, she would have joined her family members already in the United States: her cousin  who arrived only last year; her son's great uncle and his family who have been in the United States for many years; and another cousin who has been here for over fifteen years. She would have been reunited with many other relatives who must today remain anonymous for fear of retribution by Castro against those still trapped in Cuba. Instead, she met with tragedy in the Florida straits. Elizabeth died. Her five-year-old son survived. \\n   Let me be a little more specific. On November 21, 1999, a group of 14 Cuban citizens boarded a boat bound for the United States and the shores of freedom. The motor failed shortly after departing and the group was forced to return to Cuba. Think of the anxiety at this moment, having to return after risking everything. The anticipation. The disappointment. The fear. \\n   When the boat returned to Cuba, one of the other female passengers, Arianne Horta, placed her young daughter back on the shore of Cuba. She then wanted to make sure that Elizabeth was positive in her decision to take Elian. And despite the fact that Elian had a father in Cuba, Elizabeth brought her son back on the boat to set sail for the second time that night--seeking freedom on the shores of America. \\n   If you are interested in what Elian's mother really wanted, think about the act of choosing to keep her son on the boat, while Arianne took her child off the boat. This is as clear a message as a mother can send that she wanted freedom for her child. She wanted freedom despite the risks involved, despite a failed attempt to flee hours earlier, and despite the fact that the father remained in Cuba. \\n   Think about that moment of choice for Elizabeth--put my son on the beach and he can live with his father, or keep him with me so we could have the hope of freedom. It is clear to me that she valued freedom above everything. Now think--if that was you, and you died, would you want the child returned to Cuba? \\n   Think of yourself in Nazi Germany. A mother successfully smuggles a child out, but dies in the process at the hands of the Nazis. The father, probably under duress, demands the return of his child. Would we contemplate returning him? Would we return a child under the same circumstances to Saddam Hussein's Iraq? If a mother and child were scaling the Berlin wall and the mother was shot, but the child was pushed over--would we send the child back? Absolutely not. \\n   On the night of November 21, this group of Cuban nationals repaired their boat and set sail a second time. On the following night, the boat capsized. The survivors clung to anything that would float and hung on for dear life. After a day struggling for her life, Elizabeth died. But before she passed on, she told a fellow passenger who did survive, Nivaldo Fernandez, to make sure that Elian touches land, to make sure he touches dry land. \\n   As many of my colleagues know well, if a Cuban refugee reaches American soil they will not be sent back to Cuba. Every Cuban knows that reaching ``dry land'' means they will be free from Castro's iron fist. Elizabeth's dying wish was for her Elian to reach dry land. There can be no doubt about what she wanted for her son. \\n   Mr. President, I come to the floor today with great disappointment--disappointment in this Administration and disappointment in the Attorney General. Elian Gonzalez's mother's death will be in vain and this little boy's struggle for freedom, his struggle to live in America, simply is being dismissed if the boy's best interests and the family's legal rights are not considered. \\n   Many will say that this is a simple decision, the INS and the Department of Justice should merely reunite a father with the son he loves. I think all of us recognize the intense and profound bond between parent and child. It is to be respected and cherished. It is a natural instinct to want to reunite parent and child. But these are by no means ordinary circumstances. I ask the American people to look beyond the headlines, to understand the intense pressure this father is under. It is unlike anything you or I will ever experience in a free America. I have no doubt the father loves his little boy. But how many of us have stopped and thought about why this father did not come to his son the day he was found, exhausted and dehydrated having survived a treacherous trip at sea. Consider why he has not come for almost 5 months to support his son, hug his son, comfort his son. Again, I would suspect it is not out of lack of concern for his boy. I would suspect it is because Castro would not let him. \\n   Is it possible the father wants the boy to remain with his family in Miami and live in freedom? My understanding is that the father knew Elian and his mother were coming to this country and even told other family members that he would get to America if he ``had to do so in a bowl.'' \\n   I can't imagine anyone disagrees with the notion that Castro controls the father's words and actions through duress--through intimidation. The fact is that none of us knows the true wishes of this father. Castro has used this father and son to manipulate both Cuba and the United States. \\n   Today, the United States is not about to reunite a boy and his father, instead we are about to reunite a child and his dictator. And we are doing so against his mother's wishes. We may be doing so against his father's wishes, as well. \\n   Last week, a spokesman of the Cuban embassy stated ``Elian Gonzalez is a possession of the Cuban Government.'' In Castro's Cuba, the state always has the last word in how a child is raised--it does not matter if a parent disagrees. According to Cuban law, any parent who questions the regime or takes any action deemed to run contrary to the revolution's goals could be imprisoned or executed. \\n   Let me quote a former Cuban Government official from a recent Washington Post op-ed.  \\n   Within Cuba, the return of Elian will not be seen as an act of justice by the U.S. government, but rather as yet another victory for the bully-boy tactics of Fidel Castro. This is why the dictator is trying to recover Elian--to convert him into a different kind of symbol--a symbol of the Revolution--even though for that to happen, Elian would have to renounce his mother, the family in Miami that took care of him and even in fact, his father, Juan Miguel. Because upon returning to Cuba, he will not belong to his family. He will be another son of the Revolution.  \\n   If Cuba were a free country, this situation would have been easily resolved. But Cuba is not free, it is a police state. In fact, Article 8 of Cuba's Code for Children and Youth states: ``Society and the State work for the efficient protection of youths against all influences contrary to their communist formation.'' \\n   Make no mistake, in Cuba, Elian will not have a normal childhood. \\n   In Cuba, Elian will be allowed to live with his father until he is eleven; thereafter he will be sent to work in a farm-labor camp for 45 to 60 days per year. \\n   In Cuba, Elian will face compulsory military service until he is 27. \\n   In Cuba, Elian will be indoctrinated in the glories of ``the revolution'' and taught to regard any Cubans who reject Castroism--including his dead mother--as counterrevolutionaries and traitors. \\n   In Cuba, Elian will be allowed to attend college only if his ``political attitude and social conduct'' satisfy the regime in Havana. \\n   Returning Elian to Cuba means returning him to Fidel Castro. When I was a child, my parents had the last word in my upbringing. In Cuba, Castro's wishes carry the day--he can override any parent. Be assured Castro will begin his manipulation of Elian from the day of his return. I can see the images now--parades and banners, welcoming home the young defender of the ``Communist Revolution.'' Elian may remain closer to Fidel than any other child may be forced to suffer. The boy may get better treatment as a result, but this will be only on the surface. This innocent child will be captive--a prisoner in his own homeland. The regime cannot afford for this boy to return to Cuba only to renounce Castro's ways. Elian will be treated, not as a child, but as an opportunity to exploit. His home, his education, his father's salary, everything, will be provided as Fidel dictates. The pathetic efforts of a desperate tyrant to legitimize his method of oppression will make Elian a test. My colleagues, he is a child. Instead of Fidel's cruelties, he needs compassion. \\n   There is a reason Elian's mother and countless others have risked everything and have given their lives in the hope that their children will taste freedom. And while Elian's mother's voice  cannot be heard now, her actions were loud and clear. \\n   I would not be so angry if we were truly reuniting a parent and child. But if we return Elian, the United States will be caving to the demands of the last tyrant in the Western Hemisphere and will be sending a six-year-old boy to a place that Human Rights Watch states has a ``highly developed machinery of repression.'' And the United States will be doing this without providing basic civil rights to Elian--without permitting his legal options to play out. \\n   Instead, our Government is short circuiting justice for political expediency and we will have to live with that. The outrage and fury I feel toward the administration, the Department of Justice and the INS for the manner in which they have handled the Elian Gonzalez case is overwhelming. \\n   The United States is a Nation committed to the principles of freedom, justice, democracy and respect for human dignity. We are a nation built upon a rich diversity of heritage. We celebrate the uniqueness of our roots, family traditions and cultural experiences. And while this rich diversity is the strength of our great country, we, as Americans, share a common bond that is even stronger. That common bond is our precious freedom. Freedom to pursue our dreams, freedom to raise our children, freedom to speak our minds, and freedom from a government that dictates what we say, where we should live, and what we will become. \\n   These principles strengthen our democracy, our nation. These principles are what continue to draw people to America's shores. Our democracy is designed to preserve and protect the rights of the weak and the strong. Our judicial system is designed to promote access to justice for all Americans. But what we have seen in the past several weeks from our own Justice Department in its' handling of the Elian Gonzalez case shakes the very foundation of our American principles. \\n   Instead of defending these principles, this Administration has intimidated Elian's American family with the sheer weight, power, and force of the United States Government. This Administration has chosen to grind down this family's emotions and trample on the family's rights. In the process, the best interests of this boy have been undeniably neglected and his mother's wishes ignored. This Administration's treatment of a young child has evolved into an exercise of cruel and unusual punishment to preserve a pre-determined outcome and to placate an old and bitter dictator. \\n   The United States is a free country. We have a Bill or Rights, a code of laws, and a separation of powers which guarantees no administration shall be able to sidestep the law. We are a country in which the judicial system should be permitted to work without presidential influence for political expediency--and certainly without bringing the mighty weight and power of the government down on the weakest of all people--a child. \\n   But, in the last four months, this administration, our United States Government, has overstepped its bounds. Mr. President, I am disillusioned by the present status of this struggle for freedom. Disillusioned that these calls to honor freedom have fallen on deaf ears. But, then I think of the Cuban parents who so loved their children that they sent them unaccompanied to the United States in the 1960's in what became known as ``Operation Pedro Pan.'' Fourteen thousand and eighty-four children were sent away from the clutches of Castro by their loving parents to go to America to live in freedom. These parents willingly sent their children in order to escape Castro--in order to escape oppression. Many, if not most, of these children had no family in the United States. But they were sent to the United States with their parents wish for freedom--freedom at all costs. \\n   We know Elian's mother sought freedom for her son--and she paid the ultimate price. We know many in Elian's family had already come to the United States; some recently, some long ago. But we have taken the sad, sad action of assuming a man whose very life and that of his family, depends upon the goodwill of a tyrant, has the ability to speak freely. What a tragedy that this man cannot speak openly and freely about his true desire. What a sad day in the history of the United States of America. \\n   Our founding principle--our Declaration of Independence--declares, ``we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.'' We, the inheritors of this legacy, must not force people into tyranny. \\n   I appeal to the President and the Attorney General to resolve this in such a manner that Elian's struggle and his mother's tragic death will not have been in vain. Perhaps we, the United States of America, will realize that if we don't, we are making a tragic mistake in the handling of this case. It is not too late, though, to do the right thing for this little boy. I call on the President of the United States and the Attorney General once again, to consider what is in the little boy's best interest. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-20000413\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, there was an interest here, certainly. There are some who have discriminated against one group or another, who have not spoken out for one group and have spoken out for another. \\n   In my career representing the State of Florida and the Senate, I have spoken out for every group looking for honest and fair treatment, whether they be Cuban, whether they be Nicaraguan, or whether they be Haitian. I have done that. I am proud that I have done that. Some of those positions have not been particularly popular in my State. But I have always taken that position. \\n   Again, I think the right thing to do is to ask a very simple question: What is in the boy's best interest? \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000329\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I intend to speak on another issue. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business for not to exceed 5 minutes. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000329\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I come to the floor of the Senate to speak about an incident that occurred just before Thanksgiving Day 1999, when a mother who so loved her son that she tried to bring him to the shores of the United States of America from Cuba. Had she succeeded, she would have joined her family members already in the United States. Instead, she met with tragedy in the Florida straits. The mother died. The five-year-old boy survived. Now, we are being forced to consider young Elian's future. \\n   Today, the freedom sought by a mother for her son is being mocked. Elian Gonzalez finds himself in the middle of a struggle between his Miami family and the Department of Justice, an agency unwilling to consider what is in the best interest of the child, an agency continually impairing a fair presentation of the merits of this case. \\n   I ask my colleagues to open their minds and their hearts and listen to why the current process being used by the DOJ and the INS represents a grave injustice and denies a decision that should be based upon Elian's best interest. Remember when Elian first arrived, the INS stated that the matter was a custody decision for a Florida state family court. Forty-eight hours after Castro threatened the United States, the decision flipped, and continues to bend to Castro's will. Now the administration wants to rush an appeals process to send him back to a country that Human Rights Watch states has ``highly developed machinery of repression.'' \\n   In the past week, the Department of Justice has put unrealistic demands on the family of Elian to expedite the appeal of the federal district court decision. The Department of Justice has repeatedly threatened to revoke Elian's parole and remove the child to Cuba if the family fails to agree to their demand that both sides have an appellate brief prepared in one week. These unprecedented tactics short-circuit and dismantle the judicial process in which an appellate is typically allotted a minimum of 30-60 days to prepare a brief. This is plain and simple--Elian's family's civil rights are being denied. \\n   This past Monday, the family under great pressure filed a motion with the Eleventh Circuit to expedite the appeals process, and still, the government's threats have continued. In a letter sent to the family at 10 p.m. on Monday night, the government demanded that the family's attorneys appear for a meeting on Tuesday morning at 9 a.m. with INS officials to discuss the revocation of Elian's parole. The government has continually dictated the terms of all meetings and has bulldozed over the right of Elian and his Miami family. \\n   Today, the Department of Justice has summoned Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, to a meeting where he is expected by the INS to sign a unilateral demand ``to comply with the instructions of the INS,'' yet the INS has failed to provide the attorneys and the family with what those instructions will be. After all this child has been through, is it too much to ask how the government plans on removing him from the only home he now knows? Should his family agree to having INS agents come to his Miami home and take him? Probably not. But one thing is for sure: they should know the details of what they are agreeing to. \\n   Keep in mind that this same agreement, if signed, destroys any shred of dignity left in our judicial process. It demands that the family's attorneys have a brief prepared to submit to the Supreme Court within 5 days of the appellate court decision, a time line virtually impossible to meet. \\n   In its effort to dictate terms for the family's appeal, the government has betrayed the very integrity for which the Attorney General is charged with defending--equal protection under the law and the right to pursue justice in a free America. In the past week, I've heard justice department officials say they are taking more aggressive action against the family because they want  to prevent them from invoking more ``legal maneuvers.'' These ``legal maneuvers'' happen to be the legal rights of Americans--properly exercised in the middle of an appeals process. These ``legal maneuvers'' are tools in which all Americans are empowered to seek a fair hearing in the United States of America. I find it unconscionable that the justice department would so blatantly express their desire to dictate terms and influence the outcome of this case. \\n   My reason for coming to the floor today is express my sheer frustration and anger in the manner in which the DOJ and the INS has handled this case. The recent acts of these two agencies demonstrate that the administration is no longer interested in resolving this case in a fair, unbiased way. The offer by the Department of Justice is a deeply flawed offer, one that no American would ever accept, one that no person in America should ever have to accept. Elian's mother sacrificed her life for the freedoms of America, freedoms she never had in Cuba, freedoms she never thought our country would deny her son in his moment of need. We should all, despite our views on this issue, be deeply ashamed at any attempt to short circuit justice in order to reach a resolution in the quickest possible way. \\n   In the United States, we stand up to injustice in the world by zealously guarding our laws. We consistently and rightly argue that our strength and power come from our commitment to America's principles: freedom, justice, democracy and the protection of basic human rights. We are a nation founded upon these principles and we remain strong because we defend them. Mr. President, today and throughout the course of Elian's stay in the United States the INS and our Attorney General have not stood up for the one thing they are supposed to defend--justice for all. \\n   Mr. President, I yield the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000322\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I want to express my strong support for repealing the Social Security Earnings Test for working seniors. Many of my colleagues and I have been working together for the past 12 years to pass this legislation. At long last, the Senate is going to retire the Social Security Earnings Test. \\n   The Social Security Earnings Test is a 70 year old dinosaur of a law which was initiated to insure that Social Security benefits were granted specifically to retired persons. Today, unfortunately, economic reality dictates the need for many senior citizens to continue working in order to achieve a basic standard of living. The Social Security Earnings Test stands as a roadblock to independence for tens of thousands of seniors throughout the United States. Furthermore, America's seniors represent a wealth of talent and skill. A national policy which discourages them from working is simply counterproductive. \\n   Clearly, few other states have been as impacted by the unfair Social Security Earnings Test as the people in my home state of Florida. I've seen first-hand the impact upon Seniors of laws which limit income. We have already seen the impact caused by President Clinton's 1993 tax hike on Seniors, when he raised the Social Security benefit tax from 50% up to 85%. When are we, as a nation, going to stop penalizing success? \\n   It's not a group of greedy millionaires who are being impacted by the earnings test restrictions. It's lower and moderate income Seniors who need some relief from their government to simply survive. In Florida, we are talking about grandparents who live on Social Security plus any outside work they can get. And if you have grandma in the hospital or a nursing home fighting Alzheimer's Disease, and grandpa has go find some work to pay the bills, the Social Security Earnings Test is simply another hurdle they have to overcome. \\n   Several years ago, I was visiting a worksite in Safety Harbor, Florida where I met with a group of working Seniors. I asked them why they were working past the traditional retirement age. Some said they simply wanted to have a reason to get out of the house and do something productive. Others said they needed the additional income to take care of a loved one. Still others said they wanted to maintain a certain lifestyle without Federal interference. \\n   But I was most struck by one gentleman who said to me, ``Senator, we live in a throw away society. Don't let them throw us away.'' What this gentleman was saying was that the message the Earnings Test sends is that society no longer needs you. How can we, as a society, say such a thing? Clearly, we shouldn't. \\n   Finally, consider this thought. Baseball fans might remember my grandfather, Connie Mack, who spent many years in major league baseball. In 1929, he managed the World Champion Philadelphia Athletics. In 1929, he was 66 years old. Suppose he had succumbed to the idea that, at that age, there was no purpose for pursuing one's ideas, one's dreams in life. Suppose he had been told by our nation that he was no longer of value to society. He might not have had the opportunity to produce that great team. Fortunately, we didn't have a law which could have forced him into retirement. \\n   The Federal government is sending a message to working Seniors that they are over the hill. The only thing that is over the hill is the Earnings Test. We need to retire the Earnings Test, not our Seniors. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000322\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks regarding the Risk Management for the 21st Century Act. \\n   Floridians know all too well the impact of natural disasters on the agriculture community. While I am proud of the ability of our growers to rebuild their farms after such devastating losses, enormous disaster aid bills only serve as a band-aid fix to the problem. We must work harder to ensure that all farmers have access to the necessary risk-management tools. This bill encourages growers to purchase appropriate levels of crop insurance, hopefully avoiding the band-aid fix in future appropriation measures. \\n   Florida is the ninth leading agricultural state in the nation, with annual farm receipts totaling $6 billion. The industry employs over 80,000 people and generates more than $18 billion in related economic activity. In 1998, hard working Floridians produced more than 25 billion pounds of food, and more than 2 million tons of livestock feed. I am proud to say that Florida leads the nation in production of 18 major agricultural commodities including oranges, sugarcane and fresh tomatoes. With these statistics in mind, it is imperative to ensure that federal programs work with, not against, Florida's farmers. \\n   As an original co-sponsor of S. 1401, the Specialty Crop Insurance Act of 1999, I support the effort to reduce the dependence of the specialty crop industry on catastrophic loss insurance coverage by improving its access to quality crop insurance policies. By failing to account for the unique characteristics associated with farming specialty crops, current crop insurance policies do not include many specialty crop producers. \\n   Through promotion of affordable crop insurance policies, S. 1401 would increase specialty crop producer participation in the Federal Crop Insurance Program. Today's legislation, S. 2251, the Risk Management for the 21st Century Act, includes many of these specialty crop provisions. \\n   This legislation requires that 50% of the funds dedicated to research and development for the new crop insurance products are focused on specialty crop product development. At a level of $20 million per year, the legislation authorizes the Risk Management Agency to enter into partnerships with private and public entities to increase the availability of risk management tools for specialty crops. The expertise of outside agencies will most certainly help the Risk Management Agency develop sound specialty crop insurance policies. \\n   The Risk Management for the 21st Century Act also includes an expansion of Risk Management Agency pilot authority, removal of the Non-insured Assistance Program (NAP) area trigger, incentives for growers who purchase ``buy-up'' coverage, and it proposes a premium refund for low-risk producers. These reforms will ease our nation's growers dependence on short sighted disaster relief bills. \\n   This bill is the product of countless hours of negotiation, and I believe it represents an incredible opportunity to improve our Federal Crop Insurance Program. The Agriculture Committee has been extremely helpful in including the interests of specialty crop producers, and I thank them for their time and effort. I urge my colleagues to support the Risk Management for the 21st Century Act. \\n   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000309\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, S. Res. 60, makes March 10, 2000 the Tibetan Day of Commemoration. This marks the forty-first anniversary of the 1959 Lhasa uprising over the course of which over 87,000 Tibetans were killed, arrested, or deported to labor camps by the People's Liberation Army. So tomorrow, we honor the memory of the  more than 87,000 Tibetans who struggled for the preservation of Tibet. We also honor the 6 million Tibetans today who keep alive the hope of freedom in Tibet and the tens of thousands of exiles who hope to return home. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000302\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise in support of amendment 2827. This amendment, cosponsored by Senators HATCH and MURKOWSKI, is very simple and straightforward. It eliminates the marriage penalty in the education savings accounts. \\n   Married couples should not suffer a tax increase just because they are married. The so-called marriage penalties in the Tax Code do just that. Married couples often have to pay higher taxes than the couple would owe if they were single filers. The House has recently addressed this issue in the broader Tax Code, and we will soon do the same. But it makes no sense to have marriage penalties built into newer programs we have created, such as the tax-free education savings accounts. \\n   Under this amendment, as under the administration's HOPE scholarship tax credit and Lifetime Learning credit, the income eligibility for joint filers would be double the amount for single filers. People who qualify for these accounts when they are single should not lose this valuable opportunity to provide for their children's education just because they got married. \\n   When the Senate first passed education savings accounts in the 1997 Taxpayer Relief Act, all Americans  were eligible to use these vehicles to save for their children's education. While that bill was in conference, however, income limits were added to this tax benefit, but these limits injected a marriage penalty into this provision. There is absolutely no policy justification for a marriage penalty in education tax benefits. This should not be a partisan issue. \\n   As I mentioned earlier, the administration's education proposal did not contain a marriage penalty, but the income limits the administration negotiated when the 1997 bill was in conference created a marriage penalty in the education savings accounts. Now is the time for us to eliminate this marriage penalty. \\n   According to my Joint Economic Committee staff, this amendment will allow over 2 million households to establish education savings accounts for their children. \\n   We should be looking to remove marriage penalties in the Tax Code instead of making them worse. Our amendment will ensure that married couples can save for their children's education on an equal basis, as single individuals can. \\n   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and yield the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-20000302\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I wanted to put some information in the RECORD. It is unfortunate that all Members did not have the information as to what the cost of this amendment would be. It is nowhere near what was implied by my friend who just concluded his comments. \\n   The Joint Tax Committee has estimated the amendment will reduce taxes by only $7 million over 10 years. That is point one. Point two, the reason that is the case is because the individuals who would be affected by this already have the option to use prepaid tuition plans. \\n   Now, there seems to be agreement with respect to tuition tax plans of people of high income, as Senator REID indicated a moment ago. We have all agreed it was fair to them. Why is it not fair to allow the same benefits to derive to them under the education savings accounts as under the prepaid tuition plan? \\n   So, again, the cost is $7 million over 10 years. Roughly 2 million families would be affected, not 20 percent of potential families. It is narrowly focused and it is addressing the issue of a marriage penalty; there is no place in our proposal, the education savings plan, for discriminating against those who are married. \\n   I thank the Chair for the time. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000302\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and my friend and colleague Senator GRAHAM to introduce a resolution contragulating Florida State University's football team on winning the 1999 Division 1-A Collegiate Football National Championship. As a Senator from Florida and the father-in-law of an avid Seminole, I join with all those in my home state and those across this country in honoring Coach Bobby Bowden, his staff, and the football team for this outstanding accomplishment. Not only is this a special achievement that will long be remembered by the coaches and the players but it is also a moment to savor for the students, alumni and supporters of Florida State University. \\n   Florida State University has one of the most exciting, prolific and successful college football teams in the country. In fact, they won 108 football games between 1990 and 1999, more than any other Division 1-A college football team during this timeframe. By finishing the 1999 season undefeated and untied, they have also extended their NCAA Division 1-A record streak of top-four finishes in the final Associated Press poll to 13 years in a row, the only football team to have accomplished this feat. \\n   But as impressive as all these achievements are, they have accomplished what no other football team has been able to do. The 1999 Seminoles are the first Division I-A collegiate football team in the country to be ranked number one for the entire season by the Associated Press since the preseason rankings began in 1950. \\n   1999 will also be remembered fondly by my good friend Bobby Bowden for reasons other than surpassing the 300 victory mark, or winning his second football national championship, or for obtaining his first perfect season in 40 years as a head football coach. In 1999, Coach Bowden and his lovely wife, Ann, celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary. Coach Bowden, Priscilla and I wish you and your wife our sincere congratulations on this most important milestone. \\n   The State of Florida is indeed fortunate to be the home to three of the finest college football teams in the nation: Florida State University, the University of Florida and the University of Miami. Together, these three schools have won seven Division 1-A college football championships since 1984. That's seven college football championships in the last 16 years. This proves that the road to the college football national championship goes right through the State of Florida. \\n   For those who love to wear the Garnet and Gold and do the Seminole Chop and the FSU War Chant, I am honored to introduce this resolution on their behalf, which honors the 1999 Florida State football team, the coaches and staff for winning the Division 1-A Collegiate Football national championship. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000224\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I object. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000224\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to commemorate four brave Americans. Theirs is a story of courage, it is a story of heroism, and it is a story of freedom. \\n   Four years ago today, on February 24, 1996, Fidel Castro sent Cuban MiG fighters into the Florida Straits and killed Carlos Costa, Armando Alejandre, Mario de la Pen 6a, and Pablo Morales. \\n   These men were members of a humanitarian organization known as ``Brothers to the Rescue.'' These volunteers search the Florida Straits for rafters. Too many Cubans die each year in their flight to freedom. The Brothers try to save lives. \\n   So my thoughts and prayers today are with the families of the brave and courageous humanitarians who lost their lives 4 years ago. I know this day must be especially difficult for the families--today reminds them of the terrible loss suffered, and today also  marks another year passed without closure. \\n   People need to be able to put the past behind them and move on. But when the President and his administration give assurances and advice, and American families trust and obey this advice only to be dragged along and let down, the administration commits a great injustice. \\n   Think for a moment about Armando's sister or Mario's mother, or any other family member. Think for a moment, how you would feel if your brother or son was murdered while volunteering with a humanitarian organzation--killed by state-of-the-art fighter jets flown by the air force of one of the world's last totalitarian dictators? I know the pain for me would be unbearable. \\n   I join with the families today in remembering these brave men. I want to tell their story of freedom, their story of courage, and their story of heroism. \\n   Armando came to the United States from Cuba as a child. He so loved his life here, his freedom, that he joined the U.S. Marine Corps and volunteered for a tour in Vietnam. He volunteered to fight for his adopted home. He survived his tour only to be murdered by Fidel Castro. He was 45 years old. His wife of 21 years and his daughter have now lived with the struggle for justice for 4 years. They are in our thoughts today. \\n   Carlos, a Florida native, was 29 years old when the Cuban government shot him out of the sky. He was always interested in aviation and dreamed of one day overseeing the operations of a major airport. He received his college degree from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University and worked for the Dade County Aviation Department. His parents and sister today are in our thoughts. \\n   Mario, a New Jersey native, was only 24 years old when Castro's MiG's took his life. He was in his last semester at Embry-Riddle, working toward his dream of becoming an airline pilot. His parents and brother are in our thoughts today. \\n   Pablo left Cuba on a raft in 1992, and the Brothers to the Rescue saved his life. Indebted to these heroic pilots, he joined them and began training to obtain his pilot's license. Pablo often talked of his family still in Cuba and how much he missed them. Since his death, there are reports that they have been persecuted and discriminated against. Our thoughts are with his family in Cuba today. \\n   Remember, as you think of these men this afternoon, what they were doing when they lost their lives--they were working to save the lives of others. This humanitarian effort must have so enraged Fidel Castro that he ordered the interception of these small, unarmed aircraft by his huge fighter jets to be blown from the sky with air-to-air missiles. \\n   Two days after their murder four days ago, the President so moved by this tragedy said on national television;  \\n   I am asking that Congress pass legislation that will provide immediate compensation to the families, something to which they are entitled under international law, out of Cuba's blocked assets here in the United States.  \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-20000224\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Two months later the Congress passed the bill--the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1996--and the President signed it in a large ceremony on the White House lawn. \\n   The Brothers' families wanted to understand the new rules before they chose to proceed with any civil suit. They met with officials from the U.S. State Department to clarify the meaning of the new law. \\n   In their meeting at the State Department, the families were told the U.S. Government encouraged them to file the civil lawsuit against the Cuban government. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-3-20000224\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, they took the Cuban Government to court. It took a long time, but eventually they won. In December of 1997, almost 2 years ago, a United States Federal court entered judgments against Cuba for the murders of their family members. Justice seemed to be won. The end appeared to be near. But the very same U.S. Government and the same Clinton administration that encouraged the families to postpone closure and pursue legal justice began to oppose them. They entered the lawsuit on the side of Fidel Castro. \\n   I quote from Maggie Khule's testimony of last October before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Maggie Khule is the sister of Armando Alejandre:  \\n   No words can possibly explain our shock when we went to court and found U.S. attorneys sitting down at the same table as Cuba's attorneys. How can you explain to a mother who has lost her son, to a wife who has lost her husband, to a daughter who has lost her father, that their own government is taking the murderer's side?...... The Clinton administration has shut its doors to us. Secretary of State Albright, for example, won't meet with us on any of our other concerns because, to quote an aide, ``We are on the opposing side of this civil action.'' Are we? We thought we were the victims' families, victims ourselves. We thought we were Americans entitled to protection from our own country. We thought Cuba was the terrorist, the guilty party.  \\n   Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to take a moment from their busy schedules today, on this fourth anniversary of the murder of four brave humanitarians, and think about the blight of terrorism and the cost it has extracted from too many families of our country. \\n   Think also this afternoon about what we ask to deter terrorism and promote justice. I want to read one more quote, this time from a Federal judge who heard the case brought by the families against Cuba. After observing this administration's change of position from support to opposition, he states the following in the March 1999 ruling:  \\n   The court notes with great concern that the very President who in 1996 decried this terrorist action by the Government of Cuba now sends the Department of Justice to argue before this court that Cuba's blocked assets ought not to be used to compensate the families of the U.S. nationals murdered by Cuba. The executive branch's approach to this situation has been inconsistent at best. It apparently believes that shielding a terrorist state's assets are more important than compensating for the loss of American lives.  \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-4-20000224\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, the story of these four brothers, the Brothers to the Rescue, is a story of heroism and freedom. These men risked their lives for their own freedom as well as for the freedom of others, and their families have fought tirelessly for justice. I hope my colleagues will think about these courageous families. We must, indeed, honor them and their memories and the memories of their loved ones this afternoon. \\n   Mr. President, I yield the floor. \\n   Transcript From ABC News, February 26, 1996 \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000207\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I understand that S. 2036, introduced earlier today by Senator SMITH of New Hampshire, is at the desk and I, therefore, ask for its first reading. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-20000207\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I now ask for its second reading and object to my own request. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000207\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today it adjourn until the hour of 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday, February 8. I further ask consent that on Tuesday, immediately following the prayer, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the morning hour be deemed expired, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and the Senate then begin a period of morning business until 10:30 a.m., with Senators speaking for up to 5 minutes each, with the following exceptions: The first 30 minutes under the control of Senator DURBIN or his designee; the second 30 minutes under the control of Senator THOMAS or his designee. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-20000207\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Further, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate stand in recess from the hours of 12:30 p.m. to 2:15 p.m. for the weekly policy conferences to meet. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000207\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. For the information of all Senators, the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 10:30 a.m. Following morning business, it is expected that the Senate will then begin consideration of the nuclear waste disposal bill. If that consent is not granted, then there is an understanding that a cloture vote will occur at 2:15 on Tuesday with respect to a committee amendment. Members should be aware that amendments to the nuclear waste bill are anticipated, and those concerned are close to reaching an agreement providing for a limited number of amendments and debate time. Therefore, Senators can expect votes throughout tomorrow's session of the Senate. It is hoped that Senators who have amendments will work with the bill managers in an effort to complete this legislation in a timely manner. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000207\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. If there is no further business to come before the Senate, I now ask unanimous consent that the Senate stand in adjournment under the previous order. \\n   There being no objection, the Senate, at 5:10 p.m., adjourned until Tuesday, February 8, 2000, at 9:30 a.m. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000124\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000124\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I send a bill to the desk and ask for its first reading. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-20000124\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I now ask for its second reading. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-3-20000124\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I then ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000124\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill granting Elian Gonzalez American citizenship. \\n   What it means is that the most important decision in this young boy's life will not be made by a political bureaucracy--but by a family court. \\n   Mr. President, neither the President of the United States, his Attorney General, nor the dictator ruling Cuba is qualified to decide the fate of this little boy. The United States is a country of laws, and we zealously believe in the rule of law. Elian deserves access to the legal protections of our family courts. These courts are in the business of considering family cases day after day. And they would consider ``what is in the boy's best interest.'' Today, the only concern of the INS is ``who speaks for the boy,'' not about his future. \\n   The primary purpose of this legislation is to ensure Elian has access to America's family courts: a court that will consider the choice that his mother made when she gave her life for freedom. \\n   Mr. President, we will continue this debate sometime later in the week and make no mistake, I believe that Elian should remain here in the United States where he can live in freedom. But it is not my purpose to make that decision; that is the function of a family court. \\n   This bill is intended to allow a family court to settle this dispute based upon the best interests of Elian Gonzalez. \\n   I yield the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19991118\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-19991118\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19991110\\n\\n    Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to address a problem that ought to be a concern to all of us: natural disasters and the exposure of the private insurance industry to catastrophic risks. In my state of Florida, we have a particular concern about hurricane risk, but many areas of the country are exposed to the risks of other major catastrophes--whether they be volcanoes, earthquakes or tornadoes. Increasingly, I am concerned about the state of the private insurance industry and its ability to withstand a major catastrophe--a catastrophe of Hurricane Andrew size ($15 billion in insured losses) or greater. \\n   Today, I am introducing legislation to help address this problem and strengthen disaster protection for homeowners and businesses while protecting the interests of the taxpayer. I am pleased my friend from Texas, Senator HUTCHISON, has joined me in this effort. I believe our approach is an innovative, private-sector solution to the problem of catastrophic risk and I encourage my colleagues to review this proposal carefully. \\n   Consumers of property and casualty insurance must be able to rely on their insurers for protection against the risk of catastrophic loss. However, protection for policyholders in today's system is weak; a major future catastrophe could leave consumers without protection and--if past experience is any indication--the government would intervene to ensure the people in the disaster areas receive timely compensation. It is important to note that current law actually poses a disincentive for insurers to set aside special reserves for catastrophic events. Any money set aside to cover potential risk is considered taxable income. To fix this flaw in America's insurance system, we need to provide incentives for insurers to set aside a portion of their policy premiums in secure reserve funds that will be available to meet policyholder needs in the event of future catastrophes. Our bill does just that. \\n   The typical property and casualty insurance company in the United States is exposed to multiple forms of catastrophic risk. This risk can take the form of major disasters that occur only once in a decade or once in several decades (e.g., severe earthquakes, major hurricanes). These can also be in the form of localized natural disasters (e.g., tornadoes, wildfires, floods, winter storms) that cause unusually large policyholder losses in a region and imperil the ability of smaller insurance companies to help their policyholders in the area. \\n   The nation's exposure to these large natural disasters is staggering. While millions of families and small businesses rely on insurance payments to recover from natural disasters, it is important to remember that--under our current insurance tax and regulatory systems--many private insurers may not be able to pay all claims arising from a major disaster. Hurricane Andrew and the Northridge Earthquake opened our eyes to the country's massive exposure to catastrophic losses. Insured losses in my state from Hurricane Andrew exceeded $15 billion. But if this storm had passed over Miami, rather than Homestead just 40 miles south, insured losses could have reached $50 billion, leaving the Florida economy crippled and more than a third of all insurers in that market insolvent. \\n   There is always the potential for a major disaster in any given year in the United States. Estimates of insured losses from highly probable events range from about $75 billion in California and Florida to $100 billion or more in areas of the Midwest. The Gulf, Intermountain West, and Atlantic states all face exposures of approximately $20 billion or more. \\n   Unfortunately, our current system of tax laws and accounting rules work against consumers and taxpayers because they discourage private market preparation for future major disasters. Present tax laws do not permit portions of consumers' insurance policy payments to be set aside and tax deferred in order to provide for the risk of truly catastrophic loss events. Ironically, our tax system allows insurers to set aside funds on a tax-deductible basis to address disasters that have already happened but it gives them no incentive to prepare for those major disasters that have not yet happened. \\n   Policyholder premiums needed to fund policyholders' catastrophic losses in future years are subject to current tax if not used in a particular year. This diminishes the power of insurers to protect policyholders against future losses. This structure is inadequate for assuring that property-casualty policies will protect consumers from future major catastrophic losses. \\n   The tax law should be revised in order to make accommodation for disaster protection reserves and bring about a more practical, and sensible, system for insurance companies and consumers. \\n   Under the Policyholder Disaster Protection Act, insurers could set aside portions of policyholder payments in a tax-deferred disaster protection fund. Amounts from this fund used to pay for losses from a major disaster would be subject to taxation. This concept is similar to programs presently in place in many other developed countries. \\n   I believe this legislation would result in greater stability for insurers providing catastrophic coverage and fewer insolvencies after a major disaster. A recent study by a major U.S. accounting firm determined that approximately $21 billion in pre-funded reserves would be accumulated within the first ten years of the program.  Also, the tax incentive in the bill will encourage insurers to serve disaster-prone areas in a responsible manner by setting aside funds to pay for major losses. \\n   The treatment of the fund by insurers would be closely regulated. Following is a general description of the provisions of the bill: \\n   Insurers would be able to set aside special tax-deferred reserves to cover potential catastrophic events. \\n   The maximum amount any insurer could set aside in a given year would be determined by reference to each insurance company's exposure to the risk of catastrophic loss events. \\n   Deductible contributions to disaster protection funds would be voluntary, but would be irrevocable once made (except to the extent of ``drawdowns'' for actual catastrophic loss events, or drawdowns otherwise required by state insurance regulators). No company could use these funds to shelter income from taxation. \\n   The maximum allowable reserve for any given company will increase or decrease as they enter or exit lines of business that pose catastrophic risk. \\n   Insurers would only be allowed to drawdown the disaster reserves if the loss event in question is declared an emergency or disaster by certain recognized bodies or government officials (for example, a disaster declared by the President under the Stafford Act) and that losses in a year exceed the specified high level. The amounts distributed from the fund are added to company's taxable income for the year in which the drawdown occurred. \\n   Insurance companies would pay taxes on income generated when funds in the disaster reserve are invested. This income would be distributed out of the fund to the insurance company and taxed to the company on a current basis. \\n   The maximum reserve (or ``cap'') would be phased in at the rate of five percent per year over 20 years. Industry estimates indicate private reserves of $40 billion would be built up over this time. \\n   Various concepts to address the problem of catastrophic losses have been proposed over the years. I look forward to working with all of my colleagues to craft a comprehensive solution to both the short-term and long-term problems presented by the risk of catastrophic disasters. In my view, the private-sector focus of this bill, which puts a strengthened private insurance market for consumers in the forefront of disaster protection, is an approach designed to ensure disaster relief is efficient and cost-effective for taxpayers. While the federal government may still need to provide last-resort safety net for disaster victims, it is important to do what we can to ensure private insurance is available, affordable and secure for those citizens in those areas of the country at risk to a catastrophic disaster. This bill will help to bring precisely that availability, affordability and security to insurance policyholders throughout the country, and I believe it is worthy of support and consideration. \\n   The bill we're introducing today mirrors a bill introduced by Congressman FOLEY and MATSUI in the House of Representatives. It is also supported by taxpayer, homeowner, consumer, business and emergency service organizations, as well as local and state policy makers and insurance organizations. I believe it is a sensible approach and I hope my colleagues will join me in this effort. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19991104\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with my good friend Senator GRAMM, chairman of the Committee on Banking, on section 507 of the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999. I want to confirm that section 507 is intended to apply only to the amendments made by subtitle A of title V of the bill, and that section 507 is not to be construed, under any circumstances, to apply to any provision of law other than the provisions of subtitle A. For instance, subtitle A of title V relates only to disclosure of nonpublic personal information to nonaffiliated third parties. This means that section 507 of the bill does not supersede, alter, or affect laws on the disclosure of information among affiliated entities. In particular, section 507 does not supersede, alter, or affect the provisions of the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (or FCRA) regarding the communication of information among persons related by common ownership or affiliated by corporate control, nor does section 507 supersede, alter, or affect the existing FCRA preemption of state laws with respect to the exchange of information among affiliated entities. I yield to my friend. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-19991104\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the conference report accompanying S. 900, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999. And I want to begin my remarks today by congratulating Senator GRAMM, my friend and the chairman of the committee. We would not be here without his hard work, dedication, and skillful negotiation and he deserves the lion's share of credit for the fine bill we have before us today. \\n   We are making history here. It has been 66 years since Congress passed the Glass-Steagall banking act in the depths of the Great Depression. It has been at least twenty years since determined efforts began in the Congress to repeal this outdated law and modernize the country's banking code. Today--finally--we have come to the end of the road. \\n   As we stand on the verge of passing this bill, we have a great view both backward and forward. We can see a past in which the country's financial services industry led the world despite an archaic code recognized by everyone to be insufficient. And we can look ahead into a future that offers the American financial consumer: New and innovative products, better choices, information and service, and workable regulations that allow our financial firms to compete in the global marketplace to an even greater extent than today. \\n   This much-needed legislation modernizing our nation's banking laws is happening none too soon. I want to spend some time talking about the two reasons I believe we're here. The first is the transformation of our economy over the past 20 years, and by extension the remarkable changes in our financial services sector. And the second is the tremendous impact of the technological revolution on the banking industry. \\n   We are currently in the eighth year of the longest peacetime economic expansion in our history. When you look at the data, there is only one conclusion to draw: we are now reaping the economic benefits of the hard decisions on economic fundamentals we made back in the 1980s. Under the leadership of President Reagan, we dramatically lowered marginal tax rates, began the rollback of burdensome and overlapping regulations, promoted openness to trade and investment around the world, lowered interest rates, and defeated the inflation menace that crippled our economic competitiveness. In the 1990s, Congress finally completed the job by producing the first balanced federal budgets in a generation. \\n   You cannot overestimate the impact of these fundamental economic victories on the prosperity the nation is enjoying today. One of my biggest concerns, as I think about the history of this era, is people will be left with the impression that President Clinton's 1993 tax increases created this economic expansion. Nothing could be further from the truth. We must not forget the hard--and ultimately correct--decisions made on fundamental questions like taxes, regulation, interest rates, and inflation in the 1980s that freed up the marketplace and allowed American businesses to capitalize on their inherent advantages. \\n   The country's financial sector has certainly shared in this prosperity. We have witnessed a revolution in the delivery of financial services during the 1990s as the traditional barriers between banking, insurance and securities began to come down. Freedom and our free enterprise system ensured that new financial products and alliance emanated from America to service the demands of the global economy. These products and alliance provide American businesses, investors, and consumers with the ability to secure more easily the capital they need to finance their hopes and dreams. As this new economic and financial dynamic became more clear, it was also apparent our existing banking code was outdated and in need of change. \\n   As part of the new economy, it is hard to overstate the impact of the technological revolution on the financial marketplace. Earlier this year, during hearings on the bill before us, Chairman Greenspan noted the financial sector:  \\n   ..... is undergoing major and fundamental change driven by a revolution in technology, by dramatic innovations in the capital markets, and by the globalization of the financial markets and the financial services industry.  \\n   Indeed, the financial marketplace is changing with lightning speed. In September, we held a high-technology summit at the Joint Economic Committee. One of those who testified before our committee was a \\n   twenty-nine-year-old entrepreneur who created an electronic stock trading network. Nine of these electronic trading networks make up about twenty percent of the NASDAQ market and are posing a serious challenge to more traditional stock exchanges and markets. Mortgages and traditional banking services are available over the internet. And anybody who watches television advertisements knows a new generation od web-based businesses are transforming the traditional image--and, incidentally, the fee structure--of stock brokers and stock trading. These businesses and the many others who have gone online to challenge the existing orthodoxy are prompting sweeping changes in the financial marketplace. And they are creating yet another imperative for this bill. \\n   As the American financial industry seized on technological advances to lead the world into new financial markets and new financial products, they awoke from their long slumber of lobbying wars and turf protection and realized it was in everybody's best interest to pass this bill. If our financial firms are to lead and compete in the world marketplace, they must be able to compete from a position of strength. And they must compete from the foundation of banking laws that reflect the new realities of the world marketplace. \\n   The end game on this legislation was by no means easy. During the eleven months we spent writing this bill, we had to continually strike careful balances between the broad, over-arching goals of the bill and the temptation to tinker with the marketplace and predetermine the shape of future financial products and services. The fast pace of change presents a difficult choice for policymakers. We are often too cumbersome in the Congress to lead, we can be irrelevant if we follow, and some among us believe it could be risky to get out of the way. In the face of this dilemma, some of our colleagues wanted us to anticipate every possible side-effect of this financial transformation and write the laws accordingly. This is just not possible, and the resultant regulatory burdens would have stopped this financial revolution in its tracks.  \\n   In the bill before us today, we tried to embrace the following principles: \\n   First, banks, insurance companies and securities firms should be able to enter one another's business and create a financial dynamic for the next century; \\n   Second, new banking products should be regulated by the regulator that knows them best. \\n   Third, institutions should disclose to customers what they are doing with their sensitive personal information--both within and outside the financial firm. And customers should be able to stop these companies from sharing their information with third parties. \\n   Next, new financial activities conducted through subsidiaries of banks should be conducted so as to ensure taxpayer guaranteed deposits are not threatened. \\n   And finally, the burdensome regulations on banks with respect to community lending should not be increased as a result of what we're doing in this bill. \\n   There are sensible guidelines and I'm satisfied we've created the basis here for a safe, sound and flexible financial industry that will serve the interests of American consumers, investors and businesses well into the future. \\n   As I said at the beginning of my remarks, we are making history here. A hundred years from today, I believe the primary thing people will remember about this Congress is that we finally did the right thing and passed this bill. \\n   Mr. President, I would like to conclude my remarks on a personal note. As I begin to recognize the reality that my service in the United States Senate will end in slightly more than a year, I find I am engaging in the occasional reflection. \\n   During the last 12 years of my 18 years in the Congress, I served on the Senate Banking Committee--the committee responsible for writing and overseeing the laws of the land that regulate the banking and financial industry. This has been special to me because I spent the first sixteen years of my career in the banking business. It was work I enjoyed as the years went by. It was also work I found increasingly frustrating because of the stifling regulatory burden placed on banks by the federal government. It was for these and other reasons I left my position as President and LEO of my bank in Cape Coral, Florida and ran for the Congress. \\n   I will not stand here today and claim the credit for the far-reaching and far-sighted bill before us today. My friend and colleague Senator GRAMM deserves the credit on the Senate side. I nonetheless feel a strong sense of pride and institutional accomplishment for the legacy we are leaving to the United States in passing this bill. It will benefit the people, the industry, and the economy as a whole and it is truly a document we can all be very proud of. I urge my colleagues to support the conference report \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19991103\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to thank the chairman of the committee, Mr. ROTH, for including in the manager's package an amendment by Mr. SARBANES and myself expressing the sense of the Congress with respect to the issue of debt relief for poor countries. Our resolution simply expresses the desire of this body to work with the President and the international community to forgive the debt owed to us by the world's poorest countries in exchange for commitments from these countries to reform their economies and work toward a better quality of life for their people. This follows on legislation we introduced earlier this month to accomplish this important objective. \\n   Our effort today is premised on the notion that we must help these poverty-stricken nations break the vicious cycle of debt and give them the economic opportunity to liberate their futures. This issue has united people of diverse interests and backgrounds from all around the world. There is a growing sense across the cultural and political spectrum that debt burdens are a major impediment to economic reform and the alleviation of the abject poverty facing the world's poorest countries. And there is increasing certainty that debt forgiveness--if done right--can be a positive force for change in the developing world. Our resolution makes clear that the objectives of debt relief should be the promotion of policies that promote economic growth, openness to trade and investment, and the development of free markets. I am glad the full Senate is joining us in this endeavor. \\n   Today, Mr. President, the world's poorest countries owe an average of $400 for every man, woman, and child within their borders. This is much more than most people in these countries make in a year--in fact more than one billion people on Earth today live on less than a dollar a day. Debt service payments in many cases consume a majority of a poor country's annual budget, leaving scarce domestic resources for economic restructuring or such vital human services as education, clean water and sanitary living conditions. In Tanzania, for example, debt payments would require nearly four-fifths of the government's budget. In a country where one child in six dies before the age of five, little money remains to finance initiatives that would improve the country's economic prospects, its openness to trade and investment, or the standard of living of its people. Among sub-Saharan African countries--many of the very countries we're looking to help in the trade package before us today--one in five adults can't read or write. \\n   Mr. President, the problems in the developing countries that yield such grim statistics will never be solved without a monumental commitment of will from their leaders, their citizens, and the outside world. We cannot solve all these problems today. Rather, we are simply affirming to the world that the small step of debt relief is one that can and should be taken without delay. \\n   The effort to forgive the debts of the world's poorest countries has been ongoing for more than a decade. During this time the international community and the G7 came to the realization that the world's poorest countries are simply unable to repay the debt they owe to foreign creditors. What's more, the payments that are being made are hampering progress toward more free, open, and economically vibrant economies. The external debt for many developing nations is more than twice their gross domestic product, leaving many unable to even make interest payments. We must accept the fact that this debt is unpayable. The question is not whether we'll ever get paid back, but rather what we can encourage these heavily indebted countries to do for themselves in exchange for our forgiveness. \\n   In Uganda, for example, debt relief obtained under the existing debt forgiveness programs has cleared the way for a doubling of classroom size, allowing twice as many children to attend school as before. This type of benefit is real. It is tangible. And it will bring untold benefits to the country in future years. We must do more to encourage these types of programs and debt relief is one vehicle that can help effect real change in the developing world. \\n   Prudent debt relief is in all of our best interests. It is an investment in the commitment of the world's poorest countries to implement sound economic reforms and help their people live longer, healthier and more prosperous lives. \\n   Our amendment today is another step toward this goal and I thank my colleagues for their support. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19991028\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the very important trade package that the Senate is currently considering. At a time when our global marketplace is expanding faster than ever, we need to ensure that the poorest countries around the world are not left behind. \\n   This comprehensive package uses trade to promote economic self-sufficiency, at the same time allowing for broader access to American goods and services to these markets. While many believe the economic and financial answer for these underdeveloped countries may lie in direct financial assistance, I believe the answer is found by facilitating direct private investment. \\n   I want to share with colleagues the plight of one of these countries which I experienced firsthand this past weekend. I spent 2 days in Haiti meeting with political, business, and humanitarian groups. \\n   By far, the most dramatic portion of my trip was witnessing the extreme poverty and despair that grips that Nation. I saw the face of an economy suffering from 17-percent inflation and unemployment of between 60 and 80 percent. \\n   Let me tell the story of one little boy I met. Only through a humanitarian organization and through the support of private donations is this 9-year-old boy able to obtain an education. As a tool to economic and democratic stabilization, aid is simply not enough. Many children just aren't able to stay in school. They are required to work in order to contribute to their families' survival. \\n   Again, I make the point that for a good number of the people in Haiti, their per capita income is around $50 a year. A straight calculation of the per capita income is about $500. But if you look at the makeup of that distribution, you can see easily that there are literally millions of people in Haiti who live with a per capita income of around $50. \\n   If these children are to have a future, revitalization and expansion of economic opportunities are needed to reach the goal of economic self-sufficiency. By creating a framework for using trade and investment as a development tool, the United States will be fostering reform at the economic base of these countries, taking direct aim at lowering unemployment and high inflation rates. \\n   This legislation creates this framework by extending enhanced trade benefits to the countries of the Caribbean Basin. Since the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, U.S. imports from Caribbean countries have been at a distinct disadvantage. The measure would build on the existing Caribbean Basin Initiative program, often referred to as CBI, by providing additional trade benefits to Caribbean countries similar to that which Mexico and Canada currently enjoy. \\n   Since its inception, CBI has had a significant positive economic impact on both the United States and the Caribbean countries, helping to promote regional security and stability of our Caribbean neighbors. Opening this market even further, particularly following the recent devastation inflicted by hurricanes, will help to stimulate job growth by increasing exports and expanding market access to these countries for U.S. businesses. \\n   Another important component of this trade package establishes U.S. support for economic self-reliance in sub-Saharan Africa. The United States stands to benefit a great deal from a strong and prosperous Africa. By fostering growth-oriented economic policies, we will help support broader access to African markets for American goods and services. Sub-Saharan Africa makes up a market of more than 700 million people and is potentially one of the largest markets in the world. As economic reforms and market-opening measures spur growth in Africa, it will create new and bigger markets for U.S. exporters. \\n   A particularly sensitive, albeit important, provision included in both the African Growth and Opportunity Act and the Caribbean Basin Trade Enhancement Act deals with textiles. The textile and apparel industries have historically provided the first step toward industrialization in many countries. This is because production is fairly simple, can be done on a small scale, and often uses locally abundant raw material. \\n   In seeking to address the concerns raised by the U.S. textile industry, this legislation has sought compromise by restricting preferential treatment to apparel produced by U.S. fabric and yarns. \\n   Additionally, this legislation provides strong protections against illegal transshipment of goods through Africa  or eligible CBI countries. We need to ensure that these countries do not become stop-over points for products from countries not eligible for preferential treatment under the legislation. \\n   International trade has been an important part of the growth we have enjoyed in the United States. Since 1994, international trade has created more than 11 million American jobs, and accounts for 30 percent of our Nation's gross domestic product. \\n   Imports have helped to hold down inflation, lower the cost of production, provide greater choice to consumers, and have given incentives to raise productivity. \\n   As emerging markets seek to grow, it is important that the United States take the lead in offering these countries incentives to continue their economic reforms. By doing so, we will be providing the citizens of these emerging countries with more jobs, more opportunities and genuine hope. I believe a strong trade relationship is the best form of ``foreign assistance'' we can offer another country. \\n   I thank the chair, and I yield the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19991028\\n\\n   Mr. MACK.

Mr. President, I join my colleagues in paying tribute to the memory of our friend and colleague, Senator John Chafee. \\n   Senator Chafee was the living embodiment of Senate decorum. He always honored this body through his thoughts, deeds and actions. His ideas and messages were delivered thoughtfully and respectfully. He truly followed his heart and soul while representing the people of Rhode Island and this great nation. \\n   His honorable service in both World War II and the Korean Conflict, as well as his distinguished tenure as Secretary of the Navy, reflect his profound respect for America's armed forces and his deep love of country. \\n   I am especially appreciative for all he did to advance causes near and dear to the state of Florida. He took time to visit the Florida Everglades, and his work on this important issue will ensure the preservation of this unique natural system, and will always be a part of his lasting legacy. \\n   Senator Chafee devoted his life to public service. He will be remembered as a thoughtful and patriotic American who cared passionately about those he served, the issues he fought for, and the institution of the United States Senate. He was not only a fellow Republican, but a colleague who was respected on both sides of the aisle. He will be sorely missed in the U.S. Senate. \\n   My heartfelt sympathies go to his wife Ginny, to their five children and 12 grandchildren, and to his staff here in Washington and throughout Rhode Island. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19991021\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I extend a warm welcome to Father Dan this morning. He is our guest Chaplain this morning from Reynoldsburg, OH. I had the pleasure of meeting him a few moments ago, but in a sense I have known him for at least a number of years because my brother, Andrew McGillicuddy, is a member of his parish--Andy and Chris--and as a result of their request, Father Dan was able to join us this morning. He is the pastor of a church of 2,400 families, a great responsibility. We are delighted he is with us this morning. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19991021\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today the Senate will resume consideration of the pending Harkin amendment to the partial-birth abortion ban bill. By previous consent, there are 2 hours of debate on the amendment. Therefore, Senators can anticipate a vote at approximately 11:30 a.m., unless the time is yielded back on the amendment. Senators should be aware future rollcall votes are expected in an attempt to complete action on the bill prior to adjournment today. \\n   Following the completion of the partial-birth abortion ban bill, the Senate may begin consideration of any legislative items on the calendar or any conference reports available for action. \\n   I thank my colleagues for their attention. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19991021\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, Senator JOHN BREAUX, in introducing the Fuel Tax Equalization Credit for Substantial Power Takeoff Act. \\n   This bill would create a simple mechanism to reimburse owners of concrete mixers and sanitation trucks for the Federal excise taxes that they pay on fuels used to power the off-road function of their vehicles. \\n   Today, IRS regulations impose the Federal fuels excise tax on ``single engine, dual-use vehicles.'' Two prominent examples of such single-engine, dual-use vehicles are concrete mixers and sanitation trucks. The IRS taxes the entire amount of fuel used in these vehicles, despite the fact that a substantial portion of the fuel consumed is used to power an off-road function--the trash compactor of a sanitation truck, or the rotating drum of the cement truck. \\n   Mr. President, the Federal fuels excise tax is meant to pay for our Nation's roads. If fuel is used for an off-road purpose, it is a well-established principle that we do not tax the fuel. In this case, fuels used to power the trash compactor or rotate the drum on a concrete mixer do not result in wear and tear on the roads and, therefore, should not be taxes. \\n   Contrary to this well-established principle, the IRS imposes the excise tax on single engine, dual-use vehicles. The simple reason given by the IRS for this distinction is administrative convenience. But the convenience of the IRS is no reason to overtax diesel fuel consumers. \\n   Mr. President, our bill corrects the discrepancy created under IRS regulations, and does so without creating any administrative red tape. The $250 income tax credit crafted in the bill would be easy to administer. While it will not fully and precisely compensate these truck owners for the taxes paid on fuel used off-road, this credit has been calculated based on industry data and using conservative estimates, and reduces a tax that these truck owners should not be paying in the first place. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to join Senator BREAUX and me in supporting this important piece of legislation. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19991018\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Madam President, as Congress considers various plans to overhaul the current campaign finance system, I think everyone can agree on one fact: the status quo is indefensible. The system needs to change in order to restore the American people's faith in their government. \\n   The imbalances which exist in our election laws today were created by the Federal Election Campaign Act in the name of equality. They resulted in unfair advantages which are institutionalized in the name of fairness, protecting some forms of political speech while criminalizing others. Enacting more laws along the same lines will only lead us further down the path of destruction. Freedom matters. Freedom works. Free speech works. Free participation works. The current system does not. If we want real reform, we will scrap this bill, repeal current law, and start over. \\n   Campaign finance reformers think the solution is new regulations and methods that I believe work only to preclude participation in politics. They believe that new laws, more restrictions, and additional bureaucracy are the answer. This position is based upon the assumption that current laws are working and they just need a few modifications to make them better. I  strongly disagree. Freedom of expression is an end in itself and can not be subordinated to any other goals of society. Information is the backbone to freedom, ignorance is the backbone to oppression. \\n   Reformers tolerate these inequalities because they believe they will result in lower-cost elections, less influence in the process by special interests, and will make the electoral system more accessible to challengers. Even if these goals could be achieved in this way, the trampling of the First Amendment in the process is unacceptable. \\n   The fact is, current laws do not work. Let's admit that. We wouldn't be debating this issue if they did. They were passed in haste, as a knee-jerk reaction to the Watergate era, and while they were enacted with good intentions, their result has been a disaster. We should recognize that a mistake was made when the Federal Election Campaign Act was enacted, and no modifications to this law will improve the system. \\n   Campaign finance laws restricting free speech should be repealed, and the absolute freedom to engage in the political process should be promoted and defended. The American people should know that their participation is encouraged, respected, and welcome. If that participation includes fully disclosed contributions to candidates and parties, so be it. Disclosure is the key factor here. Let's give the American people some credit. They are smart enough to judge for themselves where conflicts of interest lie. They do not need the bureaucracy of the Federal Elections Commission to police their speech and thwart their involvement. The only job of the FEC should be the posting and reporting of all contributions in a timely manner so that the American people can judge for themselves. Current law is an insult to the intelligence of the American people. \\n   Soft money is perceived as a loophole in current law. Banning soft money is only one more step toward the elimination of free speech in elections. The First Amendment right to freedom of speech is not a loophole. It is a fundamental freedom that protects, among other things, political speech. Again, let Americans \\n   decide whether and to what extent they want to participate. \\n   We should be protecting freedom of speech over everything else. We should not enact legislation to preclude the public from voicing their opinions on the work we do here. We may not like what is said about us, but we can all agree that people have a right to speak their mind, especially their political mind. \\n   This bill also recognizes that current law does not protect working Americans' ability to decide which causes they will support. While this bill codifies the Beck decision which enables non-union workers to request a refund for the portion of their union fees used for political causes. If it does not address the concerns of union members who are forced to participate in political causes without their consent. \\n   No American should be faced with the direct or indirect threat of losing their job because of their political beliefs. No one should be forced to participate in advocating for a cause or causes they find repugnant. The rights of individuals to be free certainly extends to their political beliefs and the way in which they choose to participate or not to participate. No forced participation under any guise should be tolerated or encouraged. Let individuals make choices for themselves. That is the most fundamental freedom in a democracy. \\n   A vibrant democracy depends on the ability of all voices to be heard, and how loudly one may wish to speak should be limited only by that individual, not by government. If an individual can and is willing to expend over $1,000 in support of a candidate, they should be able to do so. If they wish to express their support with their time or in any other fashion, then this, too, should be applauded and encouraged. And if individuals wish to ignore the political process altogether, then this, too, is a right to be defended. To tinker with this fundamental right gives power to some at the expense of others. \\n   Finally, I would submit, that we need to re-examine our attitude toward money in the electoral process, and I would propose that spending money to communicate one's message is not the root of all evil in politics. Candidates for public office have the important task of getting their message out to the voters. In statewide races across the country, candidates must spend substantial amounts of money for print and electronic media, since it is the best current method of reaching the maximum audience. \\n   Take a moment and think about the power of the media today--television, newspapers and radio frame the debates of important issues. A candidate must be able to raise enough money to get his or her message out to the public. \\n   When I was campaigning for my Senate seat back in 1988, I faced enormous opposition from the newspapers. Newspapers have vast resources to openly campaign for a candidate. Had I not had the freedom and ability to counter their message, I would not be a Senator today. \\n   True reform will not strip candidates, parties, or individuals of their ability to counter the messages in the media. True reform should recognize the imbalance current law has created, and would seek to level the playing field between candidates and the media. Remember, the First Amendment protects freedom of the press, but it also protects the freedom of individuals to speak loud and clear. \\n   Madam President, I believe in the First Amendment. Protecting that right must be our primary goal. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19991005\\n\\n    Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from Maryland, Mr. SARBANES, to introduce the Debt Relief for Counties Act of 1999. This bill simply forgives much of the debt owed to us by the world's poorest countries in exchange for commitments from these countries to reform their economies and work toward a better quality of life for their people. Our effort today is premised on the fact that we must help these poverty-stricken nations break the vicious cycle of debt and give them the economic opportunity to liberate their futures. I ask my colleagues to join me in this worthwhile effort. \\n   Today, the world's poorest countries owe an average of $400 for every man, woman, and child within their borders. This is much more than most people in these countries make in a year. Debt service payments in many cases consume a majority of a poor country's annual budget, leaving scarce domestic resources for economic restructuring or such vital human services as education, clean water and sanitary living conditions. In Tanzania, for example, debt payments would require nearly four-fifths of the government's budget. In a country where one child in six dies before the age of five, little money remains to finance public health programs. Among Sub-Saharan African countries, one in five adults can't read or write, and it is estimated that in several countries almost half the population does not have access to safe drinking water. \\n   Mr. President, the problems that yield such grim statistics will never be solved without a monumental commitment of will from their leaders, their citizens, and the outside world. That is not what we propose to do here today. Our bill is only a small step in the right direction, but it is one we can do quickly and for relatively little cost. \\n   The effort to forgive the debts of the world's poorest countries has been ongoing for more than a decade. During this time the international community and the G7 came to the realization that the world's poorest countries are simply unable to repay the debt they owe to foreign creditors. The external debt for many of the developing nations is more than twice their GDP, leaving many unable to even pay the interest on their debts. We must accept the fact that this debt is unpayable. the question is not whether we'll ever get paid back, but rather what we can encourage these heavily indebted countries to do for themselves in exchange for our forgiveness. \\n   Our bill requires the President to forgive at least 90 percent of the entire bilateral debt owed by the world's heavily indebted poor countries in exchange for verifiable commitments to pursue economic reforms and implement poverty alleviation measures. While roughly $6 billion is owed to the United States by these poor countries, it is estimated the cost of forgiving this debt would be less than ten percent of that amount. The U.S. share of the bilateral debt is less than four percent of the total, but our action would provide leadership to the rest of the world's creditor nations and provide some savings benefits to these countries as well. \\n   Our bill also requires a restructuring of the IMF and World Bank's Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC). This program was begun in 1996, but to date only three countries \\n   have received any relief. While the premise of HIPC is sound, its shortcomings have become evident during the implementation. It promises much, but in reality it benefits too few countries, offers too little relief, and requires too long a wait before debt is forgiven. A process of reforming the HIPC was begun this year during the G7's meeting in Cologne, and our bill meets or exceeds the standards set out in the Cologne communique. \\n   Specifically, we shorten the waiting period for eligibility from six to three years. We extend the prospect of relief to more countries. And we ensure that savings realized from the relief will be used to enhance ongoing economic reforms in addition to initiatives designed to alleviate poverty. This is a sound and balanced approach to help these poor countries correct their underlying economic problems and improve the standard of living of their people. \\n   Mr. President, this legislation is not a handout to the developing world. Rather, it is an investment in these countries' commitment to implementing sound economic reforms and helping their people live longer, healthier and more prosperous lives. In order to receive debt relief under our bill, countries must commit the savings to policies that promote growth and expand citizens' access to basic services like clean water and education. \\n   We have included a strict prohibition in our bill on providing relief to countries that sponsor terrorism, spend excessively on their militaries, do not cooperate on narcotics matters, or engage in systematic violations of their citizens' human rights. We are not proposing to help any country that is not first willing to help itself. \\n   Mr. President, the debt accumulated in the developing world throughout the Cold War and into the 1990s has become a significant impediment to the implementation of free-market economic reforms and the reduction of poverty. We in the developed world have an interest in removing this impediment and providing the world's poorest countries with the opportunity to address their underlying economic problems and set a course for sustainability. \\n   I believe our bill is an important first step in this process and I look forward to the support of my colleagues in the Senate.  \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990928\\n\\n    Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend and colleague Senator ABRAHAM, to introduce the Merit Act, which is legislation to ensure that every classroom in America is staffed with a competent, qualified and caring teacher. Last Congress, the Senate debated a number of initiatives to further this goal and passed this legislation as an amendment to a comprehensive education reform bill, which was vetoed by the President. Earlier this year, I joined Senator GREGG in cosponsor the Teacher Empowerment Act. Both the TEA, and the MERIT ACT are important reform bills to enable local schools to staff their classrooms with the best and brightest teachers. \\n   The 21st Century begins in just under 100 days. If our children are to be prepared for the challenges ahead, educational excellence must become our first order of business. As Congress continues to focus on a number of important reforms to federal K-12 education policy, I strongly believe that any real education reform must confront the most basic, the most important, and the most neglected aspect of public education: the quality of instruction in the classroom. \\n   Parents all over the state of Florida, and I imagine the same is true around the country, are concerned that the success --or failure--of their child's entire academic year will be determined by the quality and expertise of their child's teacher. Studies show that the most important factor in determining student success on standardized tests is the teacher's ability to present the material. Studies also show that when a student is assigned an ineffective teacher, the damage is not limited to one year. In fact, student test scores do not recover for three years, even if their subsequent teachers are excellent. \\n   America's classrooms are staffed with many dedicated, knowledgeable, and hardworking teachers. Nevertheless, the case for sweeping reform is not difficult to make. While the United States already spends more money per pupil than virtually any industrialized democracy in the world, our children frequently score near the bottom in international exams in science and math. Without exceptional teaching, no amount of resources will be able to turn bad schools into good schools. Throwing more money at the problem is no longer the answer. \\n   Our schools and classrooms should be staffed with teachers who have the appropriate training and background. Students deserve teachers with a thorough knowledge of the subjects they are teaching and the ability to convey complex material in ways that students can understand. One way to determine the competency of teachers would be to test them on their knowledge of the subject areas they teach. \\n   At a time when states are raising the bar for student achievement, few are raising standards for teachers. Today, seven states have no licensing exams for new teachers, and of the \\n   43 states that do have licensing exams, only 29 require high school teachers to pass an exam in the subject they plan to teach. However, in many cases, these requirements are waived when there is a shortage of qualified candidates. \\n   We have a clear interest in ensuring that beginning teachers are able to meet high standards and are knowledgeable about the subject matter they are presenting, and a number of states have taken the initiative to test their prospective teachers. However, when you consider that many teachers--especially teachers in low income districts--do not even have a minor degree in the subject they teach, it is important to periodically evaluate the performance of all teachers. Schools are often strapped for good teachers and will simply staff a science class with a math teacher. These are cases where testing could provide valuable insight as to the mastery of the teacher in additional subjects, and would identify those teachers who need additional encouragement. \\n   Common sense also dictates that we should not concentrate all our attention on under-performing teachers. We must also recognize that there are many great teachers who are successfully challenging their students on a daily basis. Today, our public schools compensate teachers based almost solely on seniority, not on their performance inside the classroom. Merit-pay would differentiate between teachers who are hard-working and inspiring, and those who fall short. \\n   The legislation we are introducing today, known as the MERIT ACT--which stands for Measures to Enhance Results in Teaching --is the same legislation that passed the Senate last Congress with bipartisan support by a vote of 63-35. It rewards states that test its teachers on their subject matter knowledge, and pays its teachers based on merit. \\n   Here is how it works: we will make half of any additional funding over the FY 2000 level for the Eisenhower Professional Development Program available to states that periodically test elementary and secondary school teachers, and reward teachers based on merit and proven performance. There will be no reduction in current funding to states under this program based on this legislation. As funding increases for this program, so will the amount each state receives. Incentives will and should be provided to those states that take the initiative to establish teacher testing and merit pay programs. \\n   Again, I want to emphasize that all current money being spent on this program is unaffected by this legislation. Only additional money will be used as an incentive for states to enact teacher testing and merit pay programs. \\n   Finally, this legislation enables states to also use federal education money to establish and administer teacher testing and merit pay programs. This broad approach will enable states to staff their schools with the best and most qualified teachers, thereby enhancing learning for all students. In turn, teachers can be certain that all of their energy, dedication and expertise will be rewarded. And it can be done without placing new mandates on states or increasing the federal bureaucracy. \\n   It is interesting to note that as Governor of the State of Arkansas, Bill Clinton enthusiastically supported teacher testing, and as Governor of South Carolina, Secretary of Education Richard Riley advocated a merit-pay plan. In fact, then-Governor Clinton in 1984 said that he was more convinced than ever that competency tests were needed to take inventory of teachers' basic skills. He said, ``Teachers who don't pass the test shouldn't be in the classroom''. While President Clinton vetoed this legislation last year, I am hoping he will stand by his State of the Union address where he stated that new teachers should be required to pass performance exams and all teachers should know the subject matter they are teaching. \\n   I would also like to mention the important steps being taken by schools around the country to address the need for merit-based pay. Most recently, in Denver, Colorado, schools have reached an agreement with the unions to commence a two year demonstration program which will pay teachers based on  performance. It is important to note the two largest unions, the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers, have approached the Denver plan with an open mind. In this program, teachers can earn an additional $1500 by the end of an academic year if a majority of the teacher's students ``improve.'' I am encouraged by the initiative taken by Denver's schools to implement innovative approaches to teacher compensation, and I look forward to the continued cooperation of America's teacher unions. Without their cooperation, reforms to education in America are often frustrated. In the end, I believe teachers, administrators, parents and students will be able to devise a system that is fair and one that works to improve teacher and student performance alike. \\n   I look forward to working with my colleagues as we continue the fight to give dedicated professionals who teach our children a personal stake in the quality of the instruction they provide. I hope there will again be broad, bipartisan support for this bill.  \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-19990928\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, Senator GRAHAM and I rise again to introduce the Florida Coast Protection Act of 2000. This legislation will amend current law to give states the ability to have all pertinent environmental information on hand before they are forced to rule on oil and gas drilling development plans, and it would also implement a permanent ban on leasing in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico. \\n   Mr. President, Floridians have always been justifiably concerned about the prospect of oil and gas exploration in the waters off our coast. We are well aware of the risk this activity poses to our environment and our economy because, in Florida, a healthy environment means a healthy economy. Millions of people come to Florida each year to enjoy the climate, our beaches, and our fine quality of life. The tourism industry in Florida provides millions of jobs and generates revenues in the billion of dollars. It would take only one disaster to end Florida's good standing as America's vacationland. We cannot afford to let that happen. \\n   Throughout my tenure in the Senate I have opposed exploration and drilling off Florida's coasts. My goal--and the goal of the entire Florida Congressional delegation--is to permanently remove this threat from Florida's coast. In recent years, we have stood together in opposition to drilling and have successfully extended the annual moratorium on all new leasing activities on Florida's continental shelf. While the opposition of Floridians to oil drilling is well-documented, the reality remains that leases have been issued, potential drilling sites have been explored, and it is likely that actual extraction of resources could take place within the next few years. \\n   In order to prevent a repeat of the past mistake of leasing in the OCS off Florida, our legislation makes permanent the ban on any new leasing activity within 100 miles of our coast. In addition, it gives states the flexibility to make a determination regarding the consistency of oil and gas development and production plans as required by the Coastal Zone Management Act after an environmental impact statement detailing the direct and cumulative impacts of the project is completed by the Minerals Management Service. \\n   It is this second provision which is so important. Many in this body may not be aware that my state is currently engaged in a battle to keep drilling rigs off its coasts. In the process, the government of the state of Florida was forced, by current law, to make a consistency determination on a pending development plan without the benefit of the environmental impact statement. In fact, the state was forced to conclude that the plan is inconsistent with its own coastal zone management  program months before the environmental impact statement was concluded. As I stand here, the EIS for this development plan is still not finalized and its draft is currently the subject of public hearings. Without the benefit of this detailed study, the state is unable to accurately assess the primary, secondary and cumulative impacts drilling will have on our coast, estuaries, marine life and our economy. No state should be put in a similar position and our bill seeks to correct this. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990924\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Given the merits of the project, we were disappointed that Barry University was not included in the legislation before us that allocates funds to the ``Economic Development Initiatives'' for such purposes. Barry University's proposal meets the criteria established by the Subcommittee in terms of serving low-income populations. Our hope is that this project can be re-considered during final deliberations on the bill. Specifically, we would request that favorable language be included in this bill directing the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to spend a minimum of 1.5 million dollars from the Economic Development Initiative fund to finance this important program that promotes economic and social revitalization. We would appreciate the Senator's support, along with the Chairman's in the funding of the Barry University Intercultural Community Center in the Conference Report. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990922\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend from Florida, Senator GRAHAM, to engage the distinguished Chairman, Senator BOND, in a colloquy. Specifically, I wish to make the Chairman aware of an important priority for the State of Florida which was not funded in this bill. Last year, the public housing reform act passed by Congress contained authorization for the construction of a community services student union building at Bethune-Cookman College in Daytona Beach, Florida. Accordingly, we included this project as one of our important priorities for the legislation before us today. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-19990922\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I thank the Chairman for his assurances. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-3-19990922\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend from Florida, Senator GRAHAM, to engage the distinguished Chairman, Senator BOND, in a colloquy. Specifically, I wish to make the Chairman aware of two critical projects in Florida that did not receive funding in this bill. The first is the City of West Palm Beach's water reuse project. This wetlands-based potable water reuse program is critical not only to the water supply of the City of West Palm Beach but also to the Everglades restoration effort. \\n   During dry season, the City takes water from Lake Okeechobee which is a critical primary source of water for the Everglades. West Palm Beach is attempting to eliminate this water use through their innovative water reuse project. The City has received federal support in each of the past three fiscal years. Work is progressing on schedule, but a final installment of federal funding is needed to complete the work and bring the project on line. \\n   I would point out to the Chairman that this project is funded in the House VA/HUD and Independent Agencies appropriations bill. I would urge the Chairman to work with our House colleagues during the upcoming conference to ensure that funding for this critical project is completed in this fiscal year. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-4-19990922\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I thank the Chairman for his assurances. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-5-19990922\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend from Florida, Senator GRAHAM, to engage the distinguished Chairman, Senator BOND, in a colloquy. Specifically, I wish to make the Chairman aware of an important priority for the State of Florida which was not funded in this bill. The city of Sarasota, Florida has long been working with the federal government to address its water treatment system problems. Many of the city's residents are still on septic tanks and the federal government has been interested in addressing this problem because of polluted runoff into the Sarasota Bay National Estuary. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-6-19990922\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I thank the Chairman for his assurances. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990914\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. The Refuge currently co-exists with Florida's Space Coast. However, sea turtle nesting at this site is sensitive to impacts from development and human activity. To mitigate these impacts, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service coordinates with the local and state governments regarding joint management of beaches, index nesting beach surveys, public education programs, and appropriate public use facilities. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990805\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I thank my distinguished colleague for yielding me that time. \\n   Mr. President, the vote on our tax relief bill is nothing less than a vote of confidence, reaffirmation of our belief in the wisdom of the American people and of our faith in the capitalist system. It all boils down to one basic, fundamental question: who has first claim on the income of Americans--does it belong to the government or to the individual families who create the income through the sweat of their brows and the genius of their (brains?) \\n   The President and the vast majority of our friends on the other side of the aisle act like the money belongs to the  government. They reject our tax relief bill as ``too big,'' as if taxpayers earn income at the sufferance of the government. Under this view, Uncle Sam does not live under a budget he sets the budget for every American family, which must be content with the table scraps after the enormous appetite for spending in Washington has been satiated. \\n   Two and one-quarter centuries ago, the rejection of this arrogant, government-comes-first theory of taxation was the impetus for the founding of our Nation. Our political forefathers would not stand for the notion that Americans were mere pawns of a distant court, which could raid their purses and pocketbooks at any whim. America was founded not on concepts that divide peoples, such as race, or geography, but on the American Idea that brings us all together: the inalienable right to liberty. \\n   From our Nation's very conception, this idea has served as a beacon for people of all creeds and colors seeking refuge from he heavy hand of meddlesome government. In America, the government serves the people, and must necessarily trust the people to do what is right by and for themselves. The government should not try to do it all. We provide a safety net for the least fortunate, those who cannot help themselves, but everyone else is trusted with the responsibility of providing for their own financial security. \\n   And by all accounts, this combination of liberty for our citizens and restraint on the part of the public sector has, in fact, succeeded. By the end of the 19th Century, America was in the forefront of the Industrial Revolution. By the mid-20th Century, despite the MIRE of a worldwide depression, the United States was able to mobilize its industries and its men to rout one own of the twin evils of tyranny in the Second World \\n   War. And by the close of this Century, we succeeded in defeating the other Soviet Communism, by the force of our will, the commitment of a strong Commander-in-Chief, Ronald Reagan, and the power of our competing idea of liberty. Our Nation is President Reagan's shining city on a hill, the economic envy of the world and the destination of all who yearn for freedom. \\n   But this President and his supporters in the Congress just don't get it. The tax burden on our citizens is at an all time, peacetime high--20.6 percent of the economy. Meanwhile, the federal government will be overcharging the taxpayers by more than $3 trillion over the next 10 years. A Nation that trusted its people, that protected their liberty, would not flinch from the right thing to do: cut taxes so that our families can enjoy the fruits of their labors, instead of greedy Washington programs. This tax bill does just that, leaving $792 billion in the hands of the people to whom it belongs. \\n   This tax cut is a measured, balanced response to the surpluses that will be flowing into the capital. It leaves 75% of the surpluses to be used to retire debt, and finance important priorities like Medicare and national defense. Every penny in the Social Security trust fund is left in a lockbox to be used to shore up the retirement security of our citizens. And the tax cuts are phased in over time, so the bulk of the cuts are in the last 3 years of the coming decade, when surpluses would otherwise skyrocket and tempt a government spending spree. \\n   But voices are raised in opposition to the tax cut. It is said that the government cannot afford a tax cut of this size. But that is exactly backwards: our taxpayers cannot afford to continue to shoulder a record-high tax burden. Back in 1993, without the vote of a single Republican member of Congress, President Clinton pushed through a tax increase totaling $241 billion over 5 years. The rationale for this tax increase was the need to reduce our budget deficit. Well, the budget deficit is gone and we now have surpluses as far as the eye can see. The on-budget, non-Social Security surpluses will exceed $1 trillion over the next decade. We propose to let the American people keep $792 billion of these overpayments. Is that too much? \\n   Not when you consider that the 5-year tax cut of $156 billion pales in comparison to the Clinton tax hike, imposed \\n   on what was then a much smaller economy. According to my Joint Economic Committee staff, the 1993 Clinton tax increases will take some $900 billion from the American people over the next decade. Our tax cut of $792 billion does not even offset the lingering ill effects of that tax hike. Are we being too generous? Or have the taxpayers been too generous for too long? \\n   It is hard to find fault with the specifics of our tax cut package. Is it right that we should double-tax business investments, so our innovators lack the resources for research and development? Is it wrong to extend the R&D tax credit, to liberate our scientists and engineers? Is it right that people should pay higher taxes just because they are married? Do we want people to build their own nest eggs for retirement security, or do we want to force everyone to rely exclusively on the Social Security system? \\n   This tax relief package helps everyone. We make health and long-term care insurance fully deductible, and allow a dependent deduction for elderly family members. Education is more affordable through enhanced savings vehicles--IRAs and pre-paid tuition plans. Tax rates are lowered across-the-board. We eliminate the marriage penalty for taxpayers in the lowest tax bracket and repeal the Alternative Minimum Tax for individuals. \\n   Most significant is what this tax relief does for our future. As we enter the 21st Century, America needs a tax policy that will facilitate, not smother, innovation and new technology. Our tax relief bill improves the environment for pioneers in new products and services. The R&D tax credit is extended for 5 years--the longest extension ever, so business can count on it. The R&D credit will continue to fuel innovation in new technologies, leading to health and safety breakthroughs, and enriching our quality of life. \\n   Capital gains tax rates are also cut to their lowest levels in 58 years. Lower taxes on capital gains will help our entrepreneurs find the seed capital they need to launch new businesses, create new jobs and provide new products and services. And capital gains are indexed, eliminating the tax on phantom gains due to inflation--ending the government raid on the savings of long-term investors, particularly retirees. \\n   We also eliminate the most unfair tax of all, the estate \\n   and gift tax. No longer will business owners be discouraged from reinvesting their hard-earned profits because the specter of the federal death tax is hovering, waiting to swoop down and scoop up 55 percent of the increased value of the business. By eliminating the death tax, cutting the capital gains tax, and expanding IRAs, some of the largest barriers to capital formation are pulled down, and the result should be a rising tide of investment that carries our economy through the coming Century of Knowledge. \\n   I want to commend Chairman ROTH, and all of the conferees, for producing a balanced, thorough, and fair tax cut that benefits all taxpayers. High taxes are an infringement on the liberty of our families, who should not be struggling to make ends meet while their Federal servants hoard the wealth our families have created. When the question comes down to whether we trust the Federal Government or the family to use money wisely, I choose the family every time. I urge my colleagues to do the same, to side with the people, not the bureaucracy, and vote for the conference report. \\n   I yield the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990805\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from Florida, Mr. GRAHAM, to address briefly the issue of Everglades restoration and land acquisition funding. We had joined with the President in requesting slightly more than $100 million for land acquisition in Everglades National Park, state assistance grants, infrastructure investment, and modified water deliveries to the Park and Florida Bay. This funding is critical to keep the restoration effort on budget, on schedule, and consistent with the Congress' commitment in 1997 to fully fund Everglades restoration. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-19990805\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, the reservations of the Subcommittee are valid ones and my colleague from Florida and I are willing to be helpful however we can in addressing these concerns. I would say to the Chairman that we are making progress on these issues. The Department of the Interior tells me it is working closely with the State of Florida to remove the barriers to allocating the unobligated land acquisition and restoration balances. The Department assures these funds will be obligated by the end of this fiscal year. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-3-19990805\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I would ask the Chairman of the Subcommittee if he would be willing--given the movement toward resolving his concerns since release of the Committee's report--if he would be willing to work with us in Conference to increase the overall Everglades funding from the levels currently in the bill? \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-4-19990805\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I thank my colleague for his response and assurances on this important issue. I would also like to mention briefly the funding level for the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force. It is my understanding the Task Force's funding has been kept steady at $800,000 since it was statutorily authorized in 1996. I want to bring this matter to the Chairman's attention because of the restraints this low funding ceiling is placing on the Task Force's ability to carry out its mission in South Florida. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-5-19990805\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I thank my friend from Washington and yield the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990805\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join my colleagues, Senator MIKULSKI, Senator WELLSTONE, and Senator GRAMS, in sponsoring the Medicare's Elderly Receiving Innovative Treatments (MERIT) Act of 1999. \\n   This legislation ensures that frail elderly persons residing in nursing homes continue to have the opportunity for improved quality of care and better health outcomes provided by the EverCare program. This program is reimbursed by Medicare on a capitated fee basis to managed care organizations that deliver preventive and primary medical care geared to the special needs of this population. Care is given by nurse practitioner/physician primary care teams which also coordinate care when the patient is hospitalized. Ideally, as much care as possible is provided at the nursing home thus preventing the expense of hospitalization. A major goal is to maintain stability in the patients' life by caring for them in their place of residence. The typical patient is over 85, 82 percent are female, 75 percent are on Medicaid and 70 percent have dementia. \\n   The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) requires the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) to establish a new risk-adjusted methodology for payments to health plans which is to go into effect on January 1, 2000. An interim risk adjusted payment will be based on inpatient hospital encounter data. However, an unintended consequence of this methodology may be a dramatic drop in EverCare payments by more than 40 percent, according to Long Term Care Data Institute study. This would jeopardize the program, which is currently comprised of demonstration and non-demonstration components, since providers could not afford to remain in business. HCFA recognized the possibly of this and did grant an exemption from the interim methodology for one year, 2000-2001. HCFA, however, has not yet presented a methodology that would be fair and adequate to ensure the continuance of EverCare. \\n   This legislation exempts programs serving the frail elderly living in nursing homes from the phased in risk-adjustment payment methodology and continues payments using the current system. It directs HCFA to develop a distinct payment methodology which meets the needs of these patients and to establish performance measurement standards. It also allows the frail elderly to join EverCare on a continual basis without regard to enrollment periods. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990804\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition to the amendment before us today by the Senator from Mississippi. While I know my friends who support this amendment have the best of intentions in offering the agricultural relief package, I must say I am concerned with the direction of this debate. \\n   We find ourselves today, Mr. President, in an increasingly familiar place. Once again, there is a crisis in farm country and the Congress is called on to construct a comprehensive package of relief and support. The amendment before us would spend more than $7 billion on--among other things--direct cash payments to farmers. This follows our efforts last year when we provided just short of $6 billion in emergency payments to America's farmers. Since 1988 emergency supplemental acts and farm disaster acts have amounted to approximately $17 billion in emergency supplemental funding for USDA programs. \\n   Now I understand that much of this money was spent helping farmers who had suffered crop losses through drought, seasonal storms and other natural disasters. In fact, a portion of last year's emergency appropriations went to farmers who were harmed by weather conditions related to the El Nino phenomenon and other acts of God. \\n   In other words, we were attempting to help farmers in previous years because times were bad. What concerns me about this effort today is that we are helping farmers because times are good. Increasingly in these relief bills we are seeing the bulk of support going in response to low commodity prices. In fact, much of the rhetoric we're hearing is going to the issue of declining farm income and the difficulty farmers in the heartland and elsewhere are having finding markets for their goods. \\n   Today we're not addressing a crisis borne of declining productivity. It is not that America's farmer's aren't extremely good at what they do. Rather exactly the opposite. We are here because--stimulated by science and technology--farm productivity has persistently grown more rapidly than other sectors of the economy. More importantly, agricultural productivity has outstripped demand. And it leaves us faced with the one of the most basic economic functions: in the face of overwhelming supply and insufficient demand, prices will fall. \\n   In nearly all sectors, this phenomenon is a quiet one. The ``unseen hand'' of the market in most cases allocates resources among the population and prevents market saturation. But in the farm sector, Congress is often asked to intervene in this process and all too often in the past, we have. For far too long, we have allowed politics rather than economics to allocate agricultural resources and determine business success or failure. As seen by the overwhelming failure this century of centrally planned economies across the globe, political allocation leads to economic stagnation and long-term failure. \\n   It is for these reasons I fear our continued subsidization of the farm sector thwarts the free market process and will ultimately harm well-run farms by enabling continued market saturation. I understand the production of food is essential to the past and future of our country. I also recognize the instability and risk farmers face on a year to year basis and appreciate the need for occasional assistance. The New York Times, for example, contains an article yesterday discussing the drought disaster facing farmers in Maryland and West Virginia and the need for assistance in those areas. I do not discount the need for federal disaster relief. In Florida, Agriculture is a major part of our economy, and certainly there have been circumstances when we've called on Congress to assist us after hurricanes or winter freezes. These natural events warrant Congressional consideration and our best efforts. However, it seems our debate here is increasingly about politics rather than economics or weather-related disasters. \\n   In 1996, the Congress passed a Farm Bill which provided farmers of our major export crops with direct payments to transition them off the old subsidy programs and onto the free market. These direct payments were supposed to diminish each year until 2002. Instead, we are here--for the second year in a row--considering legislation to increase these payments. Once again, Congress is using emergency payments to undo the 1996 Farm Bill and circumvent the free market. I hear my colleagues blaming the free market for price failures and I find this to be a somewhat misguided notion. In fact, the market is working all too well; the overcapacity in agriculture that was papered over by government price supports for generations is now in full view. And the results are evident in the low commodity prices we're seeing on the markets today. \\n   I support the ideals and practices of family farming. I do not, however, support continually subsidizing businesses that fail. This is wasteful and destructive. By paying farmers who are unable to make profits in farming, you only delay their ultimate failure, and deter them from seeking other alternatives for income and employment. In addition, these farms that would otherwise fail still can produce crops that dilute the market and drive prices down, thereby creating a vicious cycle that we are seeing realized in this year's crisis in farm country. \\n   This problem far outstrips any two-day debate on emergency cash payments for farmers. What we need, Mr.  President, is long-term structural solutions that solve the underlying problems of oversupply in the face of insufficient world demand. One major impediment to the movement of people out of the farming sector and into other areas of the economy is the punitive capital gains taxes owed by farmers who sell their land. I will be introducing legislation soon to repeal the capital gains tax on the sale of farmland. This will allow farmers to realize an additional dollar in five on the sale of their land. They can then use this money to help them in the transition to non-farm businesses or work. While I agree with my colleagues that we need solutions to the crisis in American agriculture, I submit we need solutions that solve the underlying economic problems rather than patchwork measures that do little more than treat the symptoms and defer the problem to another year and another Congress. \\n   Mr. President, my opposition to this amendment is not based on a disdain or lack of appreciation for American agriculture. On the contrary, I believe it is a vital part of our economy and food security is clearly in our national interest. But the farming way of life is not served by government handout and bailouts of alarming size and regularity. Rather--like most other businesses--it is only preserved through sound business practices, hard work and an understanding of market fundamentals. Agriculture does not operate outside of the laws of supply and demand, and I urge my colleagues to carefully consider the long-term impact of continual subsidization on this important sector of the American economy. \\n   I hope my colleagues will oppose this amendment and explore ways to help farmers who are facing natural disasters rather than price disasters. We cannot allow the short-term politics to deter us from the long-term effort to steer agriculture towards the free market. Nobody wants to see failure in America. Nobody wants to see families lose their farms. Nobody wants the agrarian way of life in America to fade from existence. For these very reasons, Congress has an obligation to stay the course and lay the free-market groundwork for a prosperous farm economy. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990804\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the amendment my colleague from Florida, Senator GRAHAM, and I have offered on behalf of the Florida Center for Climate Prediction. \\n   The Center is a consortium between the University of Florida, Florida State University and the University of Miami to study climate variability in the Southeast region. The objective of this unique partnership is to explore the potential value and practical application for long-term climate data and science to the agricultural community in my state and throughout the Southeast. \\n   The consortium's purpose is to develop and evaluate a useful set of tools and methodologies for assessing the regional agricultural consequences of the El Nino/La Nina phenomenons and applying these forecasts to agricultural decision-making. This is a truly innovative project and I am pleased this partnership is making good progress on these important agricultural issues. \\n   Our amendment will provide $300,000 in funding for the Center in the Federal administration section of the Cooperative State Research and Education, and extension Service [CSREES]--Research and Education Activities section of the bill before us today. I appreciate the support my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee provided this important research initiative.  \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990804\\n\\n    Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990803\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I thank the Chair. \\n   First, I want to address a point that was made a few moments ago, an argument that went something like this: If we were to open up our markets, that action would, in essence, allow terrorists or countries to buy more food products. I just think that is fundamentally wrong. I think in fact they are buying all of the product that they can afford to buy now. And I would make the case that if they buy the product from us at a cheaper price because of it being subsidized, we are in fact subsidizing terrorist states. \\n   So I just fundamentally disagree with where the proponents of this amendment are going. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-19990803\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Sure. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-3-19990803\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Again, I say to my colleague who has raised this question that I do find it strange that at just the time when Members are coming to the floor and asking the American taxpayer to come to the aid of the American farmer, they are at the same time asking us to lift sanctions to allow them to sell products to terrorist states. \\n   I think, in fact, there is a connection between what is happening today--that is, some $6-$7 billion, depending on what this bill finally turns out to produce, $8-$9 billion in aid to American farmers, just after a few months ago with the additional aid to the American farmer--that you would find it appropriate to say to the American taxpayer: Now that you have given us this aid, we would like to have permission to sell our product to terrorist countries. I just find that unsupportable. \\n   I thank the Senator for raising the question. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-4-19990803\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. It clearly is a subsidy to the American farmer. What kind of effect it will have on the world price I do not think I am qualified to say. But it seems to me it is clear that if in fact there is a subsidy being received by the American farmer, that farmer could sell the product at a lower price.  \\n   I thank the Senator for his question. \\n   Mr. President, I oppose trade with tyrants and dictators, and I emphatically oppose subsidized trade with terrorist states. Again, make no mistake, that is exactly what this amendment does. Specifically, with my colleagues from Florida, New Jersey, and the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, we oppose the amendment to prevent any action by this body to limit the President of the United States' ability to impose sanctions on terrorist states. \\n   We had a similar vote last year, in which 67 Senators voted to oppose trade with terrorists. At the risk of stating the obvious, let me try to explain once again why the Senate should not change this position. \\n   Freedom is not free. I know my colleagues understand this simple axiom--this self-evident truth. But today we hear from our colleagues that the farmers of our Nation are undergoing a difficult time. So today, they have put before us a fundamental question: Does this great Nation, the United States of America, support freedom, or do we support terror? \\n   A few weeks ago, as I was preparing a statement on another issue, I came across a letter from His Holiness, the Dalai Lama of Tibet. In this letter the Dalai Lama says, and I quote, ``America's real strength comes not from its status as a `superpower' but from the ideals and principles on which it was founded.'' \\n   How may times have my colleagues been with me when a visiting head of state delivered to us the same message as the Dalai Lama's? I will provide one example. \\n   Last summer, the President of Romania addressed a joint session of Congress. He began his remarks by reminding us that Romania considered the United States the country of freedom and the guardian of fundamental human rights all over the world. He went on to say:  \\n   Throughout its history, your country has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed and the needy, a source of inspiration for the creative, the courageous and the achieving. It has always been, and may it ever remain, the land of the free and the home of the brave.  \\n   We are a nation founded on principles--the principles of freedom, liberty, and the respect for human dignity. And our commitment to these principles gives us our real strength today. It is that simple. \\n   I began this statement by posing a question on freedom versus terror. We know, even take for granted, the answer to that question--the United States opposes terror. But what about the strength or our commitment to these principles? On occasion, a short-term crisis can blind us--cause us to lose sight of our values and their importance to who we are and from where we derive our strength. \\n   Today's debate typifies one such moment. The poster which has been shown on this floor indicates the issue before us with respect to terrorist nations and their leaders--Qadhafi, Castro, and others. \\n   In exchange for very limited market expansion, some would take away the President's authority to restrict trade with six terrorist regimes--six countries whose combined markets represent a mere 1.7 percent of global agricultural imports; yet these minor importers perpetrate or harbor those who commit the world's greatest acts of terror. \\n   Some would have us open trade in agricultural products with these terrorists--in effect placing our principles up for sale. So what is the strength of our commitment to these principles? If we are to choose freedom over terror, what price should we expect to pay? There can be no doubt in anyone's mind the value of our commitment to freedom certainly exceeds the U.S. share of 1.7 percent of the world's agriculture market. \\n   But for those who may actually find this less clear than I do, it gets easier. The request by those who wish to trade with terrorists gets more extreme. With this amendment to language providing subsidies of U.S. agriculture, we are in effect being asked to subsidize global terrorism. The supporters of this amendment are asking the taxpayers of the United States to subsidize American farmers, who will then sell to terrorist states. \\n   The United States must not subsidize terrorist regimes. I find it unconscionable that we would even consider such a proposal. When two countries engage in a trade, even if just one commodity is being exported, both countries benefit from the exchange. So by opening agriculture exports to Iran, Sudan, Cuba, Iraq, Libya, and North Korea, we are offering direct support to the regimes in power. If they chose to purchase from the United States, they would be doing so because they see it as being in their best interest. Their benefit would be greater in this case because the products sold to terrorists would be subsidized by the U.S. taxpayer. \\n   Terrorism poses a direct threat to the United States. The terrorist threat was considerable during the cold war when the Soviet Union and its allies often backed movements or governments that justified the use of terror. The threat is even greater today, when chemical or biological weapons, no bigger than a suitcase, can bring death and devastation to tens of thousands of people. \\n   The deaths in the World Trade Center bombing or in Pan Am 103 remind of us what terrorism can produce. Another important reminder is the image of American humanitarian aircraft being blown out of the sky by Cuban Air Force MiG fighters in the Florida Straits. We are moving from a world where terrorists use dynamite or rifles to one where they may use a weapon of mass destruction. The world today is more dangerous in many ways than it was 10 years ago, and the form of that danger is terrorism, which makes it even more dangerous for the United States to engage in trade with terrorist states. \\n   So where does this leave us? With this simple principle--the United States must not trade with any nation that supports terrorism in any way, direct or indirect. We must insist that there can be no business-as-usual approach to nations that threaten our national security and national interests. We are well aware of the counterarguments. If we don't sell, some other country will, so what is the point? Or why not sell food? You can't turn wheat into a bomb, can you? Well, maybe not, but it is possible for a government that supports terror to use our food exports to win popular support, and it is possible to use the money saved by purchasing subsidized American goods for yet more terror. \\n   We can all agree that the United States must stand for freedom and against terror, and I hope the strength of our commitment to this principled stand runs deep. Today we are being asked how deeply are we committed to opposing terrorism. Make no mistake, our principles provide the real source of America's strength. If we are serious about battling terrorism, there can be no compromise with terror and no trade with terrorist nations. \\n   Mr. President, I yield the floor. \\n   Mr. FITZGERALD addressed the Chair. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990803\\n\\n    Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of the Teacher Empowerment Act, which is legislation introduced by my friend and colleague Senator GREGG. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this legislation, which responds to several critical needs facing American education. In particular, it addresses teacher quality and quantity. It addresses local control of educating our children. It requires accountability to parents and students. In short, it is a plan to ensure that every child in America is prepared for global competition in the 21st Century. \\n   The Teacher Empowerment Act recognizes the expertise of our state and local governments in educating our children. American parents trust their teachers and principals to make appropriate educational decisions for their children. In reality, Washington bureaucrats have called the shots for far too long. The results indicate that in lieu of achievement, we now have reams of paperwork and a myriad of programs to address local problems at the national level. We can and must do better. \\n   The Teacher Empowerment Act puts decision making authority back into the hands of local schools. It encourages states to implement innovative teacher reforms and high quality professional development programs to increase teacher knowledge and student achievement. Local schools would be encouraged to fund innovative programs such as teacher testing--a concept which I have strongly supported and which this body supported last year in a bipartisan vote--as well as tenure reform, merit-based pay, alternative routes to teacher certification, differential and bonus pay for teachers in high need subject areas, teacher mentoring, and in-service teacher academies. \\n   Our children are counting on us to ensure that they receive an education second to none. That starts with exceptional teachers and schools that are  able to address the individual needs of its students. This bill returns to local schools the ability and authority to accomplish these goals. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.  \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990729\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I would like to talk a few minutes about one particular provision in the tax bill we are debating, the extension of the Research & Development tax credit. Last week the Finance Committee took an historic step, and reported a bill which would have made the R&D tax credit a permanent feature of our tax code. Yesterday, unfortunately, every single member of the minority voted to sunset the provisions of the tax bill, so instead of a permanent R&D tax credit, we have a ten-year extension. \\n   Though the actions of our colleagues across the aisle prevented us from having a permanent R&D tax credit, I am pleased that the on-again, off-again nature of the credit will not undermine America's innovators for the next decade. I have long supported federal policies to increase the nation's R&D investment because of the central importance of scientific research to the health and well-being of our people, its positive contribution to our economic growth and our higher standard of living, and the improvements which add to our quality of life. \\n   Both business and government play important and complementary roles in making sure that America continues to lead the world in research and innovation. The federal role in R&D is focused on investment in long-term basic research. I will continue to do my best to increase federal R&D spending on basic research, particularly on biomedical research which leads to huge benefits to all Americans. \\n   Today, private industry plays the largest role in the nation's research effort, funding 65% of all R&D. Industry's role makes it clear ..... that if overall R&D is to increase, we must pursue policies which create a good business climate for firms to pursue long-term increases in their R&D budgets. We want America's leading-edge companies to hire new scientists, invest in new technologies and new research facilities--and the R&D tax credit provides that crucial incentive. \\n   To see the benefits of R&D, look no further than America's economic performance today. We are in the eighth consecutive year of non-inflationary growth, and technology industries deserve a large share of the credit. In fact, high-tech industries have accounted for about one-third of real GDP growth in recent years. \\n   Advancements from R&D lead to a huge number of improvements to our quality of life. The most dramatic impact of R&D on our quality of life is evident in biomedical research and health care. Here are some examples of the payoff to medical R&D: \\n   It used to be that patients with kidney failure had to undergo frequent transfusions, which are expensive, carry substantial risks, and leave many patients anemic. Many kidney patients had to cut back on work or quit their jobs, or go on public assistance. Through extensive R&D, one of America's top biotech companies created a new drug that allows the body to create red blood cells again and enables people to restore their energy. In the past decade, this drug has helped millions to remain productive. It has reduced transfusions in the United States by nearly one-fifth, and fewer people have contracted blood-born disease. \\n   Another example of the real-life benefits from R&D is the new class of drugs, developed in the late 1980s, which are giving millions of people who suffer from depression a new lease on life. Because of these new depression drugs, the cost of treating depression in the United States has plummeted--expensive psychiatric care and in-patient stays, which many could not afford, are now disappearing in favor of these new treatments. \\n   There are two telecommunications companies which invested in R&D to create new technologies to bring state-of-the-art medicine to previously underserved and remote locations. These new technologies allow transfer of high-resolution photographs, radiological images, sounds, and medical records from leading medical centers to physicians and patients in remote locations. \\n   These are just a few of hundreds of great success stories coming out of America's medical research labs--successes coming from companies responding to the R&D tax credit incentive. These examples make clear that R&D is not simply a dollars and cents issue. Federal R&D policy makes improvements to the quality of life across-the-board for all Americans. \\n   The R&D tax credit has proven its effectiveness. Numerous studies during the past decade have found that each dollar of tax credits generates between $1 and $2 of additional R&D. Therefore, taxpayers are getting a solid return on their investment in terms of greater economic growth, a higher standard of living, and in numerous cases--a longer and healthier life span. \\n   As chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, last month, along with Senator BENNETT, I hosted a high-tech summit which brought together business leaders from all across the high technology industries. One issue everyone seemed to agree on was that a permanent R&D tax credit would advance the development of new technologies, leading to breakthroughs which benefit the environment, increase transportation safety, treat serious illnesses and save lives. And on top of all this, a Coopers & Lybrand study found that a permanent extension to the credit would raise American incomes due to higher productivity growth and contribute substantially to our economic growth. \\n   The R&D tax credit has proven its worth many times over. Mr. President, though I am pleased we have extended R&D for 10 years, it is my hope that the R&D tax credit will one day be a permanent fixture in our Tax Code so it can spur innovation and economic growth throughout the next millennium. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990729\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join my colleagues, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, Mr. HELMS and Mr. ROBB, in sponsoring the Medicare Return to Home Act of 1999. \\n   This legislation will ensure that senior citizens enrolled in Medicare+Choice health plans who normally reside in continuing care retirement communities or nursing homes have the opportunity to return to the same facility after a period of hospitalization. Many of the retirement communities contain fully licensed facilities established to provide skilled nursing services to their residents when required them. Often, people choose a continuing care retirement community because of the different levels of care that will be available to them as they age in that community. These living arrangements allow couples and individuals to maintain their independence by having the ability to move in and out of various levels of care according to their needs over time. People who are fully independent when they move into a residential community often require assisted living, skilled nursing care or some other assistance over the course of their lifetime in residence. \\n   An increasing number of seniors have chosen Medicare+Choice plans as the way that they wish to receive health care services under Medicare. These plans reduce the potential for substantial out-of-pocket costs for the very sick which might be the experience with the traditional original Medicare plan. \\n   One unfortunate consequence of the Medicare+Choice option involves the inability of seniors to return to their chosen community or nursing home where they resided following a period of hospitalization. Some Medicare+Choice plans will only permit patients to be discharged from the hospital to a facility with which the Medicare+Choice plan has a contract. Then, patients cannot return to the residential community that they selected, which may have been chosen because it included a skilled nursing facility. Nor can they return to the nursing home in which they had previously resided. This can be traumatic for frail elderly patients and may contribute to their disorientation and impede their recovery. It places them in an unfamiliar setting away from home, possibly separating them from a spouse and friends. Staff at their chosen retirement community or nursing home may also be familiar with their individual needs and habits which could only assist in their return to wellness. It makes little sense for them to be sent elsewhere upon discharge from a hospital. \\n   Passage of this legislation ensures the ability of Medicare+Choice beneficiaries to return to the residential home facility of their choice or nursing home in which they previously resided following hospitalization under the following conditions: \\n   1. The enrollee chooses to return to the residential community facility where they had been living. \\n   2. The facility is licensed and qualified under state and federal law to provide the required services. \\n   3. The residential community or nursing home agrees to accept the managed care plan's payment which must be similar to the payment made to contracted facilities. \\n   This legislation provides for continuity in the lives of the elderly following a period of hospitalization. It does not increase costs to Medicare+Choice plans or to beneficiaries. \\n   It allows people to return to their loved ones in the facility where they have chosen to live. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990728\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, although I agree with many of the specific provisions in the Democrat alternative tax package--including a few bills that I have introduced--I must rise in opposition to this amendment. The plain fact is that the tax cut offered is just too small. We have budget instructions to cut taxes by $792 billion over the next 10 years, and we should cut taxes by $792 billion. \\n   I am glad I have this opportunity to talk about tax cuts, one of my favorite subjects. \\n   We are in the midst of what should be a very easy task: reducing the tax burden on our citizens by $792 billion over the next ten years. After all, over the next decade, the federal government is on track to collect over $3 trillion dollars more than we have budgeted for spending. \\n   In other words, we will be overcharging the taxpayers by $3 trillion. You would think that the suggestion to return to the taxpayers a mere 25 percent of these overpayments would not be controversial. But we have heard, over the past few months, the defenders of the status quo, the advocates of big government, raise their voices in criticism of our tax cut goal. \\n   These critics say that tax cuts are not needed, that taxpayers do not deserve to keep more of their hard earned money. It has even been suggested that the tax burden on our families has been falling. Well, the facts could not be any clearer: the federal government will tax away 20.6 percent of our nation's gross domestic product this year. That is an all-time, peacetime record, a level that was only exceeded when we mobilized to win World War II. \\n   But even though the tax burden is a record high, even though we will be overcharging the taxpayers by $3 trillion over the next decade, every excuse under the sun is being raised against tax cuts. Some of these arguments are contradictory, and all are wrong. \\n   Some argue, from a Keynesian demand-side perspective, that tax cuts will overstimulate the economy. But even after a $792 billion tax cut, the federal government will run up over $2 trillion in surpluses over the next ten years--from a Keynesian viewpoint, $2 trillion in surpluses is not considered a stimulus. And with all of the lags, the delays, and the phase-ins, the bulk of the tax cuts will not arrive until years 2007, 2008, and 2009. \\n   Can anyone seriously suggest that, in a $9 trillion economy, a $4 billion net tax cut for fiscal year 2000 will overstimulate consumer demand? Or even a $25 billion tax cut in 2001? Would a $39 billion tax cut in 2002 overheat the economy, when this is only .004 percent of projected GDP?  \\n   Clearly, the facts do not support the argument that our tax cuts will overheat the economy. In any event, from the demand-side perspective, the tax cut would be irrelevant. If we do not cut taxes by $792 billion, it is safe to say that spending will increase by $792 billion over the next decade--spending by the government, that is. That is what President Clinton means when he says we cannot afford a tax cut--his bureaucrats are working overtime to dream up new ways to spend the money, as if the government has first claims to the fruits of our citizens' labor. \\n   What kind of spending initiatives can we expect? A few years back, as many of us recall, President Clinton's so-called stimulus package included spending on such urgent needs as building parking garages at the beach, resurfacing tennis courts, researching the sicklefin chub fish, renovating swimming pools, building golf courses, soccer fields, and softball diamonds, and constructing an ice skating warming hut. \\n   Now, the President is not the only source of such wasteful spending ideas--we in Congress are very susceptible to pressures to spend, spend, spend. But no one here doubts for a minute that if the $792 billion in taxes are instead brought to Washington, the money will all be spent. That is one very good reason why we must keep the money out of Washington in the first place. \\n   The argument is also raised that a $792 billion tax cut leaves no money to meet some other important government goals such as debt reduction. But we still have $1.9 trillion in social security surpluses that will be in a ``lock-box'' to retire debt and shore up our citizens' retirement security, and another $505 billion in non-social security surpluses that can be used for Medicare, National Defense, and our other priorities. It is my hope that these surpluses will be used for real priorities, not the ice skating warming huts and beach parking garages. It should be clear that this half-trillion dollars is more than enough to cover our priorities. \\n   The rest of the arguments against our tax relief goal are similarly mistaken. Some people argue that the money is needed to retire publicly-held debt--although, after the tax cut, the remaining 75% of the surplus is available for debt reduction. Even with our tax cut, publicly-held national debt will be reduced from 40% of GDP to just 12% of GDP by 2009. \\n   Other people argue that the Federal Reserve Board would react to the tax cut by tightening the money supply. I have already noted that the very small size of the tax cuts over the next two years--just .0015% of GDP--does not add up to a dramatic increase in consumer demand and, in fact, will not increase demand since government spending would have increased by that same amount were we to collect the taxes. And I will point out that, on many occasion, including today, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has stated that he believes that government spending is the worst possible use of the surpluses, and that he would support tax cuts if spending is the alternative. Furthermore, a tax cut that removes government barriers to savings and investment is not an ``artificial stimulus'' that should worry the Fed one bit. Inflation, after all, is caused by too many dollars chasing too few goods, not by too many investors creating wealth and opportunity. An even stronger economy, fueled by the freedom and enthusiasm of our entrepreneurs, is not something to fear. \\n   It is even argued that a sizable tax cut passed now makes a future economic downturn more hazardous, as if the tax cuts needed for an economic rebound will have already been wasted by our efforts this year. Of course, that argument makes the case for tax cuts, as any tax cuts that would succeed in getting us out of a recession should keep us out of one in the first place. That is why former Fed Governor Lawrence Lindsey considers a tax cut a good insurance policy against an economic downturn. \\n   When you consider all of the arguments, there really is no case against cutting taxes by at least $792 billion. Chairman ROTH is to be commended for sticking to his guns and reporting out of Committee a bill that cuts taxes by that full amount, despite all of the pressure exerted by all of the advocates of big government, who would rather spend the money. \\n   One final point I want to make is that these abstract discussions tend to obscure the real reason we are here. Tax cuts are not about numbers, they aren't about aggregate statistics, they aren't about increasing demand by 4 thousandths of a percentage point--tax cuts are about people. We are cutting taxes because of the 67-year-old owner of a family business in Florida's panhandle, who is discouraged from reinvesting his hard-earned profits because the specter of the federal death tax is hovering, waiting to swoop down and scoop up 55% of the increased value of his business. We are cutting taxes because of the two-earner family, struggling to make ends meet, that has to pay over $1,000 extra in taxes just because they are married. \\n   We are cutting taxes so that waitresses, truck drivers, teachers and carpenters can put an extra $1,000 in their IRAs each year, to build a better nest egg for retirement. We are cutting taxes to enable a biomedical company to budget that one additional research project that just might lead to a breakthrough in the treatment of glaucoma or a cure for cancer. And we are cutting taxes to reduce government barriers to saving and investment, so the capital is available for the American entrepreneurs of the 21st Century to develop markets in technologies we cannot even imagine today. We need to cut taxes to get government out of the way and give people the freedom to pursue their own dream--not Washington's. \\n   I thank the Chair. \\n   I yield whatever time I did not use. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990722\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, on this occasion of the almost annual debate on NED, the National Endowment for Democracy, we can and we must declare our commitment to promoting freedom in the world. \\n   Freedom often exacts a price--it indeed is not free. Ronald Reagan understood this when he created NED, as have successive Presidents and Congresses who have consistently funded NED. \\n   Freedom is sacred. It is to be honored, protected, and shared with the world. It is the core of all human progress, and therefore, the spread of freedom enriches us all. \\n   But let us not forget, the price of freedom can be great. Just as we focus in this body these days on our abundance we must not forget those who have come before us; we must not forget in whose shoes we are walking. How many Americans have died; have put their lives on the line in the glorious pursuit of that sweetest of goals--emancipation from oppression and tyranny. We are the direct benefactors of the dedication, selflessness, and even the spilled blood, of countless people.  \\n   Should we be proud of those achievements? Of course, but we must also accept the weight--the responsibility--of this gift. The awesome responsibility which we have inherited. Because, when I said that freedom is not free, I was not only speaking of the cost to those currently suffering in the world to throw off the yoke of tyranny, but also the price to us, the benefactors of past actions. \\n   We are once again on the floor of the Senate to defend the National Endowment for Democracy. The last time we fought this battle, 2 years ago, 72 Senators voted to restore the funding to NED after the subcommittee zeroed the account. We are here today facing the same circumstances. The good news with the regularity of this debate, if we look for the bright side, is that we know very well of the strong support in the Senate for NED. And let me explain why. \\n   The history is important. In 1983, Ronald Reagan outlined an initiative for the United States to publicly lead the struggle for freedom around the world. A policy which I remember well as a young House Member and in many ways continues to influence my thinking about American foreign policy. A fundamental pillar of that policy was the National Endowment for Democracy. \\n   Let me read to you from a letter by President Reagan, from July 4, 1993.  \\n   On this 217th anniversary of our nation's independence, I am reminded that America's greatness lies not only in our success at home, but in the example of leadership that we provide the entire world. \\n   Our work, however, is not complete. As I look abroad, I see that the struggle between freedom and tyranny continues to be wages. Disappointly, in some places, it is autocracy, not freedom, that is winning the day. That is why I strongly support continued Congressional funding for the National Endowment for Democracy (NED). Ten years ago, at Westminster, you will recall that I outlined a new, bold initiative for our country to publicly lead the struggle for freedom abroad. As past of this effort, at my request, the National Endowment for Democracy was created.  \\n   Mr. President, let me point out a few fundamental things. First, NED is not a ``cold war relic,'' as some critics argue. You will note that President Reagan did not say that the purpose was to defeat communism, to defeat the Soviet Union, or to contain any particular ideology. He said that the mission of NED was to support America's efforts to ``lead the struggle for freedom.'' You should also note that the letter from which I read is dated July 4, 1993--2 years after the fall of the Soviet Union. So let me be clear: NED is not about the cold war and has never been exclusively about fighting communism or the Soviet Union. The National Endowment for Democracy is about freedom. \\n   My second point is that the need for NED is as great today as it has ever been. \\n   We opposed communism because the flawed ideology oppresses people and empowers tyrants. Communism has almost disappeared as a threat today; but tyranny has not--oppression has not. Indeed, tyranny and oppression continue to rule in far too many places around the globe. If you accept that we were right in the past to oppose freedom's foes, then we have the same task today, perhaps even more complicated than in the past. \\n   This vote, therefore, comes down to a simple issue: does the struggle for freedom continue in the world and does the United States continue to have a role in the struggle for freedom abroad? Does tyranny still reign in far too many places on earth? The answer is quite obviously, ``yes.'' \\n   Let me address some critical questions others have raised. \\n   Does NED work? NED works extremely well by providing resources to the freedom-activists throughout the world. NED identifies people struggling for economic, political, labor, press, and other reforms and gets them the resources necessary to fight against local oppression. \\n   His Holiness the Dalai Lama of Tibet says the following about NED:  \\n   The National Endowment for Democracy furthers the goals of your great nation and has provided moral and substantive support for oppressed peoples everywhere. Its unique independent mission has brought information and hope to people committed to peace and freedom, including the Tibetans. I sincerely hope that this institution will continue to receive support, because America's real strength comes not from its status as a `superpower' but from the ideals and principles on which it was founded.  \\n   So the final question which someone may rightly put to this debate: why not the State Department? Isn't NED redundant? \\n   To answer this question, I defer to some experts who understand the executive branch and State Department well. I turn to a bipartisan group of former Secretaries of State and National Security Advisors. \\n   In a 1995 letter, former National Security Advisors Allen, Carlucci, Brzezinski, and Scowcroft state that NED:  \\n   ..... operates in situations where direct government involvement is not appropriate. It is an exceptionally effective instrument in today's climate for reaching dedicated groups seeking to counter extreme nationalist and autocratic forces that are responsible for so much conflict and instability.  \\n   Let me emphasize that these National Security Advisors state that NED is operating where the U.S. government cannot. \\n   I also have a letter from former Secretaries of State, including Secretaries Baker, Muskie, Eagleburger, Shultz, Haig, Vance, and Kissinger. This distinguished group states the following:  \\n   During this period of international change and uncertainty, the work of NED continues to be an important bipartisan but non-governmental contributor to democratic reform and freedom. We consider the non-governmental character of the NED even more relevant today than it was at NED's founding.  \\n   Let me review the main arguments. First, NED's necessity did not end with the cold war, but remains an integral part of America's opposition to the enemies of freedom. Second, the world continues to need America's invaluable work in promoting freedom--perhaps even now more than ever. And finally, NED makes a unique contribution to America's initiative to ``lead the struggle for freedom abroad.'' \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990722\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to engage the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee in a colloquy. First let me begin by thanking my friends for ensuring the committee report included $2 million under the National Ocean Service account to support scientific research and coral reef studies. It is my understanding this money is to be divided equally between the National Coral Reef Institute in Ft. Lauderdale, FL, and the University of Hawaii. This research is critical to our understanding of the factors at work in the degradation of reef ecosystems around the world and I appreciate all my colleagues did in Committee to support this effort. \\n   I say to my colleagues, it is my understanding the Chairman's amendment contains additional funding for this account. Is it correct to say these funds are in addition to the $2 million currently provided by the Committee to the National Coral Reef Institute and the University of Hawaii? \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-19990722\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I thank my colleagues for this clarification and for their support of coral reef research. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-3-19990722\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee if he would consent to discuss with me for a moment two issues of concern to me with respect to NOAA activities in Florida. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-4-19990722\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. First, let me say I appreciate my friend from New Hampshire's hard work for the strong support he's given to the State of Florida in the bill before us today. But I would like to bring to the Chairman's attention an initiative undertaken by Florida's top three research universities: the University of Florida, Florida State University and the University of Miami. These three institutions came together to ensure their extensive capabilities in the areas of marine, atmosphere and climate prediction research were focused on the needs of the entire Southeast region. They have especially come together to study the El Nino phenomenon. Their effort has been recognized by NOAA and they have become one of the agency's first regional assessment centers. \\n   My concern, Mr. President, is about the possibility that NOAA may reduce resources available to Florida and this valuable research initiative. Clearly, Florida and the Southeast region are significantly impacted by climatic developments. A strong and continued investment in Florida and the region--along with a balanced investment in the regional assessment centers--is essential. I would ask the support of the Committee to continue the base level funding of this important collaborative  effort. The institutions had been receiving approximately $500,000 per year through the Office of Global Programs, and I would like the Chairman's assurances that this level of funding should and will be continued during the next fiscal year. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-5-19990722\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Yes. I know the chairman is aware of the Florida Congressional delegation's strong commitment to the restoration of the Everglades and Florida Bay. I have heard some concern, however, that internal reallocations within NOAA could result in at least a $1 million reduction in South Florida based Florida Bay activities. The administration asked for significant funding of the Everglades-Florida Bay initiative in both FY 99 and FY 2000 through the Coastal Ocean Science Program. But the concern I'm hearing from Florida indicates that NOAA may reallocate funds away from this initiative and toward other programs and purposes. I would like the Chairman to join me in stressing to the agency that funds in this bill currently allocated for critical Florida Bay initiatives not be depleted. I would like the Chairman to join me in working to ensure the NOAA contribution to the interagency program for Florida and adjacent coastal marine waters is continued at the current levels. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-6-19990722\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I appreciate my friend's comments with respect to these two issues. I thank him again for his continued support of Florida priorities. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-7-19990722\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I would like to engage the Chairman of the subcommittee in a brief colloquy regarding Barry University in Miami Shores, Florida. Barry University has a strong history of addressing important Miami community issues like urbanization, ethnic diversity, community development and cultural understanding. Recently the University announced the planning of an Intercultural Community Center which is designed to promote necessary neighborhood and small business revitalization. The facility will provide conference space, meeting rooms, executive seminars and continuing education courses related to international business and commerce. \\n   It is my understanding Barry University will be requesting an Economic Development Administration grant for this project from the Department of Commerce during the next fiscal year. I would appreciate the Chairman's support in recommending the Department of Commerce give strong consideration  to the merits of University's grant application. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-8-19990722\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I appreciate my friend from New Hampshire's comments on this important initiative and for all he and the Senator from South Carolina have done in this bill for the citizens of Florida. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990722\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President today I am pleased to join my colleague, Mr. BREAUX, in sponsoring The Medicare Home Health Beneficiary Equity and Payment Simplification Act of 1999. \\n   This legislation sets forth a fully developed prospective payment system for Medicare home health benefits that can be implemented easily using currently available data and can be accurately monitored to prevent fraud and abuse. Most importantly, the bill restores access to covered services for the sickest, most frail Medicare beneficiaries while providing incentives for efficient treatment of all patients regardless of the acuity of their medical condition. \\n   The bill provides for a simple four-category prospective payment system for home health services (similar to the four-category system which has been in place for hospice services since 1983) which is based on data from a 1997 study conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation on characteristics of Medicare patients in need of covered home health services. The Kaiser Foundation study found that Medicare patients in need of home health services historically have fallen into one of the following categories: \\n   1. Post-hospital, short stay beneficiaries \\n   2. Medically stable, long-stay beneficiaries \\n   3. Medically complex, long-stay beneficiaries \\n   4. Medically unstable and complex, extremely high use beneficiaries \\n   Beneficiaries who meet all eligibility and coverage requirements for Medicare will be assigned to the appropriate category by a physician who does not have a prohibited relationship with the home health agency as defined in the ``Stark II'' law. Beneficiaries who do not clearly fit in one of the four categories will be placed in the first, lowest rate category. \\n   Payment rates for each of the categories is the average cost of treating patients in that category in 1994 as determined by the Kaiser Foundation study. Those rates are adjusted for wage variations in different parts of the country and updated by the home health market basket for each fiscal year. The Secretary of HHS is given the authority to provide additional payments to certain agencies that have higher costs due to reasons beyond their control. \\n   The bill would eliminate the 15% cut in Medicare home health reimbursement which is scheduled to go into effect on October 1, 2000. The bill would also simplify the reimbursement system by making payments based on the location of the agency rather than the residence of the patient. The bill is inten ded to provide a ``fail safe'' prospective payment mechanism in the event that HCFA falls behind in its schedule to implement a prospective payment system by October 1, 2000 that can be administered efficiently and monitored effectively. \\n   I urge my colleagues to join us in co-sponsoring this important piece of legislation. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990720\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise to speak for just a moment to express my profound sympathy and condolences to our colleague and friend, Senator TED KENNEDY, and the members of the Kennedy family, and for the Bessette family, as well. \\n   Although I know the pain of losing a loved one, I have little conception of the pain which Senator KENNEDY and his family are feeling with the multiple losses of family members at such early stages in their lives, and under such tragic conditions. \\n   My heart is heavy with grief for the family, and my thoughts and prayers are with them. I can only pray that they realize and are comforted in some small manner by the love, affection, and support of the Members of this body, as well as people all across this nation, for whom the Kennedy family is a symbol of courage, achievement, and service to mankind. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990715\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Dr. Larry Kerr, a health fellow for the Judiciary Committee, be granted the privilege of the floor for the remainder of the debate on the Patients' Bill of Rights. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-19990715\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I thank the Chair. \\n   Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senator FRIST, Senator JEFFORDS, and Senator COLLINS, and others, as we offer this amendment to provide cancer patients with coverage of health insurance benefits when they participate in approved clinical trials. \\n   Many health plans will not pay for the cost of routine patient care if patients want to participate in a clinical trial. As a result, beneficiaries with cancer are denied access to these trials of promising new therapies because these therapies are deemed ``experimental'' by most health plans and, therefore, not qualified for coverage. This means many cancer patients have two choices when they have exhausted all traditional therapies: either pay the cost of participating in a clinical trial themselves or go without additional treatment. \\n   For all but the most wealthy patients, it is cost prohibitive to take part in a clinical trial. This amendment will help ensure that a patient's decision about whether or not to participate in a clinical trial is based upon science and not cost. \\n   Clinical trials are one of the most effective ways of determining which treatments are beneficial. Yet cancer researchers have told me they have had difficulty enrolling the required number of patients to participate in the clinical trials they are conducting. Scientists have identified noncoverage by private insurers, as well as Medicare, as one of the primary reasons why patients do not participate in clinical trials. \\n   For example, approximately 2 percent of cancer patients are participating in clinical trials. This amendment will help scientists recruit cancer patients who wish to participate in clinical trials by breaking down the financial barriers which may preclude most patients from participating. \\n   Clinical trials are one of the most effective techniques for assessing the effectiveness of a scientific and medical intervention. Many of my Senate colleagues have joined with me in a bipartisan effort to double biomedical research funding through the National Institutes of Health. Last year, Congress appropriated $15.6 billion for NIH. This represented a $2 billion increase, the largest increase in NIH history. At a time when American researchers are making such tremendous progress in scientific areas such as cancer genetics and biology, it is essential that this knowledge be translated into new therapies through well-designed clinical trials. This amendment is a natural extension of the historic effort to double funding for medical research in our country. \\n   When my brother, Michael, was diagnosed with cancer, there were only three basic forms of treatment--surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Today, scientists are revolutionizing the treatment of cancer by developing many new weapons to kill cancer, including gene therapy and immunotherapy. \\n   On a personal note again, every time I get into these discussions, and every time I see the new efforts that are being pursued, and the successes that have been developed, I cannot help but think if Michael's melanoma had been discovered or if he had found the disease much later in his life, when these new procedures--gene therapy and immunotherapy were available--and if he had been able to participate in a clinical trial, which he attempted to do throughout his treatment many years ago, his life may have been saved. \\n   This amendment will help scientists continue the unprecedented progress being made to find new methods of treatment. \\n   Coverage of cancer clinical trials is a bipartisan issue. Earlier this year, for example, Senator ROCKEFELLER and I introduced legislation to provide for Medicare coverage of cancer clinical trials. I am pleased to say that 36 additional Senators, from both sides of the aisle, have cosponsored this legislation. I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this important legislation during the 106th Congress. \\n   The reason Senator ROCKEFELLER and I targeted our legislation to cancer is the same reason we have targeted this amendment to cancer today--there is a legitimate debate about what the true cost may be. Senator ROCKEFELLER and I believe the cost will be insignificant. And we have the studies to prove that. \\n   However, there are legitimate concerns with respect to cost which have been raised. Both the amendment we offer today and the Rockefeller-Mack legislation, call for a study and report to Congress in 2005 on the cost implications of covering cancer clinical trials. \\n   I support comprehensive coverage of clinical trials. But, at this time, we need more information before we go further. This amendment will help provide the information we need to make a better informed decision. \\n   During markup of S. 326, the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions considered an amendment offered by my friend and colleague, Senator DODD, to provide clinical trial coverage. \\n   Since then, my colleagues and I have more thoroughly studied this amendment. We have examined what barriers exist that impede enrollment in clinical trials. We looked into the cost implications. We considered the best way to define the term ``routine patient costs.'' \\n   Let me first highlight the many similarities in our amendment and the amendment which Senator DODD offered during committee consideration. \\n   Our amendment requires plans to provide coverage of routine patient costs. I will get back to that term in a few minutes. \\n   Our amendments ensures that health plans are not required to pay for costs of items and services that are reasonably expected to be paid for by the sponsors of a clinical trial. This includes tests or measurements conducted primarily for the purpose of a clinical trial. \\n   Our amendment permits plans to require clinical trial participants to use in-network providers, if they are available. If coverage is provided by a nonparticipating provider, payment would be at the same rate the plan would pay for comparable services to a participating provider. \\n   Our amendment is limited to those health plans over which Congress has sole and exclusive jurisdiction. \\n   Our amendment is limited to only the highest-quality clinical trials. These include trials approved and funded by the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Veterans Affairs,  and the Department of Defense. Only those trials which have undergone the rigors of peer-review will be considered. \\n   Our legislation differs with Senator DODD's proposal in three ways. \\n   The first difference is how to best define the term ``routine patient cost.'' In researching this issue, we have found that there is not a generally accepted definition of the term, ``routine patient cost'' associated with participation in a clinical trial. The Balanced Budget Act required the Institute of Medicine to conduct a study on the issue of cancer clinical trial coverage, including the definition of routine patient costs. This study is due in September, and it will likely help us to better define this highly technical term. There are other experts who have opinions on how to define the term ``routine patient cost.'' We believe it is best to leave this task to patients, employers, health plans and those with true expertise in the field of clinical trials. \\n   It is essential to remember that protocols for clinical trials vary widely, and routine patient costs for clinical trials also vary. Scientific researchers have indicated that developing one standard for determining routine patient costs will be a daunting task. I don't believe Congress is best qualified to make this important scientific determination. \\n   Therefore, our amendment provides for a negotiated rulemaking process to establish a time-limited committee charged with developing standards relating to the coverage of routine patient costs for patients participating in clinical trials. This way, organizations representing cancer patients, health care practitioners, hospitals, employers, manufacturers of drugs and medical devices, medical economists and others will be involved in the process of defining routine patient costs with respect to clinical trials. \\n   By May, this committee is required to develop standards for routine patient costs for individuals who are participating in those trials. If the committee is unable to reach a consensus, then the Secretary must develop these standards and publish a rule by June 30, in the year 2000. In either case, coverage for these benefits would begin for plans beginning on, or after, January 1, 2001. \\n   We believe that a negotiated rulemaking process is the best way for organizations representing all who are affected to collectively determine what costs should be considered in ``routine patient costs.'' These decisions will have a major effect of the cost of covering clinical trials. \\n   I will just underscore that again. These decisions will have a major effect on the cost of covering clinical trials. \\n   Under the Democratic bill, these organizations can only submit a comment to the Secretary, who has broad authority to determine what constitutes routine patient costs. However, those comments could be rejected out-of-hand by the Secretary. \\n   By contrast, the negotiated rulemaking process ensures that all who have an interest in the outcome have a seat at the negotiating table to make the decision. We believe it is essential that cancer patients have an opportunity to be involved in establishing standards for routine patient costs, and a negotiated rulemaking procedure affords them that opportunity. \\n   Second, as I mentioned earlier, our amendment differs from the Dodd amendment in that it is limited to cancer clinical trials. There are more clinical trials involving cancer than perhaps any other disease. This targeted approach will not only provide a needed benefit to a large patient population, but it will also provide significant information for the study and report called for in this amendment. \\n   Finally, our amendment includes a study and report to Congress on the costs to health plans and any impact on health insurance premiums. Senator DODD's amendment did not include this study and report, which I believe is extremely important. Congress can then use this important information to determine if they wish to expand coverage for patients with other diseases. \\n   Like most of my colleagues, I am very concerned about the ever-increasing costs of health insurance. According to the Congressional Budget Office, our amendment will result in an increase in health insurance premiums of less than one-tenth of one percent. The Dodd proposal would cost five times that amount. \\n   I have met with thousands of cancer patients throughout Florida and the rest of the United States, patients desperately wanting to participate in clinical trials when traditional therapies are no longer beneficial. \\n   Let me conclude my comments here today by relating an experience which puts a human face on why this issue is so important. \\n   As my colleagues may know, I frequently visit the National Institutes of Health to meet with scientific reserchers so I may gain a better understanding of the many advances which are taking place to detect and treat cancer and other diseases. \\n   Over the years, I have been fortunate to get to know Dr. Steven Rosenberg, a world-renowned scientist and oncologist who is an expert in the field of melanoma research and treatment. I first met Dr. Rosenberg after reading his book, ``The Transformed Cell.'' \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-3-19990715\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I ask for 2 additional minutes. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-4-19990715\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Last year, I was meeting with Dr. Rosenberg to learn about a clinical trial he is conducting on a state-of-the art melanoma vaccine. During our conversation, Dr. Rosenberg mentioned that one of my constituents was at NCI participating in that clinical trial. I asked if I might meet him. Before we went to his hospital room at NCI, Dr. Rosenberg showed me photographs which had previously been taken. This patient had purple, bulbous melanoma lesions several inches in diameter down the side of his body. \\n   Dr. Rosenberg introduced me to my constituent, and we engaged in casual conversation. \\n   At one point I asked him how he was doing. To show me how he was doing, this brave man took off his hospital gown and showed me that these lesions of huge size on both his arm and his side were totally gone. That is why I think it is so important that we have this amendment included in the legislation, so that other cancer patients will have the same opportunity. \\n   To conclude, what is this amendment really about? Most importantly, it is about giving patients fighting cancer the hope that an experimental therapy being tested in a well-designed clinical trial might save their lives. In addition to providing hope, it paves the way for new therapies that will, one day, not only provide hope, but a cure. It is about allowing cancer patients to make what may be the final major health care decision of their lives--whether to participate in a clinical trial. \\n   Mr. President, I've met with many patients who were participating in clinical trials. To me, these patients are, in many ways, like America's astronauts. Later this month, we will celebrate the 30th anniversary of man's landing on the Moon. Like the astronauts of Apollo, clinical trial participants are pioneers. They are heroes, who are helping to push science and medicine into new frontiers. We must provide hope to these brave Americans. \\n   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-5-19990715\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I am not sure I need 5 minutes. I could not help but listen very closely to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle with respect to the issue of clinical trials and the idea of targeting clinical trials to cancer. \\n   One could draw the conclusion from what they had to say either they never heard of the idea of targeting clinical trials to cancer or there was some confusion. I remind my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who have supported a clinical trial expansion of the Medicare program that is limited to only cancer --let me say that again. The clinical trial legislation that Senator ROCKEFELLER and I introduced earlier this year is limited to cancer only; just as this amendment is limited to cancer: Senator FEINSTEIN, Senator SARBANES, Senator JOHNSON, Senator  BINGAMAN, Senator KERRY, Senator LEAHY, Senator KERREY, Senator SCHUMER, Senator AKAKA, Senator MURRAY, Senator BREAUX, Senator MIKULSKI, Senator CONRAD, Senator WELLSTONE, Senator MOYNIHAN, Senator INOUYE, Senator GRAHAM, Senator HARKIN, Senator KENNEDY, Senator BOXER, Senator DURBIN, Senator ROBB, Senator BIDEN, Senator DODD, and Senator HOLLINGS. \\n   I submit that one of the reasons we have this not only in this amendment but also in the Medicare approach is because there is truly a concern about what the true cost of clinical trials is. As I said in my earlier comment, Senator ROCKEFELLER and I happen to believe the cost is quite small. In fact, there are arguments out there that Medicare is already picking up the cost of those clinical trials. We have limited it to cancer because we, in fact, believe we can develop information that will allow us to expand it. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-6-19990715\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. If the Senator would wait. What I have found, as I have listened to this debate now for 4 days, is the term ``compartmentalization'' comes back into my mind: The ability on the other side of the aisle to think of one procedure, one amendment, one concept at a time, as if it has no influence or no effect on the cost of health care and what it might do to those individuals who could lose their health care coverage because of increased costs. It is very reasonable to ask the question: What does it cost; how do you define certain aspects of the clinical trial that is going to take place? \\n   I will be glad to yield. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-7-19990715\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Can I inquire who is going to use that minute? \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-8-19990715\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I believe the Senator from Florida has been graciously given 1 minute by Senator KENNEDY. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-9-19990715\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. First of all, the impression created that HMOs or most HMOs cover all clinical trials is inaccurate. \\n   There is a second component to this thing. ERISA plans versus the plans that we have control over may be confusing the issue as well. \\n   In addition, though, I think it is important to focus. Again, this discussion has come down to a discussion about cost. I happen to agree with the Senator from Connecticut about the data that we have from those two health organizations. But I think he knows as  well that there are those out there who make claims that the cost of the clinical trials would be substantially higher than that--from OMB, CBO, the administration. \\n   So the point is that there is a legitimate debate about the cost of clinical trials. I am saying I think, before we go to the full extent of comprehensive coverage, we ought to fully understand what we are getting ourselves involved in. \\n   With that, I yield the floor. \\n   Mr. DODD addressed the Chair. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990714\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank Senator FRIST for yielding me time. I also appreciate greatly the comments made with respect to the clinical trials. Again, I look forward to continuing to work with him in the future on this issue. \\n   Mr. President, I want to respond to one provision of the amendment offered last night by my friend from Connecticut, Senator DODD. This provision goes to a concern that has been raised by patients throughout our country--the issue of health coverage for patients who are participating in clinical trials. \\n   As Members of the United States Senate, we must seek legislative solutions to a wide array of public policy issues. These issues include health policy, as we are doing today. They include tax policy, economic policy, foreign policy, and education policy. The list is quite expansive. Frequently, we find ourselves divided on issues of the day. \\n   However, I can think of no issue which better unites Republicans and Democrats, conservatives and liberals, as the issue of biomedical research. \\n   In addition to Senator DODD, we are fortunate to have many, many leaders in the Senate on this important issue. Senator SPECTER and Senator HARKIN are leading the historic bipartisan effort to double funding for the National Institutes of Health. Senator JEFFORDS, Senator FIRST, Senator KENNEDY, and Senator MIKULSKI have worked hard in their committee to authorize and oversee the activities of the HIH. Any many more of my colleagues have each contributed in their own way to help make funding for HIH the national priority it is today. As I said, few issues unite the Senate like medical research. \\n   One of the highlights during my 17 years as a Member of the Senate and House of Representatives has been to meet the scientists who are revolutionizing the way man fights disease, and to improve our quality of life. It doesn't matter if they are a young bench scientist or a Nobel Laureate, their mission remains the same--to find ways to detect and treat diseases. Today, there is a level of commitment and enthusiasm to this monumental endeavor that I've never seen before. Today, researchers dare to use the word, ``cure.'' That wasn't the case very long ago. \\n   As we work to make sure that scientists have the necessary resources to continue their remarkable progress, we must also address the ethical, legal and social implications of biomedical research. Science is moving faster than public policy can keep pace. It's as though science is on the Concorde, and Congress stalled at Kitty Hawk trying to get off the ground. \\n   There are very difficult, complex scientific issues which require Congressional action, but these issues also require thoughtful and careful deliberation. For example, Congress has been working for many years to ensure that health plans do not discriminate against people because of their genetic information. As a cancer survivor, I know how important it is to have confidence in knowing that a genetic test will be used for information, not discrimination. I've been part of a bipartisan effort to resolve this issue, starting with legislation introduced by our former colleague, Senator Mark Hatfield. \\n   Genetic nondiscrimination is a very complex issue with wide-ranging ramifications. There have been many questions to answer. Congress has struggled with how best to define medical and scientific terms. We have examined the impact of our actions on the cost and availability of health insurance. Frequently, we have determined that much more information was needed before deciding the best approach. \\n   We have addressed the issue of genetic nondiscrimination with thoughtful deliberation, and I believe the Congress must take the same thoughtful, deliberative approach when it comes to coverage of clinical trials. \\n   There are many questions to be answered. What are the cost implications? How will this new benefit impact the availability of health insurance? What impact will coverage of clinical trials have on health insurance premiums? How will it impact small business owners, who are struggling to provide health insurance for their employees? What is the best approach to defining medical and scientific terms, such as ``routine patient costs''?--becasue that definition will determine what the underlying costs of this effort will be. \\n   These are very important questions, involving very complex issues, with very significant implications. \\n   Mr. President, I support comprehensive coverage of clinical trials. But, as this time, we need more information before we go that far. \\n   Later today, or tomorrow, I will be introducing an amendment, along with Senator FRIST, Senator JEFFORDS, Senator COLLINS, and others, which will help provide patients, scientists, lawmakers, employers, health plans and others with answers to the many questions associated with health insurance coverage for clinical trials. I will outline our approach at that time. \\n   Mr. President, medical research is a bipartisan issue. We all agree that the basic scientific research funded by the National Institutes of Health must be translated into new forms of treatment through well-designed clinical trials. Earlier this year, Senator ROCKFELLER and I introduced legislation to provide Medicare coverage for cancer clinical trials. I am pleased to say that a bipartisan group of 36 Senators have cosponsored this bill. Senator SNOWE and others have introduced legislation to provide coverage through private health plans. We may approach the issue in different ways, but we all agree that the Senate must address the issue of clinical trial coverage, and we must do so now.  \\n   Mr. President, I look forward to discussing my amendment later in the debate. \\n   I yield the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990630\\n\\n    Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I oppose this travel amendment in the strongest possible terms. This is the wrong language at the wrong time. It represents a fundamental change in our Cuba policy--a change without proper consideration. \\n   The Foreign Relations Committee has not considered this language; in fact, nobody has seen this language until it was introduced this afternoon. We should not rush this language through. \\n   We should not do this. This is a half-baked approach, which makes for weak policy; it is not a mature effort to craft serious policy. \\n   Fidel responds to our positive gestures with arrests, oppression, and crackdown. This effort is misguided and must be tabled. \\n   Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990622\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able to address the Senate as if in morning business for up to 15 minutes. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-19990622\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I thank the Chair. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990622\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, proponents of the quota legislation to be considered later today have spoken with vigor and passion regarding the ``injury'' that was suffered by domestic steel companies and the threat imports pose to the workers at those companies.  \\n   However, I am compelled to rise today to respond to many of the assertions raised regarding the steel industry specifically, and more generally I think it is important to speak to several other factors related to the bill. First, there are economic benefits all Americans enjoy as a result of lowering trade barriers; second, the harmful message a quota bill would send to our trading partners; and, third, the inappropriateness of Congress singling out a specific industry for special treatment. \\n   The first point I would like to make is that the import surge is over. According to the Department of Commerce, imports have returned to their traditional levels. In fact, overall steel imports in the first 4 months of 1999 were below the ``pre-import'' surge level. Moreover, even with the import surge of 1998, U.S. steel producers reported profits of over $1 billion. \\n   Furthermore, in reviewing data provided by the Steel Manufacturers Association, I was surprised to find that U.S. steel production has increased over the last 10 years. The 1998 steel output of 107.6 million tons was 10 percent greater than 1990 and the highest for any year since 1981. \\n   Additionally, I was interested to discover that since 1987, imports as a percentage of domestic consumption have remained constant at around 20 percent. Again, according to this data, no ground has been lost despite protestations to the contrary. \\n   Some have argued that the financial ill health of several specific companies such as Bethlehem Steel Corporation, Weirton Steel Corporation, Laclede Steel Company, Acme Metals Incorporated, and Geneva Steel Company are the direct result of last year's import surge. However, the fact is that many of the integrated steel mills have a history of declining financial health evident well in advance of the Asian crisis and the 1998 import surge. This is reflected in their stock performance which, without exception, shows a pronounced decline in the value of the stock over the last 5 years. Again, it has nothing to do with the surge in imports. \\n   Noting the declining employment figures in the steel industry, proponents of the quota bill suggest that the United States is losing market share, but the fact is imports have not led to a decrease in market share. U.S. steel production in traditional integrated mills has remained fairly flat. Import competition has merely forced U.S. steel to become more efficient. The growth in domestic production that has allowed U.S. steel to retain its domestic share has been almost exclusively a result of our Nation's mini-mills which now account for almost 50 percent of domestic steel production. Mini-mills use an innovative production technique to recycle scrapped steel. These highly efficient and environmentally friendly producers are transforming the steel industry, and I think here it is worth noting that the association of mini-mills is neutral with regard to the proposed quota legislation. \\n   Finally in this area, some argue our foreign competitors are playing by a different set of rules. \\n   This is exactly what our current antidumping laws are intended to address. The steel industry has shown itself to be intimately familiar with and more than willing to take advantage of these laws. Even though steel accounts for only 5 percent of our imports, the industry has generated 46 percent of the unfair-trade complaints brought before the U.S. International Trade Commission during the last 2 decades. Our current laws provide appropriate protection for all industries. They should not be circumvented in order to provide extraordinary protection for a single industry. \\n   All too often we hear complaints of lost jobs and invariably the blame is laid on trade. This allegation has gone unanswered for far too long. Trade has given us far more jobs than would otherwise be available. The fact is that the size of the trade sector has grown steadily during the last 50 years. As a share of the economy, trade doubled between 1950 and 1980, and it has doubled again between 1980 and 1998. Not surprisingly, employment has expanded from 99 million in 1980 to 133 million today. And, the unemployment rate has fallen to 4.2 percent, the lowest level in 30 years. \\n   Far from harming our economy, trade has been a major contributing factor to our growth and our prosperity. Real GDP is now 64 percent greater than it was in 1980 and we have experienced only 9 months of recession during the last 16 years. Moreover, our growth rate is now the highest and our unemployment rate the lowest among the G-7 nations. \\n   Trade makes it possible for us to focus on the production of the things we do best, and thereby produce a larger output and enjoy a higher standard of living. For goods and services that we produce cheaply, we can expand our output and sell abroad at attractive prices. And for things we do poorly, we can acquire them more economically from foreign producers. Thus, trade promotes prosperity. \\n   We have fought for open markets both through GATT and now the WTO. And we have been engaged in this fight, this battle for almost 50 years. For some time, we have told the world that economic freedom and a market economy are key ingredients of prosperity. The steel quota bill undermines this message. \\n   Let me make four points with respect to the message. \\n   A quota bill would send the wrong message to the European Union. A quota bill would send the wrong message to the former Communist countries seeking to establish market economies. A quota bill would send the wrong message to investors. And a quota bill would send the wrong message to our trading partners. \\n   Let me just touch lightly on each of those. \\n   With respect to the European Union, \\n   we are currently in the midst of a trade dispute with the EU regarding their restrictions on both bananas and beef. The steel quota bill undercuts our position on these issues. How can we complain about the restrictions of others while we ourselves are erecting trade barriers? \\n   With respect to the leaders of the former communist countries, this bill says when we think it is convenient, it is all right to substitute political manipulation for markets. I can assure you, the leaders of the former communist countries are watching. If a prosperous America with a low unemployment rate is willing to bail out troubled firms, how can we expect them to refrain from such action. \\n   With respect to investors, while much of the world has been in recession, investment flowed into the United States and the U.S. economy remained strong. In no small degree, this confidence of investors was due to the openness of our economy and our reliance on markets rather than politics. \\n   Again, with respect to our trading partners, our trading partners--most of which have lower and slower rates of growth and higher unemployment--are unlikely to stand idly by while we impose trade barriers. Retaliation and escalation of trade barriers are likely side-effects. \\n   Finally, it bears mentioning that it is a serious mistake for Congress to play favorites. This is precisely what is involved here. \\n   This bill imposes a tax on steel-users in order to subsidize steel-producers. A substantial share of the U.S. steel industry refines raw steel into finished and specialty goods. The U.S. steel industry is therefore a major purchaser of imported steel. Higher steel prices which will surely accompany import quotas will increase the cost of refined steel and make these products less competitive than would otherwise be the case. \\n   Moreover, this bill would treat the steel industry different than other industries. Steel is not the only industry that has been adversely affected by currency devaluations and weak demand due to the Asian crisis and recession in several parts of the world. The sales of many firms were affected as the result of these factors. Why should this industry be singled out for special treatment? \\n   In conclusion, I want to stress that the legislation we will be considering later today proposes that the Congress intervene in the market, risk a trade war, and endanger the future health of our economy in order to insulate a segment of out steel industry from competition. I maintain there is already sufficient legislation on the books to protect industries against unfair competitive practices. Quotas and trade barriers are the wrong path. The world has already gone down this ``trade  war'' road once before with the Smoot-Hawley Law of 1930. Let's not make that same mistake again. \\n   Additionally, I should note that Chairman Greenspan recently has sounded the dangers of protectionism. He now believes that rising protectionism is the single most dangerous threat to our future growth and prosperity. I share his concern. \\n   Make no mistake about it--important principles are at stake here. We should be reducing trade barriers rather than increasing them. We have no business playing favorites. As our recent High-Tech Summit indicated, trade in both goods and ideas has made an enormous contribution to our prosperity. We must not allow this misguided effort to assist some at the expense of others and endanger American prosperity. \\n   With that, I yield the floor, Mr. President. \\n   Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990616\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of the Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999. This bill was introduced by Senator JEFFORDS and co-sponsored by 77 members. The primary purpose of this legislation is to expand the availability of health care coverage under the Social Security Act for working individuals with disabilities. This bill establishes a Ticket to Work and Self-Sufficiency Program in the Social Security Administration to make available meaningful work opportunities for the disabled. \\n   Some months ago, in Florida, I met a woman who does not have the use of her arms. This woman is an accomplished artist who uses her feet to create beautiful works of art. She spoke with me about the difficulty she has had over the years obtaining health insurance for routine medical care and asked me to support this bill. It is with her in mind and the many other talented, hard-working disabled Americans that I support this act which will make it possible for them to obtain health coverage and lead productive working lives. \\n   This bill allows states to offer Medicaid coverage to workers with disabilities beyond what is currently available to them under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. It creates two new optional eligibility categories and allows states to offer buy-ins for the working disabled so that they can maintain health care coverage, work, and have as much independence as their disability allows. One option permits states to offer a Medicaid buy-in to people with disabilities who work and have an earned income above 250% of poverty with specified levels for assets, resources and unearned income set by the state in which they reside. This is important to many of the disabled who have income or assets that exceed the current level and have an earned income that has exceeded $500 per month during the past year. The state can and should impose a sliding scale of cost-sharing of the premium, up to 100% of the premium, based on the income of the individual. This will allow many of the disabled who simply cannot get health insurance because they have income or assets above a certain level, to obtain health coverage. With the passage of this legislation, a person with disabilities who may be an artist, computer programmer or run a telephone answering service can now be successful at work and have no fear of being unable to obtain health coverage. \\n   The second option allows states that elect to participate in the first option to also cover people who have a severe impairment but can lose eligibility for Supplemental Security Income or Social Security Disability Insurance because of medical improvement. In certain cases, the only reason a person improves is because they receive medical treatment. This bill prevents a person from losing their health care coverage when their health improves due to medical treatment. The state can allow this type of person to buy into the state Medicaid program at a premium set by the state. This is a blessing to persons with disabling conditions which are amenable to treatment such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, depression, or sickle cell anemia. It allows people who can work to work and receive treatment for what may be a chronic disease and have no fear of losing their health coverage. \\n   An additional benefit of this bill provides for the continuation of Medicare coverage for working individuals with disabilities. An extended period of eligibility will allow people who receive Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) to continue to receive Part A Medicare coverage without payment for up to six years after returning to work. At present, disabled people may receive Medicare coverage for nine months followed by 36 months of extended eligibility but after that, they have to pay the Part A premium in full. Often, people returning to work following a period of coverage by SSDI, work part time so they are ineligible for health insurance or they cannot obtain insurance through their employer or from the private market. This bill would permit them to receive Part A coverage and have coverage they could not otherwise obtain. \\n   I join with my colleagues in support of this legislation to help the disabled help themselves. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990616\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I want to engage the distinguished Senator from new Mexico and the distinguished Senator from Nevada, managers of the pending bill, in a colloquy. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-19990616\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I thank the Senator. \\n   Florida International University in my State of Florida has done a truly remarkable job of working with the Department of Energy in carrying out critically important environmental research and development of deactivation and decommissioning environmental technologies. More specifically, FIU's Hemispheric Center for Environmental Technology (HCET) has a proud history of partnering with DOE through its Environmental Management program to form a true `center of excellence' in these areas and the President's fiscal year 2000 budget request for the EM program assumes full funding for continuation of this impressive partnership. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-3-19990616\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I yield to my colleague from Florida. \\n   Senator GRAHAM. I echo the comments of the Senator from Florida about the FIU Hemispheric Center for Environmental Technology and reinforce the importance of the FIU Center in assisting the Department of Energy in deactivation and decommissioning of some of the most strategically important DOE sites in the Nation, including Fernald, Chicago, Albuquerque, Richland, and Oak Ridge facilities. I am proud of the role that HCET plays in these efforts. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-4-19990616\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I thank my colleague from Florida. It is my understanding that the President's budget contains sufficient funding ($5,000,000) to fully fund the current working agreement between Florida International University and the Department of Energy. Is that the Chairman's understanding? \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-5-19990616\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I thank the Chairman. I specifically request that, as the distinguished senior Senator from New Mexico and the chairman of the Energy and Water Development Subcommittee continues to shepherd this legislation through the Senate and conference with the House, he would make every possible effort to provide the full budget request for the DOE's Environmental Management program and protect the full funding contained therein for the DOE-Florida International University partnership. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-6-19990616\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I thank the distinguished Senators from New Mexico and Nevada for their commitment and leadership on this important legislation. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990616\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to remedy a problem in the way the U.S. taxes the foreign operations of U.S. electric and gas utilities. With the 1992 passage of the National Energy Policy Act, Congress gave a green light to U.S. utilities wishing to do business abroad, lifting a long-standing prohibition. U.S. utilities were allowed to compete for the foreign business opportunities created by the privatization of national utilities and the need for the construction of facilities to meet increased energy demands abroad. \\n   Since 1992, U.S. utility companies have made significant investments in utility operations in the United Kingdom, Australia, Eastern Europe, the Far East and South America. These investments in foreign utilities have created domestic jobs in the fields of design, architecture, engineering, construction, and heavy equipment manufacturing. They also allow U.S. utilities an opportunity to diversify and grow. \\n   Unfortunately, the Internal Revenue Code penalizes these investments by subjecting them to double-taxation. U.S. companies with foreign operations receive tax credits for a portion of the taxes they pay to foreign countries, to reduce the double-taxation that would otherwise result from the U.S. policy of taxing worldwide income. The size of these foreign tax credits are affected by a number of factors, as U.S. tax laws recalculate the amount of foreign income that is recognized for tax credit purposes. \\n   Section 864 of the tax code allocates deductible interest expenses between the U.S. and foreign operations based on the relative book values of assets located in the U.S. and abroad. By ignoring business realities and the peculiar circumstances of U.S. utilities, this allocation rule overtaxes them. Because U.S. utilities were until recently prevented from operating abroad, their foreign plants and equipment have been recently-acquired and consequently have not been much depreciated, in contrast to their domestic assets which are in most cases fully-depreciated. Thus, a disproportionate amount of interest expenses are allocated to foreign income, reducing the foreign income base that is recognized for U.S. tax purposes thus the size of the corresponding foreign tax credits. \\n   The allocation rules increase the double-taxation of foreign income by reducing foreign tax credits, thereby increasing domestic taxation. The unfairness of this result is magnified by the fact that the interest expenses--which are the reason the foreign tax credit shrinks--are usually associated with domestically-regulated debt, which is tied to domestic production and is not as fungible as the tax code assumes. \\n   The result of this economically-irrational taxation scheme is a very high effective tax rate on certain foreign investment and a loss of U.S. foreign tax credits. Rather than face this double-tax penalty, some U.S. utilities have actually chosen not to invest overseas and others have pulled back from their initial investments. \\n   One solution to this problem is found in the legislation that I am introducing today. This remedy is to exempt from the interest allocation rules of Section 864 the debt associated with a U.S. utility's furnishing and sale of electricity or natural gas in the United States. This proposed rule is similar to the rule governing ``non-recourse'' debt, which is not subjected to foreign allocation. In both cases, lenders look to specific cash flows for repayment and specific assets as collateral. These loans are thus distinguishable from the typical risks of general credit lending transactions. \\n   The specific cash flow aspect of non-recourse financing is a critical element of the non-recourse debt exception, and logic requires that the same tax treatment should be given to analogous utility debt. Thus, my bill would exempt from allocation to foreign source income the interest on debt incurred in the trade or business of furnishing or selling electricity or natural gas in the United States. The current situation is a very real problem that must be remedied, and I urge my colleagues to support the solution I am proposing. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990527\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today in support of additional funds to be made available for Air Force Research, Development, Test and Evaluation in the Fiscal Year 2000 Department of Defense Authorization measure to be used to complete development of a state-of-the-art 3 dimensional optical imaging and tracking instrumentation data system. \\n   The 3 Data System is a laser radar system that provides high fidelity time, space, positioning information (TSPI) on test articles during flight. The instrumentation can be applied to air, ground, and sea targets. Additionally, it will provide the potential capability for over-the-horizon tracking from an airborne platform or pedestal mounted ground platform. It includes a multi-object tracking capability that will allow simultaneous tracking of up to 20 targets throughout their profile. The system will enable testing of advanced smart weapon systems; force-on-force exercises where multiple aircraft and ground vehicle tracking is involved; over water scoring of large footprint autonomous guided and unguided munitions; and enable an improvement to existing aging radar presently in service. It is mobile and can support testing at other major ranges and locations in support of other Service's requirements. \\n   The Air Force has identified the 3-Data System as having high military value as it will enable the effective evaluation of the performance of advanced weapon systems to be utilized in future conflicts. The Air Force has informed me that precision engagement is one of the emerging operational concepts in Joint Vision 2010. The 3-Data system would provide a capability to effectively evaluate the performance of advanced precision guided munitions and smart weapons prior to their use in a wartime environment. It would also directly support ongoing activities abroad through Quick Reaction Tasking that may require a multiple object tracking device to evaluate engagement profiles. This requirement is documented through 46th Test Wing strategic planning initiatives, developmental program test plans, and munitions strategic planning roadmaps.  \\n   The Air Force is presently attempting to meet this requirement through existing radar systems and optical tracking systems which cannot track multiple objects to the fidelity levels required and which require extensive post-mission data reduction times. This system will provide the capability to effectively track multiple targets simultaneously. \\n   Mr. President, I thank the Committee for their willingness to support this amendment. The 3-Data System will play a important role in enabling the Air Force to evaluate the capabilities and limitations of multiple smart weapons and their delivery systems during their develpoment. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990527\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Defense Jobs and Trade Promotion Act of 1999. This bill, cosponsored by Senator Feinstein and 16 of our colleagues, will eliminate a provision of tax law which discriminates against United States exporters of defense products. \\n   Other nations have systems of taxation which rely less on corporate income taxes and more on value-added taxes. By rebating the value-added taxes for products that are exported, these nations lower the costs of their exports and provide their companies a competitive advantage that is not based on quality, ingenuity, or resources but rather on tax policy. \\n   In an attempt to level the playing field, our tax code allows U.S. companies to establish Foreign Sales Corporations (FSCs) through which U.S.-manufactured products may be exported. A portion of the profits from FSC sales are exempted from corporate income taxes, to mitigate the advantage that other countries give their exporters through value-added tax rebates. \\n   But the tax benefits of a FSC are cut in half for defense exporters. This 50% limitation is the result of a compromise enacted 23 years ago as part of  the predecessor to the FSC provisions. This compromise was not based on policy considerations, but instead merely split the difference between members who believed that the U.S. defense industry was so dominant in world markets that the foreign tax advantages were inconsequential, and members who believed that all U.S. exporters should be treated equally. \\n   Today, U.S. defense manufacturers face intense competition from foreign businesses. With the sharp decline in the defense budget over the past decade, exports of defense products play a prominent role in maintaining a viable U.S. defense industrial base. It makes no sense to allow differences in international tax systems to stand as an obstacle to exports of U.S. defense products. We must level the international playing field for U.S. defense product manufacturers. \\n   The fifty percent exclusion for sales of defense products makes even less sense when one considers that the sale of every defense product to a foreign government requires the determination of both the President and the Congress that the sale will strengthen the security of the United States and promote world peace. This is more than a matter of fair treatment for all U.S. exporters. National security is enhanced when our allies use U.S.-manufactured military equipment, because of its compatibility with equipment used by our armed forces. \\n   The Department of Defense supports repeal of this provision. In an August 26, 1998 letter, Deputy Secretary of Defense John Hamre wrote Treasury Secretary Rubin about the FSC. Hamre wrote, ``The Department of Defense (DoD) supports extending the full benefits of the FSC exemption to defense exporters.*.*.*.[P]utting defense and non-defense companies on the same footing would encourage defense exports that would promote standardization and interoperability of equipment among our allies. It also could result in a decrease in the cost of defense products to the Department of Defense.'' \\n   The bill we are introducing today supports the DoD recommendation. It repeals the provision of the Foreign Sales Corporation laws that discriminates against U.S. defense product manufacturers, enhancing both the competitiveness of U.S. companies in world markets and our national security. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990526\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today Senator GRAHAM and I introduce legislation that would help protect Florida from economic devastation in the event of a catastrophic windstorm or other peril. \\n   Our legislation would amend Section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code to grant tax-exempt status to the Florida Windstorm Underwriting Association (FWUA), the Florida Residential Property and Casualty Joint Underwriting Association (JUA) and similar state-chartered, not-for-profit insurers serving markets in which commercial insurance is not available. The FWUA and JUA are non-profit entities established by the state to provide property and casualty insurance coverage in those markets not adequately served by other insurers. \\n   In most years, Florida is not hit by a major hurricane or natural catastrophe. In those years, the FWUA and JUA take in more premiums than are paid out in claims or expenses. Since these entities are not-for-profit, state law prevents those funds from being distributed--they are instead literally saved for a severely rainy or windy day. Nonetheless, the Internal Revenue Code requires 35% of those funds to be sent to Washington as federal income taxes rather than used to fund reserves. Designating the FWUA and JUA as tax-exempt will help Florida to accumulate the necessary reserves to pay claims brought on by a catastrophe. This bill gives the two Florida catastrophe funds the same tax-exempt status that is already enjoyed by a number of not-for-profit insurance provers. \\n   State law authorizes the FWUA and the JUA to assess property insurance policyholders throughout Florida to pay for losses generated by catastrophic storms or other perils. Thus, the benefits of the tax exemption would reduce the frequency and severity of assessments levied against individual policyholders. Greater funds would be available to cover losses which otherwise would be paid for by higher assessments on Florida policyholders--cutting taxes for the approximately 5,000,000 property owners in the state of Florida. \\n   This legislation has the bipartisan support of the entire Florida Congressional delegation in addition to strong backing from Governor Jeb Bush, the State Insurance Commissioner, the Florida Senate President and Florida's House Speaker. And this change in the tax code would result in only a negligible loss of federal tax revenue, according to Joint Tax. \\n   Our legislation is extremely important to homeowners and businesses throughout the state of Florida, all of whom are subject to assessment if reserves are not sufficient to pay claims in the event of a severe hurricane or other catastrophe. With hundreds of miles of magnificent coastline, Florida remains sensitive to the perils of nature. Enactment of our legislation permits Florida to prepare for the next Hurricane Andrew while alleviating some of the economic hardship exacted on Florida property owners. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990519\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, two years ago in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, we included a provision to correct an unfair and unsound tax policy of the Clinton Administration concerning business meal deductions. The 1993 Clinton tax increases included a reduction in the percentage of business meal expenses that could be deducted, from 80 percent down to 50 percent. The Administration marketed this as an attack on the ``three martini lunch,'' but the tax increase was in fact a big blow to the wallets and pocketbooks of working class Americans whose jobs require them to be stranded far from home. \\n   Workers who are covered by federal ``hours of service'' regulations--long-haul truckers, airline flight attendants and pilots, long distance bus drivers, some merchant mariners and railroad workers--have no choice but to eat their meals on the road. Their meal expenses are a necessary and unavoidable part of their jobs. The Clinton Administration's business meal tax increase hit these occupations hard. For the average trucker, making between $32,000 and $36,000 annually, this tax increase might be greater than $1,000 per year. This is a lot of money to these hard-working taxpayers. \\n   Congress addressed this inequity in 1997, passing a provision that would gradually raise the meal deduction percentage back to 80 percent for these workers. But a slow, gradual fix is not good enough. Today, Senator KOHL, Senator GRASSLEY, and I are introducing a bill that would immediately restore the 80 percent deduction for truckers, flight crews, and other workers limited by the federal ``hours of service'' regulations. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990514\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today Senator BOB GRAHAM and I, along with 17 of our colleagues, are introducing legislation to modernize the tax rules that apply to real estate investment trusts (``REITs''). \\n   This legislation is designed to remove barriers in the tax laws that impose unnecessary administrative burdens and make it more difficult for REITs to compete in an evolving marketplace. Our bill is similar to a proposal included in the President's Fiscal Year 2000 budget that permits REITs to establish a new type of subsidiary called a ``taxable REIT subsidiary'' (``TRS''). As with the President's proposal, the legislation we introduce today would permit REITs to establish a TRS to provide non-customary services to their tenants and to provide services to third parties. In return for these new rules, the TRS would be subject to a number of rules designed to prevent any income from being shifted out of the taxable subsidiary to the REIT. \\n   Congress created REITs in 1960 to enable small investors to invest in real estate. The REIT provisions were modeled after the rules that applied to mutual funds. If a number of requirements are met, a corporation electing to be a REIT may deduct all dividends paid to its shareholders. One of the major requirements for REIT status is that REITs must distribute virtually all of their taxable income to their shareholders. Thus, unlike other C corporations that tend to retain most of their earnings, the income tax burden for REITs is shifted to the shareholder level. Unlike partnerships, REITs cannot pass losses through to their investors. \\n   REITs are subject to a number of rules to ensure their primary focus is real estate activities. For example, at least 75% of a REIT's assets must be comprised of rental real estate, mortgages, cash items and government securities. A REIT also must satisfy two income tests. First, at least 75% of a REIT's annual gross income must consist of real property rents, mortgage interest, gain from the sale of a real estate asset and certain other real estate-related sources. Second, at least 95% of a REIT's annual gross income must be derived from the income items from the above 75% test plus other ``passive income'' sources such as dividends and any type of interest. In addition, a REIT cannot own more than 10% of the voting securities of a non-REIT corporation, and the securities of a single non-REIT corporation cannot be worth more than 5% of the REIT's assets. \\n   Although REITs were created in 1960, they did not really become a significant part of the real estate marketplace until the 1990s--partly because the original legislation did not permit REITs to manage their own property. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 changed this, by permitting REITs to manage their own properties through the provision of ``customary services'' to tenants. \\n   The market capitalization of REITs grew from about $13 billion at the end of 1991 to over $140 billion today. The taxes generated from REITs similarly have increased, with dividends from public REITs increasing from about $1 billion in 1991 to more than $8 billion today. While REITs remain a small portion of the entire real estate sector--in the range of 10% nationally--they account for as much as half of some sectors that require immense amounts of capital, such as shopping centers. While the REIT industry has come a long way in recent years, it continues to fulfill its original mission: permitting small investors access to attractive real estate investments. Almost 90% of REIT shareholders are individuals either investing directly or through mutual funds. \\n   Although REITs have seen remarkable growth in the 1990s, their ability to meet new competitive pressures in the real estate sector is in question as a result of tax law limitations on their activities. These rules limit the ability of REITs to provide full services to their tenants and to third parties. In general, REITs may only provide services to their tenants which the IRS has determined to be ``customary'' in the business, meaning services already provided by the typical real estate company in the market. REITs may only provide real estate-related services to third parties through preferred stock subsidiaries which they can own but not control. REITs are thus prohibited from offering leading edge, full service options to their tenants and limited in the use of their expertise to serve third parties. This presents competitive problems for REITs as the real estate marketplace has evolved and property owners have sought to provide a range of services to their tenants and other customers. \\n   As a result, REITs increasingly have been unable to compete with privately-held partnerships and other more exclusive forms of ownership. Today, the rules prevent REITs from offering the same types of customer services as their competitors, even as such services are becoming more central to marketing efforts. Examples abound: (1) offering concierge services to office and apartment tenants to pick up tickets or dry cleaning, to walk pets, etc.; (2) offering a branded credit card at shopping malls, with rebates to be used as store credits at stores in the mall; (3) high speed Internet hook-ups, including enhanced telecommunications services (e.g., creating and maintaining a website) offered by a landlord's partner; (4) partnering with an office supply provider to offer reduced prices on office supplies; and (5) pick-up and delivery services at self-storage rentals. \\n   Without greater flexibility to provide competitive services to tenants and other customers, REITs will become less and less competitive with others in the real estate marketplace. REITs will have to wait for services to be deemed ``customary.'' As a practical matter, that means a REIT must wait until the IRS concludes that almost everybody else has been providing the service. If a REIT is forced to lag the market, it can be neither competitive nor provide its investors with a satisfactory return on their investment. Certainly, this is not consistent with what Congress intended when it created REITs, and when it modified the REIT rules over the years. In keeping with the Congressional mandate to provide a sensible and effective way for the average investor to benefit from ownership of income-producing real estate, REITs should be able to provide a range of services through taxable subsidiaries. \\n   The Administration's proposed Fiscal Year 2000 Budget acknowledges this problem. The Administration proposes modernizing REIT rules to permit REITs, on a limited basis, to use taxable subsidiaries to provide the services necessary to compete in the evolving real estate marketplace. The Administration proposal is a good start, but I believe additional refinements would further promote competitiveness. The legislation that we are introducing today builds upon the Administration proposal. Our bill addresses the  appropriate needs of the REIT industry and its investors in a manner consistent with the underlying rationale for REITs and the requirements of the highly competitive, evolving real estate marketplace. \\n   This legislation would give greater flexibility to REITs by permitting them to establish ``taxable REIT subsidiaries'' (``TRSs'') that could provide non-customary services to tenants and services to third parties. The 5% and 10% asset tests would not apply to the TRS. REITs would continue to be subject to the 75% asset tests so the value of their TRS, together with the value of other non-real estate assets, could not exceed 25% of the total value of a REIT's assets. In addition, the REIT would have to continue to satisfy the 95% and 75% income tests, with dividends or interest from a TRS to a REIT counting towards the 95% test, but not the 75% test. Accordingly, at least 75% of a REIT's gross income would continue to consist of rents, mortgage interest, real estate capital gains and the other miscellaneous real estate-related items already listed in the Code. The income a TRS would receive from both third parties and REIT tenants would be fully subject to corporate tax. \\n   To ensure that a TRS could not inappropriately reduce its corporate tax liability by shifting income to the REIT, the bill includes a number of stringent rules that limit the relationship between the REIT and the TRS. To prevent the TRS from making excessive intra-party interest payments to its affiliated REIT, the proposal contains two safeguards. One, it would apply the current anti-earnings stripping provisions of Code section 163(j) to payments between a REIT and its TRS. This would prevent the TRS from deducting intra-party interest beyond a modest amount regulated by objective criteria in the Code. Two, a 100% excise tax would be imposed on any interest payments by a TRS to its affiliated REIT to the extent the interest rate was above a commercially-reasonable rate. \\n   Also, to be certain that a TRS could not reduce its tax obligations by deducting rents to its affiliated REIT, our legislation would retain the current rules under which any payments to a REIT by a related party would not be considered qualified rents for purposes of the REIT gross income tests. The only exception would be when a TRS rents less than 10% of a REIT-owned property and pays rents to the REIT comparable to the rents the REIT charges to its unrelated tenants at the same property. Under this exception, any rents paid to the REIT that turn out to be above comparable rents would be subject to a 100% excise tax. \\n   Under our bill, a 100% excise tax is also imposed on any rents a REIT charges its tenants that are inflated to disguise charges for services rendered to the tenant by its affiliated TRS. Limited exceptions would be made when: (1) the TRS charges the same amounts for its services to both REIT tenants and third parties; (2) rents for comparable space are the same regardless of whether the TRS provides a service to the tenant; and (3) the TRS recognizes income for its services at least equal to 150% of its direct costs of providing the service to an affiliated REIT's tenants. \\n   To discourage a REIT from allocating its expenses to its TRS (which would reduce the TRS's corporate tax obligation), the proposal would impose a 100% excise tax on any improper cost allocations between a REIT and its TRS. The Treasury Department would issue guidance on proper ways to allocate such costs. \\n   Finally, the bill proposes to eliminate the use of preferred stock subsidiaries by REITs. These subsidiaries, which have been established pursuant to IRS letter rulings since 1988, allow a REIT to provide services to third parties. While the asset test rules prevent a REIT from owning more than 10% of the voting securities of these subsidiaries, they typically own more than 95% of the value of the subsidiary. We propose to eliminate these subsidiaries by prohibiting REITs from owning more than 10% of the vote or the value in another corporation other than a TRS. REITs would be given three years to convert, tax-free, their preferred stock subsidiaries to taxable REIT subsidiaries. \\n   In addition, the bill includes some miscellaneous changes to the REIT rules that were under consideration when Congress approved a REIT simplification package a few years ago. The first provision deals with health care property. Under current law, a REIT can conduct a trade or business using property acquired through foreclosure for 90 days after it acquired such property, if it makes a ``foreclosure property'' election. After this period, the REIT can only conduct the trade or business through an independent contractor from whom the REIT does not derive any income. A health care REIT faces special challenges in using these rules when its lease of a nursing home or other health care property expires. \\n   To remedy these challenges and to ensure that care to patients remains uninterrupted, the proposal would make two technical changes to the REIT foreclosure rules. First, the foreclosure property rules would be extended to include leases that terminate (they already apply to leases that are breached). Second, for purposes of the foreclosure rules, a health care provider would not be disqualified as an independent contractor solely because the REIT receives rental income from the provider with respect to one or more other properties. For this purpose, other rules would be made to ensure that the terms of leases of other properties could not be manipulated to circumvent this rule. \\n   Another provision deals with the 95% distribution rule. From 1960 through 1980, REITs and mutual funds shared a requirement to distribute at least 90% of their taxable income. Since 1980, REITs have had to distribute 95% of their taxable income. The proposal would restore the 90% distribution requirement. \\n   Mr. President, I believe this is a major improvement in the REIT rules that preserves the original intent of Congress when it first created REITs in 1960, while permitting the industry to adapt to a changing marketplace. Most importantly, these REIT modernization rules would not expand the activities that can be conducted within the REIT, they simply give the REIT greater flexibility to establish fully-taxable subsidiaries that will enable the REIT to better serve its customers. \\n   This legislation is supported by the American Resort Development Association, the International Council of Shopping Centers, the National Apartment Association, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, the American Seniors Housing Association, the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, the National Association of Industrial and Office Properties, the National Association of Realtors, the National Multi Housing Council, and the National Realty Committee. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990512\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Affordable Housing Opportunity Act of 1999. My colleague from my home state, BOB GRAHAM, my colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator SANTORUM, and 42 other members of the Senate join me as original cosponsors of this effort to make sure that the Low Income Housing Tax Credit is not undercut by the effects of inflation. \\n   The Low Income Housing Tax Credit is one federal housing program that works. It works to produce affordable rental housing by allowing states to distribute tax credits to those who invest in apartments for low income families. It works because it is decentralized, it is market-oriented, and it relies on the private sector. \\n   The Low Income Housing Tax Credit works because it is based on sound economics. This is in stark contrast to the alternative government approach to the problem of a scarcity of privately owned, affordable housing units, the approach of rent control. Under rent  control, owners are restricted in the price they can charge for their apartments. Since this dramatically reduces the return on their investment in housing, potential owners of rental units take their money elsewhere. The result, confirmed in a study of rent control in California in the early 1990s, is that rent control actually reduces the number of rental units available for low income families. \\n   There is a better way. The Low Income Housing Tax Credit is that way. Under this program, tax credits are allocated by states and their localities to investors in low income housing. In return for agreeing to charge low rents for the units produced, the investors receive a tax credit that makes up for the financial risk of the investment. Instead of mandating low rents, the program provides an incentive for property owners to charge low rents. \\n   And, as Adam Smith would have predicted, this incentive does the job. Since 1987, state agencies have allocated over $3 billion in Housing Credits to help finance nearly one million apartments for low income families, including 70,000 apartments in 1997. In my own state of Florida, the Credit is responsible for helping finance over 52,000 apartments for low income families, including 3,300 apartments in 1997. The demand for Housing Credits nationwide currently outstrips supply by more than three to one. \\n   Despite the success of the Housing Credit in meeting affordable rental housing needs, the apartments it helps finance can barely keep pace with the nearly 100,000 low cost apartments which are demolished, abandoned, or converted to market rents each year. This is because the credit has been set at an annual amount of $1.25 per resident of each state, since its creation in 1986. To make up for the loss in value of the credit due to inflation, we propose to increase this amount to $1.75 per resident and to index the amount for future inflation. It has been estimated that this will increase the stock of critically needed low income apartments by 27,000 each year. \\n   There has long existed in this body a dedication to affordable housing, an interest that knows no party lines. One of the major, early proponents of federally supported affordable housing was Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio, known in his day as Mr. Republican, whose monument chimes regularly just a few hundred yards from here. With this strong, bipartisan pedigree, I have no hesitation in asking my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me to enact this proposal--which is similar to one contained in the President's budget and is supported by the nation's governors and mayors and the affordable housing community--to ensure the continued vitality of a program that works. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990511\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I am here today because finally, Tax Freedom Day has arrived--the day the average American has earned enough income to cover his or her Federal, State and local taxes for the year. Only today--after one-third of the year has already passed--have our working men and women earned enough money to pay their taxes for the year! This is truly amazing, and it is also truly wrong. \\n   Tax Freedom Day has moved successively later into the year for the past 7 years, as the Federal Government seeks to claim a larger and larger portion of the American family income. Since 1993, Federal tax revenues have grown 52 percent faster than personal income growth. And last year alone, Federal revenues grew 80 percent faster than personal income. \\n   Florida's Tax Freedom Day is even later--Floridians will not finish earning enough to pay their taxes for the year until Friday, May 14. They also shoulder the 5th heaviest total tax burden in the country. \\n   In 1999, Federal, State and local governments are projected to collect an average of $10,298 in tax revenue for every person in the country. This year, the Federal Government will collect more tax revenue as a share of GDP--that is 20.7 percent--than at any time since 1944. This is the highest level in peacetime history. \\n   If that isn't enough to put the high Federal tax take into perspective, let me share with you a few examples of just how much taxes impede our freedom every day of the year. \\n   I brought with me a daily tax clock to illustrate just how many different times we are taxed in ways we may not even realize. Think about the different things you do in the course of your average day. Planning your family's summer vacation? Forty percent of the cost of an airline ticket is taxes! When you drive to and from work today, 54 percent of the price of a gallon of gasoline is taxes. Did you call your mother on Mother's Day? Fifty percent of the cost of your phone bill is due to taxes. \\n   Taxes infringe on our freedom--our freedom to work, our freedom to invest and our freedom to provide for our families. It is more apparent than ever that the mammoth Federal Government we have created will never be satisfied--if there is money to be had, the Federal Government will take it. \\n   That is why it is more important than ever to provide tax relief to our families. We have a balanced budget, and soon we will be working with a Federal surplus. If the Federal Government has its way, this overpayment of taxes by the American people will be spent in Washington on new Federal programs. We need to give the American people their money back. I have proposed a tax plan which will do just that by, No. 1, providing tax relief for all American income taxpayers, No. 2, encouraging economic growth and, No. 3, ensuring U.S. technological leadership in the 21st century. \\n   We need to ensure the United States keeps its status as an economic powerhouse in the next millennium. The Federal Government's role in ensuring this happens is to cut taxes and get out of the way to give the American people the freedom to pursue their own dream--not Washington's. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990511\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join my colleague JOHN BREAUX in sponsoring the Medicare Psychiatric Hospital Prospective payment System Act of 1999. \\n   This legislation will ensure the continuance of available impatient psychiatric care by reforming how Medicare pays for services in free-standing psychiatric hospitals and psychiatric units of general hospitals. It will establish a prospective payment system (PPS) Currently psychiatric hospitals are the only institutional providers of care under Medicare not scheduled to move to a PPS system. \\n   The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) made major changes in the way psychiatric hospitals are paid. It reduced incentive payments and imposed a limit on what will be paid. The result of this was that many of these providers were hit by a big cut in the first year with no transition period to adjust to the reductions. It is important that these cuts not be continued because patient care may be put at risk. A recent study found that 84% of psychiatric hospitals had payment reductions due to BBA. The average margin went from minus 3% to negative 8.7%. \\n   This legislation proposes to transition psychiatric inpatient providers to a PPS which will allow these institutions to be able to plan and adjust for the future and insure their ability to provide quality care. The proposal also provides a measure of financial relief by limiting payment reductions to no more than 5% in the next two years. This relief will then be paid back in a few years under PPS. After the third year, PPS will be in effect and per diem rates can be adjusted downward by the Secretary of Health and Human Services to pay back savings temporarily lost through the limitation of initial payment reductions. The goal is for the bill to be budget neutral over five years and fully comply with the BBA. \\n   The most important feature of this legislation is that it moves psychiatric facilities out of a cost based system and into a system where they will be paid prospectively, like most other Medicare Providers, and can manage their finances effectively to provide high quality psychiatric care. \\n   I urge my colleagues to join me in co-sponsoring this important piece of legislation. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990506\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I thank Senator GRAMM for providing this time to me to make a statement with regard to a tax cut proposal that I have. \\n   Mr. President, my job as chairman of the Joint Economic Committee is to help Congress stay focused on the right policies to keep the U.S. economy energized. What that comes down to is finding ways to make sure Washington does less of what today it does most--tax, spend, and regulate--in order to let the American people do more of what they do best--which is to build, create and innovate. \\n   With that in mind, I instructed the JEC staff to focus on creating a tax plan that would accomplish three goals: first, provide tax relief for all American income taxpayers; second, promote even stronger economic growth; and third, ensure continued technological leadership in the 21st century. The plan I would like to talk about today accomplishes these three goals, and does so within the parameters of the on-budget surplus as estimated in this year's budget resolution. It does not use one penny from the Social Security surplus. \\n   As Ronald Reagan once said, when he was defining a taxpayer--``that's someone who works for the Federal Government but doesn't have to take a civil service examination.'' This comment really gets to the heart of how the size and scope of the Federal Government affects the way we live our lives. Americans are spending more and more time working to give more and more of their hard-earned dollars in taxes every year to the Federal Government. \\n   According to the non-partisan Tax Foundation, the average dual-income family will work until May 11 this year to pay their federal state and local taxes. So, as of today, the average American family has not even finished working to pay off their taxes for 1999. \\n   This year, the Federal Government will collect more tax revenue as a share of GDP than at any time since 1944. This is the highest level in peacetime history--20.7 percent of GDP consumed by the Federal Government. \\n   Since 1993, federal tax revenues have grown 52 percent faster than personal income growth. Last year alone, federal revenues grew 80 percent faster than personal income. \\n   We have a balanced budget in 1999 and we've got balanced budgets as far as the eye can see. Soon, we'll have a federal surplus as far as the eye can see. \\n   Our challenge now is to deal with that surplus. And, I think it's easy to see what will happen to this overpayment by the American taxpayer--if we leave it in Washington's hands. There will be numerous new government programs and they will be paid for by the Federal surplus. \\n   We have to change the terms of debate--and we have to do it now before the surplus is spent. First, let's not forget that the American economy does not exist to feed the Federal budget. Now that the budget is balanced, we have to get our priorities straight. \\n   To begin with: there is no such thing as ``public money.'' Every dollar of the Federal surplus was paid into the U.S. Treasury by American taxpayers. If we have a persistent surplus, we have to give the money back. \\n   For years, my fellow Republicans and I argued that it was wrong for the Government to spend more than it took in. We were right. But now, it is equally wrong for the Government to take in more than it spends. \\n   Yes, we should cut taxes so that people can keep more of what they earn. Yes, we should cut taxes because lower taxes spur economic growth. But the real rationale for lowering taxes--the reason tax cuts are an article of faith in the Republican Party--is that high taxes trespass on our freedom--our freedom to work, our freedom to invest, our freedom to support our families. \\n   So in my mind, it is not a matter of if we cut, but how much, and how can we maximize the pro-growth impact of whatever tax cuts we decide to enact. \\n   With these thoughts in mind, I would like to focus on what they Joint Economic Committee staff has come up with as a way to give the American income taxpayer meaningful tax relief, promote savings and economic growth, and ensure the United States remains a technological leader in the 21st century. And, Mr. President, I would like to elaborate on how this plan will accomplish each of these goals. \\n   The first goal is tax cuts for all American income taxpayers. \\n   Under this plan we would double the standard deduction to $14,400 for married filers and raise the standard deduction for single filers to $7,200. Increasing the standard deduction would provide much-needed relief to all low-income taxpayers. Moreover, this provision would significantly reduce the much-discussed marriage penalty and simplify the Tax Code. Nearly three-  quarters of all taxpayers use the standard deduction and would benefit from this increase. \\n   In addition, our plan would repeal the 1993 Clinton tax increase on Social Security benefits. In 1993, President Clinton imposed this tax increase on the elderly's benefits because he said it was needed to eliminate the budget deficit. Since there is no longer a deficit, we no longer need this tax. It is time to repeal this unnecessary surcharge on Social Security recipients. \\n   The second goal is economic growth. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990506\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Thank you, Mr. President. And I thank Senator GRAMM for yielding me time. \\n   This was an issue that I did not expect to be drawn into as far as the debate was concerned. But as I have listened to it, and as I have observed my colleagues over the last several days, as the lobbying on both sides of this issue has been going on, and seeing people move back and forth, I have become concerned about how people are making decisions. \\n   Finally, we have gotten down to the crux of the matter here, and that is, at least in my opinion, how monetary policy in the United States is going to be carried out. \\n   I believe it is so important that we focus on the issue of monetary policy, because one of the underlying strengths, one of the major factors in the economic growth that we have experienced for almost 16 years is the role of the Federal Reserve, a Federal Reserve that has been committed to price stability. \\n   To do something that will weaken the influence of the Federal Reserve with respect to monetary policy would be a tragic mistake. \\n   Here is my reasoning as to how this will come about. The Treasury is selling their idea to Members that all we really want to do is give the bankers a choice--that seems to be a fair and reasonable thing to do--let them decide. \\n   I was in the banking business. This is really not a choice. You are saying to the bankers, you make a choice about where you are going to put this. They know where the cost of capital is the cheapest, and the cost of capital is going to be the cheapest in an operating subsidiary. \\n   Why is the operating subsidiary going to be the cheapest cost to them? Because there is a subsidy attached to the bank, and so the bankers naturally will go to where their costs are the cheapest. They will, in fact, put these new powers into an operating subsidiary. Having done that, there is no longer a need for them to be involved in a holding company. The holding company is the vehicle, if you will, that allows the Federal Reserve to carry out its monetary policy. \\n   The second thing that is going to occur is by voting for the use of an operating subsidiary, you are really saying you want the taxpayers to expand the subsidy that goes into the banking industry or into the financial services industry. That is an individual decision that people can make. But I think it is wrong to try to approach this question about whether I am for the bankers or whether I am not for the bankers. This is an issue about whether you want to have a monetary policy that is of value to this country. \\n   I ask Members to consider what has happened in this country in these past 16 years as far as growth is concerned. The foundation of that growth has been the commitment that this Federal Reserve, and Alan Greenspan in particular, has had to the objective of price stability. We have finally reached the point where we have attained price stability, and we are talking about tinkering around with legislation that could lessen the influence of the Federal Reserve. \\n   As Senator DOMENICI indicated earlier, as you lessen that influence, you are going to increase the influence in the executive branch over the banking industry and monetary policy in this country. That would be a tragedy. \\n   I ask my colleagues who may be wavering on this issue, this is not a choice between Secretary Rubin or Alan Greenspan or commercial banks. This is a decision about monetary policy in this country and who should, in fact, have control of it. \\n   I ask you to support the position outlined by the chairman of the Banking Committee, Senator GRAMM. \\n   I yield the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-19990506\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I move to lay that motion on the table. \\n   The motion to lay on the table was agreed to. \\n   Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990505\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I thank the Chair. \\n   Mr. President, I thank Senator GRAMM for yielding me the time. I have a comment or two with respect to the process that we have gone through in putting this legislation together. \\n   I commend Senator GRAMM. I can't think of a time in my now 17 years in the Congress where I have had a chairman of a committee that has spent as much time with the other members of the committee, walking through a particular piece of legislation, each aspect of it, making sure that each of us was prepared and educated on the various issues. There are some difficult issues that face us--the whole issue of CRA, unitary thrifts, the mixing of banking and commerce, the issue of operating subsidiaries versus affiliates, all of them complicated. \\n   I can remember not too many years ago when there was this sense in America that the model which should be followed was the Japanese banking system that people looked at and said, we ought to look at Japan, the dynamic economy they were producing in the late 1980s. I think about how much things have changed in those 10 years. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-19990505\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I will be glad to yield for a moment. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-3-19990505\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. It is a dramatic change, and here we are. We have been talking about this legislation for all those years and we haven't made the modifications we needed to make. I hope we will be successful this time. \\n   I rise in support of the underlying bill and in opposition to the Sarbanes substitute. We all know that legislation to overhaul the bank regulatory structure is long overdue, and I join many of my colleagues in thanking the chairman for his hard work in writing this bill and bringing it to the floor. \\n   I will begin by quoting the words of the Senate Banking Committee report, which I believe presents a strong case for financial modernization. It states:  \\n   The argument for legislation to rationalize our financial structure is strong. Regulatory and court decisions have eliminated many of the barriers between commercial and investment banking. The barriers separating commercial banks from investment banks have been perforated in both directions. Finally, changes in the technology and practice of financial intermediation have rendered the restrictions of Glass-Steagall increasingly ineffective and obsolete.  \\n   There is nothing particularly remarkable about that language, Mr. President. In fact, those same arguments will be made by many of my colleagues here today. But what is remarkable about the statement I just read is that it comes from a committee report on banking legislation in 1991. Just as I believed those words to be significant 8 years ago, I believe them to be even more so today. Unfortunately, there was no overhaul of our banking system in 1991. And despite much hard work and a clear need for action, there has been none since. We are long overdue for this debate and I am pleased the Senate is addressing this important issue. \\n   Freedom and free enterprise have allowed our corporate and financial institutions to respond to changing times and to adapt to a changing financial environment. But this ability has reached its limits within the confines of present law. For our financial institutions to continue to grow, to compete, and to evolve, we must give them a new legislative climate in which to operate. That is the purpose of the bill before us today. \\n   Mr. President, our banking system is truly a model for the world. Emerging economies from Asia to Africa to Central Europe look to the United States for the blueprint and technical expertise to build an effective financial infrastructure. This is happening because we have found a remarkable balance between community banks and global institutions, between the regulators and the regulated, between the States and the Federal Government, and between ordinary people and the money they need to finance their hopes and dreams. In recent years, we have witnessed a wave of high-profile mergers, as institutions across the sectors hope to create ``synergy'' from offering a broad range of financial products to an expanding global customer base. For their part, many smaller, community-based institutions are using the new regulatory authorities to offer their customers one-stop shopping for individual financial needs--from ordinary retail banking to insurance products and securities instruments. \\n   All of this is very important to the continued financial well-being of our Nation and to the global competitiveness of our financial services industry. However, the expansions I speak of are not taking place with the approval of the Congress and are not occurring through any action on our part to change the law. Rather, these things are happening because--as the 1991 report mentioned--court decisions and the broadened interpretations of present law by the banking regulators have allowed them to take place in an ad hoc manner. In order to access the right to affiliate with other sectors, financial companies have to jump over increasingly complicated regulatory hurdles in order to adapt and survive. It is high time Congress weighed in on this important trend. It is high time we cleared the way for these affiliations and repealed the underlying web of Depression-era restrictions on our banking industry. \\n   That is what we accomplish in the bill before us today, Mr. President. This legislation allows companies to diversify holdings by lifting the prohibitions on affiliations among banks, insurance companies, and securities firms, thus allowing them to compete fully in a free-market environment. If Congress fails to act, we will once  again limit the potential of our financial sector and we will continue to impose needless and unnecessary regulatory burdens on individual financial institutions. The other body is moving with its own legislation. The Senate needs to act now to ensure that our financial sector is on solid footing for the new century. \\n   The bill before us repeals the Depression-era Glass-Steagall law prohibiting affiliations between commercial and investment banks. It allows banks and insurance companies \\n   to affiliate under the same corporate umbrella. It contains provisions outlining the appropriate regulation of bank sales of insurance, and it allows banks with assets of less than $1 billion to engage in a broader range of financial services through operating subsidiaries. Of course, Mr. President, the relationships between these entities are carefully constructed to ensure institutional safety and soundness and that the taxpayer-insured deposits of retail banking institutions are protected. \\n   The structure provided for in this legislation will end the ad hoc expansion and administration of our banking sector and provide the industry with a clear roadmap for the 21st century. In my view, it will lead to greater stability, enhanced safety and soundness, and improved choices for customers and consumers. \\n   So I urge my colleagues to support passage of this important bill and defeat the Sarbanes substitute. \\n   With that, I yield the floor. \\n   Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990505\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I thank Senator GRAMM and the other Members on the floor for this time. I will be brief. \\n   I have spoken on this issue throughout my time in the Senate serving on the Banking Committee which now is into its 11th year. I also make these comments from the perspective of an individual who was president of a small bank in southwest Florida for 5 years out of a 16-year banking career. \\n   One would think, listening to the comments that have been made by the distinguished Senator from Maryland, that we were proposing to repeal CRA. We are not proposing that at all. There may be Members who want to do that, but that is not what the issue is about. The issue is about regulatory overkill. \\n   This little bank that I was president of had about $60 million in assets--very small bank--in a community that was developed, one of these Florida developments, that began in the late 1950s. To suggest that this small community bank in a very well-defined and confined market was not providing resources to that market is just absurd. If we did not lend money into that market, we would, in fact, have gone broke. So all I am suggesting is the amendment being proposed here is being sold as if we were trying to repeal CRA. The information I have is with the committee position: Only 2.8 percent of the total assets of the banking industry in America are affected by this carve-out, 2.8 percent. There were 16,000 banks audited over a 9-year period and only three of those banks--I am talking about small banks now--only three of those banks were found to be significantly out of compliance. \\n   Small banks in America need some regulatory relief. That is all we are suggesting here. Again, my experience was this little bank of $60 million in assets had to assign one individual whose job it was to put pins into a map in our market showing where we had made real estate loans. That is all we had to do. But I had to assign one person to do that. She had to put programs into effect in the bank to make sure we were complying with lending to our community. It was the only place we could have loaned. \\n   So the idea that we needed to have the Community Reinvestment Act for my bank and for small community banks is absurd. I ask my colleagues to reject the amendment and to support the committee position. \\n   I yield the remainder of my time. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990325\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Not yet. We have not used our time yet. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-19990325\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I understand I have now 6 minutes. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-3-19990325\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. It is my intention then to use 3 of those minutes and then to yield to my colleague, Senator GRAHAM, for the balance of the 3 minutes. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-4-19990325\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, let me, first of all, thank Senator DODD for his vote for this resolution. I respect immensely his viewpoint and what he has stated over all these years, but I respectfully disagree with him. Again, I will just point out, all we are suggesting here is that the least America can do is to say we ought to ask the United Nations to condemn Fidel Castro for his human rights violations. That is not an extreme position to take, to ask the world body to condemn Fidel Castro for human rights violations. \\n   The reason we are doing this is because I think it is appropriate to respond to the impression that has been created over these last several months after the Pope visited Cuba. There has been this kind of love affair that Cuba has changed, that the world is now going to open up. The Senator said a moment ago, if Cuba would open up, if we would open up, we could come together. \\n   Clearly, what has happened since the Pope's visit, Fidel Castro has arrested more dissidents than he has released following the Pope's visit. He has instituted new laws which restrict the freedom of speech, even more restrictive than in previous years. He arrested 15 people trying to celebrate the birthday of Martin Luther King this year, and just this month he arrested and sentenced four prominent activists for writing about the basic rights of the Cuban people.  \\n   Mr. President, it seems to me that this country, a country that has been willing to stand up in defense of human rights, basic human rights all over the globe, is doing the right thing. I ask my colleagues in the Senate to support this resolution. \\n   I yield back my time and yield the floor to Senator GRAHAM. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-5-19990325\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the resolution. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990318\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990318\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that S. Res. 57 be discharged from the Foreign Relations Committee and, further, that the Senate now proceed to its immediate consideration.  \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-19990318\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there now be 1 hour, equally divided, on the resolution and that the only amendment in order be an amendment to the preamble which is at the desk. \\n   I further ask unanimous consent that following the debate time, the resolution be set aside and the Senate proceed to a vote on the resolution, at a time to be determined by the two leaders. \\n   I finally ask that following the vote on the adoption of the resolution, the amendment to the preamble be agreed to and the preamble, as amended, be agreed to. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-3-19990318\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I yield myself 15 minutes. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-4-19990318\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Thank you, Mr. President. \\n   Mr. President, I am pleased to have this opportunity today \\n   to speak about Cuba and why the United States must make every effort to pass a resolution in Geneva at the U.N. Human Rights Commission condemning the Cuban Government. \\n   The reality which I seek to convey today is very simply stated. Fidel Castro continues to run Cuba with absolute power, based upon the failed ideals of the Marxist revolution that he led 40 years ago. He is a tyrant, a dictator, and an enemy of freedom, democracy, and respect for basic human dignity. \\n   As many of my colleagues know, I have been reflecting on my Senate career lately as I weighed my decision on seeking another term. Let me share one of those memories with you right now. \\n   It was October 19, 1987, when I announced my candidacy for the Senate. I traveled to Key West, the southern most point in the Continental United States, to make my announcement. I chose this location for one simple reason. I knew my passion for foreign policy arose from a deeply held conviction that America's freedom could not be taken for granted, that our freedom was not complete so long as others suffered under the yoke of tyranny. Only 90 miles from where I declared my aspiration to be a U.S. Senator in order to take part in the fight against the enemies of freedom, Fidel Castro ruled with a failed ideology and a cruel iron fist. \\n   It seems that I have been in the Senate for a long time--10 years--but if I were to travel to Key West today, I am sad to say, I could still point toward Cuba and ask the same questions I did on October 19, 1987: What does it mean to live in peace if there is no freedom to worship God, no freedom to choose our livelihood, no freedom to read or speak the truth or to live for the dream of handing over a better life to our children and our grandchildren? Peace without freedom is false. The Cuban people are only free to serve their masters in war and in poverty. \\n   Mr. President, I have many good friends in the Senate, and I have great respect for my colleagues. We share so much of our lives with each other each day. And even though we are divided on many issues, in our hearts there can be no division on our feelings for the suffering people of Cuba. \\n   The island so close to our shores serves as a tragic reminder of the human cost of tyranny and oppression and that freedom is not free. \\n   Let me propose today that Fidel Castro has not changed in 10 years; in fact, he has not changed in 40 years. In the history books, 40 years can be covered in a single sentence. But in Cuba, it can also be an eternity. \\n   I think about the 12 years since I made that speech. How many people have suffered and died needlessly in 12 years? How many screams of agony have reached for the heavens from Havana in 12 years? How many tears of sorrow and anguish have fallen in 12 years? I fear we will never know the true scale of suffering, even though it takes place so close to our shores. \\n   Some of us have served in the Senate for a few years, some of us for 10 or 12, and some of us have been here for 30 years or more. Think what it must be like serving instead in one of Fidel Castro's prisons for all that time. In Cuba you could be imprisoned simply for doing what we do each day, and that is engage in the debate of ideas. Think about how different our lives would be if we lived in a similar environment. \\n   I assure you, Mr. President, that the human spirit is a powerful thing. We know that throughout the world and throughout history mankind has struggled for freedom against the greatest of obstacles. That struggle lives, breathes, sweats, and thrives in Cuba today. But it does so at a great cost. \\n   I have two short stories I want to share to demonstrate the price being paid in Cuba today. \\n   There is a famous man known as Antunez. He began supporting freedom in Cuba in 1980. He has been in and out of prison for much of his adult life. As of February 1999, reports out of the prisons have him in poor health. \\n   I want to read a quote from a letter he wrote and successfully smuggled out of Cuba 2 years ago. I quote:  \\n   On March 15 [1997], it will be seven years that I have been imprisoned but I have yet to lose my faith and confidence in the final triumph of our struggle. I am proud and satisfied that they will have been unable to--and will never be able to--bend my will, because I am defending a just and noble cause, the rights of man and the freedom of my country.  \\n   A second story: I have recently seen a March 10, 1999, statement of Dr. Omar del Pozo, which I want to share with you today. He was a prisoner of conscience, sentenced to 15 years in prison for promoting democracy and civil society in Cuba. Through the intercession of Pope John Paul II, Dr. Pozo was released and exiled to Canada after serving 6 years of the sentence. \\n   It is interesting to note the comments of a man who owes his freedom from Cuba's prisons to the Pope's visit to Cuba. Listen to what he has to say about the so-called changes taking place within the Cuban Government. And I am now quoting:  \\n   In Castro's man-eating prisons, lives are swallowed, mangled, and spit out in what can only be described as his revolving-door of infamy. Some may claim that the fact that I am able to stand before you here today is because I am a product of engagement with Castro. While I am certainly grateful for the international outcry that created pressure on Castro to release me, it would be negligent of me not to recognize that as long as the dictator remains in power, there will continue to be political prisoners who are destined to become pawns to be handed over as tokens depending on the occasion.........my release in no way benefited the hundreds, perhaps thousands, of men and women who were left behind.  \\n   Dr. Pozo's statement certainly rings true--that the visit of the Pope and his personal release and exile from his home do not, counter to popular belief, indicate a new day in Cuba. \\n   He continues on in his statement. Again, I quote:  \\n   Forty years have passed, and a new millennium dawns, and still political prisoners exist in a country only 90 miles from the shores of the freest nation on earth........In the confusion of cliches Cuba has become in the mass media: Castro and cigars, Castro and tourism, Castro and baseball, the terrible tragedy of Cubans and their legitimate needs and desires takes a backseat to the priorities set by the Comandante en Jefe and his regime. The truly tragic part is that there are some who, in the name of profit, are willing to compromise justice and play by his rules, with no regard for the welfare of the Cuban people.  \\n   Just as actions indicate no improvement in the Government of Cuba, one could argue that things are not really getting worse. In fact, the recent crackdown in Cuba is only a manifestation of the nature of the ruling regime. Again, let me quote from Dr. Pozo:  \\n   These past days, I have heard even experienced Cuba observers question why Castro has raised the level of repression at this point in time, considering the many gestures of goodwill he has received internationally prior to and following the Papal visit. The only possible answer is that it is the nature of the beast. Castro can not help it any more than he can help being a totalitarian dictator. It is who he is and will always be. It is because he is motivated by one thing and one thing alone: [and that is] absolute power. He wants to continue to stand on the backs of the Cuban people and he will persecute, torture and kill in order to accomplish his goal of being Cuba's ``dictator for life.'' By now, everyone knows who Castro is and what he is capable of. From this point on, the field can only be divided between those who are willing to overlook his crimes and those who are not.   \\n   Again, I just point out, those were not my words. These are the words of an individual who was released from Castro's prison because of the pressure brought on by the international community and by the Pope's visit. What he is saying here is that nothing has changed as a result of the Pope's visit to Cuba. He is saying nothing has changed. And he is saying to us--not me saying, but he is saying to us--that ``the field can only be divided [now] between those who are willing to overlook [Castro's] crimes and those who are not.'' \\n   Mr. President, in conclusion, let me once again say freedom is not free, but it is the most valuable thing that we know; it is, in fact, the core of all human progress. Freedom has everything to do with our spiritual, physical, and political lives. Without it--without freedom--what would we do? It is important to think about this in order to appreciate the words of the brave men and women in Cuba fighting for freedom, because they are, after all, fighting for everything and paying a large price indeed. \\n   I want to reach out to my colleagues today. We loathe tyranny and oppression. So let us stand united behind our delegation in Geneva; let us proclaim our views at the United Nations Human Rights Commission. Let us stand tall and speak with unity, conviction, and strength. Let us proclaim: ``The \\n   United States of America abhors tyranny and loves freedom. We oppose the enemies of liberty and we support those struggling for LIBERTAD.'' \\n   That, Mr. President, represents the meaning of this resolution in its entirety. I hope my colleagues will join me today in making this most important statement. \\n   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. \\n   Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-5-19990318\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. There are no further speakers on my side, so I am prepared to yield back the remainder of my time. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-6-19990318\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I suggest the absence of a quorum. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990317\\n\\n    Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I come before the Senate today with my esteemed colleague and friend, Senator GRAHAM, to introduce the Florida Federal Judgeship Act of 1999. I would not be here today if I did not wholeheartedly believe that the problem facing the court system in the Middle and Southern Districts of Florida is one of the most acute judgeship problems in the nation. If judicial resources are not increased in these two districts, the problem will become irreversible. Mr. President, the situation that presently exists in Florida rises to the level of an emergency and thus, the problem needs attention today. \\n   The legislation that Senator GRAHAM and I are introducing would create seven new judgeships for the state of Florida. The Middle District would receive five new permanent judgeships, and the Southern District would receive two new permanent judgeships. These numbers were officially recommended by the United States Judicial Conference earlier this week. \\n   The Middle District of Florida is nearly 400 miles, spanning from the Georgia border on the northeast side to the south of Naples on the southwest coast of Florida. This district includes, among others, the cities of Jacksonville, Orlando, and Tampa. The Southern District encompasses Ft. Lauderdale and Miami, along with other cities in the southern portion of the state. \\n   Additional judgeship positions have not been created for these districts since 1990. Since this time, the Middle District alone has had a 62 percent increase in the total number of cases filed. Moreover, Florida's population has increased nearly twice as fast as the nation during the 1990s. By 2025, the United States Census Bureau projects Florida will surpass New York as the third largest state with 20.7 million residents. \\n   Each year, Florida becomes a winter home to people from all over the United States and the world. In addition, the Middle and Southern Districts  are home to major tourist attractions such as Disney World, Universal Studios, Sea World, Busch Gardens, and South Beach. The heavy flow of both winter residents and tourism, along with Florida's growing number of permanent residents, causes the needs of these two judicial districts to be unique in this nation. \\n   In addition, the Middle District contains the federal correctional center at Coleman. When the penitentiary is completed in Spring 2001, this will be one of the largest prison complexes in the country and the largest in the state of Florida. The capacity at Coleman will be approximately 4,700 inmates and all complaints filed by these prisoners regarding the facilities and their individual care will be sent to the Middle District for resolution. \\n   To add to the problem, a portion of the Middle District has been designated a High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area. While I am pleased that Florida will be receiving additional assistance in the war against drugs, we also must recognize that this law enforcement initiative is expected to dramatically impact narcotic related arrests and therefore, prosecutions in the Middle District. \\n   Thus, it is apparent that without the addition of new judges, access to justice will no longer be swift in the Middle and Southern Districts. To provide Floridians with a safe environment and access to justice, a court system must be put in place which can handle the demands of this dynamic and growing part of our country. Accordingly, I urge the Judiciary Committee and the full Senate to consider and pass this legislation expeditiously.  \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990316\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today, along with Senators GRAMS, LIEBERMAN, and KYL, I introduce the Printed Circuit Investment Act of 1999. This bill would allow manufacturers of printed wiring boards and printed wiring assemblies, known as the electronic interconnection industry, to depreciate their production equipment in 3 years rather than the 5 year period under current law. \\n   As we approach the 21st century, our Nation's Tax Code should not stand in the way of technological progress. Printed wiring boards and assemblies are literally central to our economy, as they are the nerve centers of nearly every electronic device from camcorders and televisions to medical devices, computers and defense systems. But the Tax Code places U.S. manufacturers at the disadvantage relative to their Asian competitors, because of different depreciation treatment. This disadvantage is particularly difficult for U.S. firms to bear, as the interconnection industry consists overwhelmingly of small firms that cannot easily absorb the costs inflicted by an irrationally-long depreciated schedule. \\n   As technology continues to advance at light speed, the exhilaration of competition in a dynamic market is dampened by the effects of a tax code that has not kept pace with these changes. Obsolete interconnection manufacturing equipment is kept on the books long after this equipment has gone out the door. Companies with the competitive fire to enter such a rapidly-evolving industry must constantly invest in new state-of-the art equipment, replacing obsolete equipment every 18 to 36 months just to remain competitive. U.S. investments in new printed wiring board and assembly manufacturing equipment have nearly tripled since 1991--growing from $847 million to an estimated $2.4 billion. \\n   But this investment is taxed at an artificially-high rate, because deductions for the cost of the equipment are spread over a period that is several years longer than justified. The industry is at the mercy of tax laws passed in the 1980s, which were based on 1970s-era electronics technology. It is no wonder that the market share of U.S. interconnection companies has been cut in half over this period. Our Tax Code should not continue to undermine the competitiveness of American businesses. The opportunity is before us to correct the tax laws that dictate how rapidly board manufacturers and electronic assemblers can depreciate equipment needed to fabricate and assemble circuit boards. \\n   The Printed Circuit Investment Act of 1999 will provide modest tax relief to the electronics interconnection industry and the 250,000 Americans, residing in every state in the Union, whose jobs rely on the success of this industry. This industry should get fair and accurate tax treatment.  \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990316\\n\\n    Mr. MACK. Mr. President, in an effort to help increase awareness and education about cervical cancer, and to pay tribute to women who have battled the disease, today I am submitting a Senate Resolution to designate the month of January as ``National Cervical Health Month.'' I am pleased that Senator DIANNE FEINSTEIN and 31 bipartisan colleagues in the Senate have agreed to be original co-sponsors of this Senate Resolution. I understand that Representative JUANITA MILLENDER-MCDONALD will be introducing similar legislation in the United States House of Representatives, and I would like to commend her for the leadership she has shown in this important effort. \\n   I would also like to pay tribute to Ms. Carol Ann Armenti, Director of the Center for Cervical Health in Toms River, New Jersey. Ms. Armenti has worked tirelessly on behalf of cervical cancer patients and their families, and she has been a true leader in educating women about this disease. In January, her organization, along with the American Medical Women's Association, launched the National Cervical Cancer Public Education Campaign. The leadership of Ms. Armenti will have a lasting impact upon the lives of women of today, and future generations will be the beneficiaries of her work. \\n   Mr. President, the issue of cervical cancer is one which is deeply personal to my wife, Priscilla, and to me. In 1990, our daughter, Debbie, was diagnosed with cervical cancer. Because of our family history with cancer, Debbie was aware that she had an increased risk of cancer and she made sure to take advantage of early detection screening procedures. Fortunately, her cervical cancer was detected at an early stage, and she was treated successfully with surgery. Not long after her treatment, she have birth to our third grandson. Debbie's experience with cervical cancer exemplifies the fact that early detection saves lives. \\n   According to the American Cancer Society, nearly 1,000 women in Florida will be diagnosed with cervical cancer in 1999. This year, Florida will have the third largest number of new cases of cervical cancer. Yet, despite significant progress being made in the war on cancer, not all segments of the U.S. population have benefitted to the fullest extent from the advances made in the understanding of cancer. According to the U.S. Institute of Medicine report, ``The Unequal Burden of Cancer,'' rates of cervical cancer are significantly higher in Hispanic and African-American women. We simply must reinforce our efforts to eradicate this terrible disease. \\n   Research, education, and early detection are the most effective weapons we have in the war on cervical cancer.  \\n   Research is the key to finding a cure for cervical cancer, and significant progress is being made in this regard. Last month, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) took the rarely-used step of issuing a Clinical Announcement urging physicians to give strong consideration to adding chemotherapy to radiation therapy in the treatment of invasive cervical cancer. According to NCI Director Rick Klausner, this will likely change the standard of treatment for cervical cancer. Dr. Mitchell Morris of the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center called this new treatment approach, ``the first fundamental advance in the treatment of cervical cancer in more than 40 years.'' \\n   I'm also proud to say that several cutting-edge cervical cancer studies are taking place in my home state of Florida. Scientists at the University of Miami Sylvester Cancer Center are studying a new type of cervical cancer immunotherapy. They are developing ``killer cells'' specifically designed to target cancer cells which express human papilloma virus (HPV). By eradicating these cells, the hope is to kill the tumor, even if the cancer has spread. At the H. Lee Moffitt Comprehensive Cancer Center in Tampa, studies are underway to develop a cervical cancer vaccine using some of the same characteristics of the human papilloma virus. They are also examining biomarkers to detect cervical cancer before malignant changes occur. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990311\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, a unilateral statehood declaration by chairman Arafat would constitute a gross violation of the Oslo accords, in effect ending the peace process. And any state that he might declare, outside of the peace process, would be illegitimate, irresponsible, and wrong. \\n   I am pleased to see this initiative has been cosponsored by 90 Senators as of this morning. But we must realize that this show of support grows from a very deep and heartfelt concern. We want peace to succeed, but Chairman Arafat's threat to unilaterally declare a state clearly threatens peace. \\n   Mr. President, last week in a statement on the Senate floor, I asked how can peace be reached while the Palestinian leadership teaches children to hate. Today I ask, how can peace be reached when the Palestinian leadership threatens to unilaterally impose a final status. \\n   I rise today to oppose this threat to the peace process. I hope the President will join us in making this statement to Chairman Arafat. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990310\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today Senator BREAUX and I introduce a bill reaffirming that the lawmaking power is the province of the Congress, not the executive branch. Our bill prohibits the Treasury Department from issuing regulations that would impose taxes on U.S. companies merely because one of their subsidiaries pays money to itself. \\n   As a general rule, U.S. corporations pay U.S. corporate income tax on the earnings of their foreign subsidiaries only when those earnings are actually distributed to the U.S. parent companies. An exception to this general rule is contained in subpart F of the Internal Revenue Code, which accelerates the income tax liability of U.S. parent companies under certain circumstances. The Treasury Department has announced, in Notice 98-35, an intention to issue regulations that will accelerate income tax liability for U.S. companies--not based on the specific circumstances enumerated in subpart F, but instead on a new ``interpretation'' of the ``policies'' that Treasury infers from that 36-year-old provision. This action crosses the line between administering the laws and making the laws, and cannot be allowed by Congress. \\n   Notice 98-35 concerns so-called ``hybrid arrangements.'' These involve business entities that are considered separate corporations for foreign tax purposes, but are viewed as one company with a branch office for U.S. purposes. U.S. companies organize their subsidiaries in this manner to reduce the amount of foreign taxes they owe. Transactions between a subsidiary and its branch have no impact on U.S. taxable income of the parent, as its subsidiary is merely paying money to itself. But the Treasury Department intends to impose a tax on the U.S. parent to penalize it for reducing the foreign taxes it owes. \\n   This effort is wrong for several reasons. First, the Treasury Department possesses only the power to issue regulations to administer the laws passed by Congress. New rules based on Congressional purpose are known as laws, and under the Constitution laws are made by Congress. \\n   Second, the Treasury Department is elevating one policy underlying subpart F--taxing domestic and foreign operations in the same manner--over the other policy of maintaining the competitiveness of U.S. companies in foreign markets. This proposed tax would put U.S.-owned subsidiaries at a competitive disadvantage. \\n   Finally, the Treasury Department should not impose a tax on U.S. companies to force these companies to reorganize in a way that increases the taxes they owe to foreign countries. The Treasury Department is not the tax collector for other nations. And by raising the foreign tax bills of U.S. companies, the Treasury Department is also increasing the size of foreign tax credits and thereby reducing U.S. tax revenues. \\n   The Treasury Department is not only making policy that it has no right to make, it is also making bad policy. Our bill places a moratorium on this lawmaking. It also directs the Treasury  Secretary to study these issues and submit a report to the tax-writing committees of Congress. Many people and organizations, including the Treasury Department, desire changes in the tax laws. But only Congress has the power to make these changes, and this is a power we intend to keep. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990310\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, the Tibetan people are suffering today in the name of freedom, and I am pleased to rise with Senator MOYNIHAN to submit a resolution in solemn commemoration of this day, March 10, in Tibetan history. \\n   It was on March 10, 1959 that the Tibetan people said, ``enough is enough.'' The city of Lhasa organized into what later became known as the ``Lhasa revolt'' on this day forty years ago, to protect their beloved leader, the 14th Dalai Lama, and to reject the impositions of Beijing. Let me provide some details. \\n   The new communist government in Beijing sent an army to invade Tibet in 1949. The People's Liberation Army quickly overwhelmed Tibetan defenses. In 1951, a Tibetan delegation went to Beijing to negotiate a peace agreement. But negotiation is too kind of a word. The Tibetan delegation was forced to sign a PRC-written document known as the ``17 Point Agreement.'' Even though it was forced upon the Tibetan government, it promised to preserve Tibetan political, cultural, and religious institutions, and so was warily accepted by the Tibetan government. \\n   Mr. President, going back to the early days of the PRC, we can see a pattern. The terms on paper protected the Tibetan way of life. But the promises proved empty. I suggest this is a lesson our President today would be wise to learn. Whether regarding Hong Kong, weapons proliferation, or trade, we must remember what Ronald Reagan taught us--``trust, but verify.'' This is especially true of our dealings with communists and authoritarian rulers. \\n   In Tibet, nine years of trying to compromise with the communists, from 1951 to 1959, failed. In fact, the restrictions on Tibet increased progressively, as did the oppression and brutality of Beijing's rule. \\n   March 10, 1959 stands out as an important day, not only in Tibet's history, but also in the history of humanity's struggle for freedom. On this day, the people of Lhasa organized a permanent guard around the Dalai Lama's palace, and demanded the withdrawal of the Chinese from Tibet and the restoration of Tibet's independence. \\n   One week later, the Dalai Lama was forced to flee his home and his people while his palace was being shelled by the PLA. It is important to note that, in a great and triumphant official act, he repudiated the 17-Point agreement. \\n   According to Chinese statistics, 87,000 Tibetans were killed, arrested, or deported to labor camps during this ``Lhasa Revolt.'' Countless tried to follow the Dalai Lama to India--unfortunately, only a very small percentage of the thousands who attempted to escape through the Himalayas to India survived. If they could successfully avoid the Chinese military--then they would succumb to malnutrition, cold, and disease. \\n   Mr. President, we are today honoring the memory of the more than 87,000 Tibetans who paid with their lives for the preservation of Tibet. We also honor the 6 million Tibetans today who keep alive the hope of one-day returning home. \\n   Mr. President, we believe in certain inalienable rights; it is part of our constitution. I believe that our freedom cannot be complete, and we as a nation cannot achieve our fullest greatness, so long as others suffer from the yoke of tyranny and oppression. Tibet today suffers from cultural genocide at the hands of the PRC. And yet, don't they also have inalienable rights: to reject tyranny? to determine their political future including independence? to chose freedom and reject oppression? \\n   The answer, very clearly, must be a resounding ``yes.'' We have introduced  this resolution today, to register this ``yes.'' We do it for His Holiness, the Dalai Lama of Tibet. We do it for the 6 million Tibetans in the world today facing the very real and unfortunate threat of seeing their homeland destroyed and culture obliterated. And, we do it for each of us who believe that the gifts we have in our lives here do not excuse us from caring about the struggles of others. \\n   I am pleased to submit this resolution, and ask my colleagues to support its immediate adoption. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990309\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I thank the Senator for yielding. I will not use that much time. I thank the Senator for the leadership he has provided on this legislation. \\n   It was really not my intention to speak on this bill because I was under the impression that this bill had great bipartisan support, that we would bring this to the floor after coming out of committee, and it would breeze through the Senate. This is a piece of legislation that is supposedly--supposedly--supported by everybody. \\n   I am pleased to speak in favor of the Ed-Flex bill. Our children will thrive when State and local communities are given the freedom to craft their education plans according to the unique education needs of their children. Local schools do more when Washington bureaucracies do less. That is what this bill does. \\n   We are beginning the second week of consideration of this bill. We have been forced to file three cloture motions on what may be the most popular, most bipartisan legislation we will consider this Congress. \\n   I fear this may set the tone for the remainder of the 106th Congress, where consideration of any bill will be filibustered by the Democrats and drive partisanship to new heights. \\n   As I implied a moment ago, I am in some ways confused by what is happening. I do not understand how a bill that supposedly is supported by an overwhelming number of Members on both sides of the aisle has been caught up in this constant and continuous effort to amend the bill. \\n   I think the actions we have seen during this past week, and what we are anticipating through the balance of this week, raise the question about those who have cosponsored the bill and who say they are in support of it. I question whether they truly support the idea of Ed-Flex, which is to allow State and local communities to have more control over how dollars are spent. I think there is a ruse underway here. I think our colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to claim that they support the idea of giving local communities  and States more authority and more flexibility in how to spend their dollars, yet they come out here and offer amendment after amendment on this bill, knowing full well--and I ask the Senator from Tennessee if this is not the case--knowing full well the majority leader has said to them there will be other opportunities to offer these amendments on other education bills when they come forward. Is that an accurate statement? \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-19990309\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. As I said a minute ago, I really am serious now in raising questions about the sincerity of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle who purport that they are in favor of Ed-Flex but, yet, want to bog this piece of legislation down with a whole series of amendments they know are controversial. \\n   There is nothing wrong with us dealing with controversial amendments and controversial issues. We do that throughout our entire political careers. The question is the timing of it. The question is the approach. I am, again, dismayed by the attitude that is being projected here. I, again, question sincerity. \\n   Recently, we went through a 5- or 6-week period at the beginning of this new Congress with a very contentious issue dealing with the impeachment trial. But each side made a sincere effort to work with the other, and as a result I think we did a credible job. I think most people in the country think we did a credible job. Yet, on this the second piece of legislation we are considering, we are being forced to offer cloture motion after cloture motion after cloture motion--three so far. There should be no question in anyone's mind that the intention here, I believe, is now to kill this piece of legislation because it goes against their political interests. It goes against their philosophy. \\n   In all honesty, the differences in the approach about education in America is clear. Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are convinced the only way to improve education in America is to have a larger group of wiser bureaucrats in \\n   Washington make a determination about how resources ought to be allocated and what regulations ought to come down from Washington in order to solve this problem. \\n   We have a totally different view. We think if we give this money to the States and the local communities, they can make better decisions about what their top spending priority is. In some local school districts that is school buildings. In other school districts that is school books. In others, that is teachers. We ought to allow them to make those decisions. We should not stand in their way. \\n   Again, I came here to raise these points with respect to the process, as much as anything else. I remind everyone that, in the last Congress, there were 69 cloture motions that were filed--69 cloture motions. And here we are again battling along party lines about a bill that we were told might pass with 100 votes. I have serious reservations now whether that is going to happen. I think the actions of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are very clear. They are now trying to kill the idea of allowing States and local communities to have more flexibility. \\n   Again, I appreciate the work and the effort of the Senator from Tennessee on this issue. He has provided great leadership and I appreciate the opportunity and the time he has given me. \\n   With that, I yield the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990308\\n\\n    Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for Senate Resolution 57 condemning the Cuban government's human rights record and calling on the President to make all efforts necessary to pass a resolution condemning Cuba at the UN Human Rights Commission meeting in Geneva, Switzerland. \\n   Many people have written and spoken about the latest crackdown in Cuba as if they were discovering for the first time the nature of Fidel Castro's brutal regime. Fidel Castro is a tyrant. He rules with absolute authority and uses fear and greed to maintain his power. For forty years he has demonstrated to us his nature. He has not changed. We must continue our pressure on him--voice our opposition to him. And we must continue our support for the struggling Cuban people. The choice should not be difficult to make: we must stand with those suffering under one of the few totalitarian Marxists remaining in power in the world, and we must stand up to condemn the actions of the brutal regime. \\n   One clear reminder of who we are dealing with is the murder in the Florida straits of four Americans in 1996. They were flying a humanitarian mission when the Cuban Air Force shot their unarmed aircraft out of the sky. For three years, Mr. President, we have all known about this murder, and for three years, I have been struggling to understand why this administration refuses to take appropriate action. \\n   The Boston Globe published a very powerful essay by columnist Jeff Jacoby to mark this anniversary. I'd like to read from it. Jeff captures the starkness of the mismatched foreign policy in place, comparing the act, which Fidel Castro committed with this administration's unprincipled response. His piece is titled ``Murder Over the High Seas.''  \\n   They were trying to save lives. Three years ago this week, they paid with their own. \\n   When Armando Alejandre, Carlos Costa, Mario de la Pena, and Pablo Morales took to the skies that day in their little blue-and-white Cessna 337s, their plan was to search the Florida Straits for stranded boat people, refugees fleeing Cuba in makeshift rafts or flimsy inner tubes. There was little enough the fliers could do for any rafters they came upon--toss down food and bottled water, radio their location to the Coast Guard--but that little could make the difference between life and death. \\n   Of the four, Carlos was the most experienced. He had flown more than 500 such missions for Brothers to the Rescue, and had saved scores of boat people from drowning or dying of thirst. Armando, by contrast, was going up for only the second time. What all four had in common was a love of American liberty--and a profound concern for any Cubans so desperate to escape Fidel Castro's Caribbean hellspot that they would risk their lives to get away. \\n   On Feb. 24, 1996, Carlos, Armando, Mario, and Pablo took off from an airfield in Opa-Locka, Fla. They intended to fly just below the 24th parallel, well north of Cuba's territorial waters. Both planes contacted Havana air-traffic controllers as they approached the 24th parallel, identifying themselves and giving their position. Whereupon the Cuban Air Force, without warning and without reason, scrambled two MiG fighters and blew the rescue planes out of the sky. \\n   The Cessnas and their passengers were disintegrated by the Cuban MiGs. Only a large oil slick marked the spot where they went down. No bodies were ever recovered. \\n   Three of the men--Carlos, Mario, and Armando--were US citizens. Pablo, a former refugee who had himself been saved by Brothers to the Rescue in 1992, was a permanent US resident. What happens when four American civilians are butchered in cold blood, over international waters, by the air force of a Third World dictatorship? What terrible retribution does the United States exact for a quadruple murder so barbaric and unprovoked? \\n   The astonishing answer is: Nothing happens. There is no retribution. Indeed, the Clinton administration takes the position not only that Castro must not be punished for the four lives he destroyed, but that the victims' families must not be permitted to recover anything for their loss. \\n   In the wake of the shootdown, under intense political pressure, President Clinton agreed to sign the Helms-Burton Act. Title III of the statute allows American citizens whose property was confiscated by the Cuban government--Castro nationalized billions of dollars' worth of American assets in the 1960s--to file suit against any foreign company using that property. Title IV bars any officer of a foreign company trafficking in stolen American property from receiving a visa to enter the United States. \\n   Properly enforced, Helms-Burton would weaken Castro's grip on power by reducing the flow of foreign capital into his treasury. But Helms-Burton is not properly enforced. Title III has never taken effect because Clinton keeps suspending it (as the law permits him to do if he finds that a suspension ``will expedite a transition to democracy in Cuba''). Title IV has never taken effect because the State Department refuses to carry it out. \\n   The hobbling of Helms-Burton is a stinging insult to the memory of the four murdered men. But the Clinton administration has delivered a cut unkinder still. \\n   In 1996, the families of Armando, Carlos, and Mario sued the Cuban government for damages caused by the wrongful deaths of their loved ones, a legal remedy specifically authorized by the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act. In December 1997, Senior US District Judge James Lawrence King awarded the plaintiffs $187.7 million in damages. ``Cuba's extrajudicial killings ..... were inhumane acts against innocent civilians,'' he wrote in his final judgment. ``The fact that the killings were premeditated and intentional, outside Cuban territory, wholly  disproportionate, and executed without warning ..... makes this act unique in its brazen flouting of international norms.'' \\n   But when the families attempted to collect their judgment out of frozen Cuban assets, the Clinton administration blocked them. The president famous for feeling people's pain is less concerned with the pain of grief-stricken Americans, it would appear, than with the pain Castro might feel if the judgment were paid. \\n   The administration's position is staggering. Castro is an open and declared enemy of the United States and has been for 40 years. In sending combat aircraft to slaughter four unarmed Americans engaged in humanitarian rescue work, he committed an act of war. The response of the United States should have been to remove Castro from power and put him in the dock for crimes against humanity. (for the murder of just ``one'' American in 1989, the United States invaded Panama and seized Manuel Noriega.) \\n   Clinton's appeasement of Castro is a cruel betrayal. The families of the dead Brothers of the Rescue deserve better from their government. And the tormented people of Cuba, bleeding under Castro's whip, deserve better from their free and powerful neighbor to the north.  \\n   Mr. President, it is clear to me that the United States has failed to stand up for the protection of the individual when damaged by international terrorism. I spoke last week about this administration's failure to adequately address terrorism in the Middle East. The pattern remains consistent--appease the enemies of freedom, the advocates of terror, in the hopes that they will not strike again. This approach simply fails. I don't know how to say it any more directly that that. This approach fails. \\n   The Congress passed a law last year supporting the awarding of damages from the frozen assets of terrorist states being held by the Treasury Department to American victims. This law can help the families of the Brothers to the Rescue pilots. The President, however, waived this relief asserting our national security interests would be better served by protecting Castro's money. How can this be? Nobody has provided to me an adequate explanation of what interest would cause us protect terrorism and shun American victims. \\n   Mr. President, this resolution calls on the United States to stand up for freedom, justice, and human dignity. It states that the President of the United States should lead on this issue by having the United States introduce and make all efforts necessary to pass a resolution in Geneva condemning the human rights record of the Cuban government. Mr. President, if there is one time and one place where we are obliged to condemn human rights practices, it is at the UN Commission meeting in Geneva each year. That is what this resolution calls for, and I calls for its immediate passage.  \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990304\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to join with my distinguished colleagues, Senators CHAFEE, LIEBERMAN, and others, in introducing the Credit for Voluntary Early Action Act. This measure is an important first step towards reducing the regulatory uncertainty surrounding any possible regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. This bill will provided us a valuable platform for a thorough discussion of this important issue and I encourage all my colleagues to join us in our efforts. \\n   In my state of Florida, we learned long ago that a healthy environment is fundamentally necessary for a healthy economy. This is evidenced by our congressional delegation's historic bipartisan consensus on such important national issues as the protection of the Florida Everglades and our efforts to stop oil and gas exploration off our beaches. The citizens of my state know full well how necessary it is we keep our environment clean and pristine. \\n   I'm proud to stand with my colleagues here today and take Florida's common sense, market-based attitude on the environment to the national level. The legislation we're sponsoring today would encourage and reward voluntary actions businesses take to reduce the emission of potentially harmful greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide. \\n   Under our bill, the President would be authorized to provide regulatory credit to companies who take early voluntary action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This credit could be used to comply with future regulatory  requirements and--in a market-based approach--traded or sold to other companies as they work to meet their own environmental obligations. \\n   Participants in this innovative program would agree to annually measure, track and publicly report greenhouse gas emissions. Credit given would be one-for-one, based on actual reductions below an agreed-upon baseline. Credits issued under the program would be subtracted from total emissions allowed under future regulatory emissions requirements. \\n   I believe this approach makes sense for many reasons. For one, there are many uncertainties surrounding the issue of greenhouse gas emissions and their relation to global warming. The complexities and uncertainties associated with understanding the interactions of our climate, our atmosphere and the impact of human behavior are enormous. I have my own concerns about the science behind this issue, and have tremendous concerns about the regulatory approach outlined in last year's Kyoto agreement. It is not my intent--in cosponsoring this bill--to validate Kyoto or the underlying science. Those issues are best left to the scientists and future congresses. Today, we are simply trying to clear the way for voluntary emissions-reductions projects that would otherwise be delayed for years. And we accomplish this in a way that is not costly to the taxpayers. \\n   It makes sense to provide appropriate encouragement to businesses who want to invest in improved efficiency--those who want to find ways to make cars, factories and power production cleaner. Under our bill, these companies are encouraged--not based on government fiat or handout--to get credit for their own initiative and problem solving skills. \\n   Another reason I believe this legislation would be beneficial is because today's businesses have no control over the regulations that could be required of them down the road. Although today's Congress has no desire to legislate requirements on greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, it is extremely difficult to predict where the scientific and economic data will carry future policymakers. In my view, it makes sense to encourage businesses to be proactive in protecting themselves from any future restrictions enacted by a more regulatory-minded Congress and administration. \\n   Mr. President, all of us agree that a healthy environment is important to our future. It's time to put partisanship aside and solve our environmental problem in a way that will allow business to be in control of their own future while doing their part to address global warming. By allowing companies to earn credit for actions they take now, businesses can be prepared for any regulations in the future. \\n   I look forward to beginning an earnest debate about this issue with my colleagues in the United States Senate. I believe we have an innovative approach to confronting as issue fraught with uncertainties. We should be looking to solve more of our problems by using our free market philosophy rather than by costly Washington mandates that my not work. The Credit for Voluntary Early Reductions Act is responsible effort to validate on the national level what we've always known in Florida: a healthy environment is key to a healthy economy. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990303\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-19990303\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I understand we are in morning business. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-3-19990303\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I ask unanimous consent to speak in morning business for not to exceed 30 minutes. I hope I will not use the full 30 minutes. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990303\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I very recently traveled to Israel. It had been several years since my last visit, and I expected this year we would bring some  important measures to the Senate floor. The timeline on the Oslo accords expires in May, and Arafat has threatened to unilaterally declare an independent state. The supplemental appropriations for the Wye River accords will soon be before us, and the timetable on the Jerusalem Embassy Act requires that the President report to the Congress why the United States Embassy has not been set up in Israel's capital city, Jerusalem. I learned a great deal during the week and I rise today to share a few simple thoughts regarding what I saw and what went through my mind as the week in Israel unfolded. \\n   Let me begin with the question that is on my mind today: How is it possible to engage in peace negotiations with people who maintain the right to obliterate you, who are filled with hatred toward you, and who harbor the dream of one day destroying your homeland? Peace is a matter of the heart. I believe in the depths of every person's heart is a desire to live in peace. But what I saw, which was the outcome of the Palestinian Authority rule, convinced me that their hearts and minds are set on other goals. The Palestinian leadership does not want peace. They want, first, their own state which they can control with total power. Then they want to use that state to eliminate the State of Israel. \\n   Let's be clear. The peace process, to be meaningful, must be about more than rules and laws and lines on a map. We can reach a short-term agreement on these points, but if the Palestinian leadership fails to abandon incitement of hatred, persecution, and terrorism, then we are all dreaming, only dreaming, and our President's behavior must be labeled foolish appeasement. There will not be peace until hearts and minds are changed, and we must focus our attention on these issues. \\n   Mr. President, many of my colleagues in the Senate and in the House are aware of the promotion of hatred contained in the Palestinian media, and more significantly in the Palestinian schoolbooks. Let me provide some examples. \\n   This is a picture that was taken off of Palestinian Authority-controlled television. It is a picture of a young girl, probably 6 or 7 years old. This is a young girl singing into a microphone. She is on a television show that would be what we would refer to as kind of a Mickey Mouse Club type of show that would be shown to children by the Palestinian Authority. I want to read to you what this little girl is singing. Again, this is a program that was produced by the people who are sitting across the table from you, supposedly negotiating peace. This is what the little girl is singing:  \\n   When I wander into the entrance of Jerusalem, \\n   I'll turn into a suicide warrior in battledress, \\n   In battledress. In battledress.  \\n   There is no way I can convey to you the emotion of actually seeing that scene on television. There is no way I can put the emotion into what she was expressing and the emotion that she was expressing as she sang those words. And after her song, she got an ovation from her classmates and from her teacher. \\n   This focuses us on the fundamental difference in approach between the Palestinians and the Israelis. I have a grandson about that age, about the age of that little girl. How would I feel if he were being taught hatred in school? If he were being taught hatred on television, how would I feel? How would you feel if your Government was teaching your children to hate? Could you conclude that they were serious about long-term peace with their neighbors? \\n   I also have some examples from Palestinian textbooks for a third-grade grammar lesson. Here is the task: ``Complete the following blank spaces with the appropriate word.'' And the sentence is, ``The Zionist enemy blank civilians with its aircraft.'' The correct answer is, ``The Zionist enemy attacked civilians with its aircraft.'' \\n   For seventh graders: ``Answer the following question: Why do the Jews hate Muslim unity and want to cause division among them? Give an example of the evil attempts of the Jews, from events happening today.'' These are from Palestinian textbooks today. \\n   One would expect, rather than focus on hatred, if they were serious about peace, they would focus on how the two peoples are working to live side by side. A history book for 12th graders published only last summer teaches: ``The clearest examples of racist belief and racial discrimination in the world are Nazism and Zionism.'' \\n   To see this taking place today is chilling. If you can, think about it in the context of being in Israel and being briefed by a member of the Government with respect to what is happening in what they refer to as the anti-incitement committee, which was set up by the Wye Agreement. To be sitting there and seeing this, I must say to you, was chilling. I found it to be extremely chilling. \\n   While the Government of Israel makes good-faith efforts to come to a peace agreement, the Palestinian Authority teaches children hatred. This causes me to ask, How can peace be obtained when the children are being taught hatred? \\n   Let me share another story. I attended Shabbat dinner at the home of Saul and Wendy Singer in Jerusalem. Saul worked on my staff for 7 years before moving with his wife to Israel. They just had their second child, a girl named Tamar. Wendy told the story of the day she was checking out of the hospital in Jerusalem, 2 days after giving birth. In a very ordinary and matter of fact way, the hospital gave her the necessities for bringing home a newborn baby. In addition to providing for diapers and other things we would expect, she was handed a gas mask for her baby. It is actually a tent which you put your baby under in case of a chemical weapons attack. \\n   In Israel, this preparation is routine. Everyone in Israel knows to have a gas mask ready. It just becomes a part of the craziness of everyday life. But when you bring home a newborn baby, when you bring home your baby and you get the chemical weapons tent at the hospital, then you realize how unordinary life is in Israel today. You realize that you are really simply struggling for a normal life, hoping for peace and security, praying to God, while actually living in a war zone. \\n   I had another profound meeting during this week. I met one evening privately--secretly--with Arabs who were being persecuted for their Christian faith. I met with about 10 Palestinian Christians. I will tell you just one of their stories, but I will change some of the details to protect the person I am describing. \\n   I remember an energetic man, in his early 40s, at the end of the table. I remember him because he seemed so full of life and love. He had a great smile on his face and displayed a wonderful sense of humor. I say this was memorable because, frankly, after hearing what he had been through, I do not know if I could express the sense of peace and love he did. This is his story. \\n   He had many children and very little money. He converted to Christianity in 1993. He clearly loved God, and he loved to tell people about his conversion. He described to me how in 1997, the Palestinian Authority asked him to come to the police station for questioning. When he arrived, he was immediately arrested and detained on charges of selling land to Jews. He denied this charge, since he was very poor and owned no land. He was beaten. He was hung from the ceiling by his hands for many hours. He showed me what I just said. He showed me how his hands were tied behind his back and then raised from the floor and hung that way for many, many hours. \\n   After 2 weeks, he was transferred to a larger prison where he was held for 8 months without trial. He was released in February 1998, after his family borrowed thousands of dollars to pay off the local authorities. And even though he is free, they are keeping his father in prison. They believe it is for his son's beliefs. He feels his father is being held hostage to prevent him from talking with people about his faith. Needless to say, these Christians met with me at considerable risk. They conveyed to me a message of fear and desperation. But their mere presence in the room with me demonstrated their hope, and it also caused me to ask, how can the people of Israel find peace with the Palestinian Authority while the Palestinian Authority engages in coercion and torture based upon religious beliefs? \\n   I also met with the parents of American children killed by Palestinian terrorists. In this meeting, I was struck by the courage displayed by these families after suffering the tremendous loss  of a child brutally murdered. These families told me of the hopes and dreams they had for their children. I couldn't help thinking about my own. My daughter, Debbie, traveled with me on this trip. She was in the room as these stories of brutality and murder were related. There was scarcely a dry eye in the room. \\n   I am sure Debbie was thinking about her three little boys, ages 14, 11 and 5. We were moved by the comments made by the parents as they described to us what had happened. \\n   I understand that the Palestinian Authority knows a great deal about these murderers, but they are not being punished. Some of them have gone to trial and were sentenced, but we don't know if they remain in prison. I was told that we know some have been released. \\n   There are reports that the Palestinian Authority allows them to leave prison each day and return in the evening--like free room and board more than like prison. I was also presented with stories of the lionization of these murderers in the press and again in the classrooms. Try to imagine how you would feel, try to imagine what would be going through your mind when you are dealing with the grief of the loss of your child. You know who is responsible. You know they know who is responsible. You saw them go on trial. You saw them then released. You have to ask yourself, what are we going through this peace process for? \\n   I would like to mention one story of many that I heard. Mrs. Dosberg sat directly across the table from me. When she told us of the loss of her daughter and son-in-law, the lesson of these murders became so clear--we must fight terror and we cannot back off. Mrs. Dosberg's family, her daughter, American son-in-law, and their 9-month-old daughter attended a wedding in central Israel on June 9, 1996. They decided not to bring their 2-year-old daughter along. Thank God. On the way home from the wedding they were stopped by Palestinian terrorists and killed in a so-called drive-by shooting. Fifty bullets were found to have been used in this murder, and yet, by some miracle, the baby survived. Even with a crime this gross, the Palestinian Authority did not arrest \\n   everyone involved or suspected in the shooting. One of those who remained free, it is believed, later took part in the bombing of the Apropos Cafe, killing many others. \\n   Another suspected killer, according to the Israeli Justice Ministry, was under arrest but given permission to come and go as he pleases from prison. \\n   Mohammed Dief, another suspected Palestinian terrorist, took part in the murder of two other Americans, at two different times, according to the mothers with whom I spoke. Mrs. Sharon Weinstock lost her 19-year-old son in a drive-by shooting masterminded by Dief. And only a year later, Mrs. Wachsman told me of the kidnap-murder of their son, also believed to have been planned by Dief. \\n   I am told Mohammed Dief remains a free man today. The obvious lesson--terrorists kill and those who are not jailed remain free to kill and to kill again thanks to the Palestinian Authority. \\n   How would I feel in their place? I couldn't keep the thought from my mind, as I listened. If I had lost a child and knew that the murderer or accomplices were on the loose, how would I feel? And if I knew the killer remained free to kill other people's children, how would I feel? It is so hard, hard to even consider, but I do know that I left there committed to doing whatever I could to help each of those families. \\n   Once again, I began to better understand the way the Palestinian Authority leadership was approaching peace. How can one find peace with people who do not condemn terrorism? Mr. President, how is it possible to engage in peace negotiations with people who want to teach their children to die in a holy war against you? How is it possible to engage in peace negotiations with people who persecute those of other faiths? How is it possible to engage in peace negotiations with people who keep terrorists on the loose to wreak havoc and evil against you and praise them for heroism? \\n   Today the Israeli people are exhausted by 50 years of violence against their homes and families, of sending their sons and daughters into the army, and they dream of a promised peace now. This is our hope and our dream as well. But we must not get confused. History is replete with examples of compromises which bring terror and destroy dreams. \\n   In the United States, many people seem to think that if we do not confront these obstacles to peace and if we look the other way, then we will be able to come to an agreement. The reality, however, is just the opposite. If we do not acknowledge the attitudes and acts of those at the peace table, then the peace process is already over, and we just won't admit it. \\n   In other words, the surest way to kill the peace process is to avoid confrontation, to fear upsetting a belligerent force and to avoid addressing incitement, violence, persecution and terrorism. The only way to keep the peace process alive is to focus on truth, freedom, security and justice. \\n   Israeli efforts, to date, have sought to keep the peace process alive, improve security during the negotiating process, and obtain reciprocity as a vital element of implementation. \\n   The process remains alive, but terrorism continues and is exalted by many in the Palestinian Authority, and reciprocity does not exist. The United States role has been to seek the middle ground. Unfortunately, this only rewards those willing to go to new extremes. \\n   The middle ground between Prime Minister Netanyahu and Chairman Arafat is not halfway between the two. The United States must not engage in moral equivocation. We must not shy away from holding Arafat responsible for acts of violence, incitement and persecution. \\n   The United States must demonstrate principled leadership and end the appeasement that perpetuates the cycle of violence. The peace process can only work when leaders uphold their agreements and answer to the people, and the United States remains a vigilant defender of the principles which bind us to Israel: freedom, democracy, and the rule of law. \\n   What should we do? I believe there are three things. First, we should insist upon the strict adherence to Oslo and the reciprocity codified at Wye. The purpose of the Wye accord was at long last to force the Palestinians to comply with commitments before further territory would be turned over. \\n   So at Wye, Israel agreed only to turn over territory in phases, in which it could verify Palestinian compliance at each and every step. In the first phase, Israel completed its redeployment after the Palestinian Authority completed its tasks. In phase 2, the Palestinians did not meet all their obligations and, therefore, Israel has not yet turned over the additional land. Reciprocity makes no sense unless it is based upon this formulation. Once Israel has ceded territory, it is unlikely it ever could recover it. The Palestinians, on the other hand, can turn on and off their promises. In fact, this is exactly what they have done. \\n   Second, we should stop paying Arafat. Any funds provided to the Palestinian people should continue to go through private voluntary organizations. We should also monitor much more closely the rampant corruption and mismanagement of funds provided currently. \\n   And third, we must aggressively seek the bringing to justice of Palestinian terrorists who killed American citizens. I am told that our Justice Department can do a better job here, that they have a great deal of information on the murderers of the Americans who are free in the Palestinian areas and, indeed, can make some requests for indictments. It is time to do this. Let's put the needs of the American families and other victims' families over the needs of those engaging in or supporting terrorism. \\n   Mr. President, these are very basic principles. I am not discussing today the intricacies of the peace process, U.S. funding, embassies, or any other number of issues we will be discussing this year in the Senate. We need to focus on a more fundamental level first. And I hope that this message will be heard at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. \\n   What I mean when I say this is that I hope the President will hear the message. I say this from a standpoint not of arrogance, not of confrontation, and I do not mean it in a political way. I just hope that the President will listen  and take another look at what he and his foreign policy team are trying to force the Israeli Government to do. \\n   There cannot be peace until there is a change of heart. I returned from this trip with a newfound concern for the future of Israel. I saw examples of incitement. I heard examples of persecution and hatred being taught throughout Palestinian society by their leaders. When the people engaged in peace talks return from the negotiating table only to disparage compromise and incite violence, there can be no progress towards peace. \\n   Israel has come a long way since I first began following the fate of this state and the people of Israel. In so many respects, life appears and feels normal. The economy is developing, the standard of living is growing and improving. But just below the surface of this normalcy, Mr. President, Israel still faces a threat to the state's very existence. Israel's survival remains, unfortunately, a very real and central concern 50 years after its independence. \\n   Some people believe, however, that by ignoring this threat, that the peace process can succeed. Mr. President, it will fail. It is clear to me that many in the Palestinian leadership today see the peace process toward the goal of eliminating the State of Israel. \\n   I suggest today that we get back to the basics. Peace is not possible while teaching children to hate and kill. Peace is not possible while persecuting those of other faiths. Peace is not possible while lionizing terrorism. We must stand up for freedom, security, and human dignity. We must stand up to ensure the security of Israel. We must stand up in the Congress, and we must insist that our President stand with us. \\n   Today is the day to end American pressure on Israel to force a peace agreement. Today is the day to remember it is up to the people of Israel to determine their own fate--their own security. We should pressure those who fill children with slogans of hatred and holy war; we should pressure them to change. We should pressure those who torture; we should pressure them to change. We should pressure those who encourage and support terror and murder, and those who rejoice in hatred. That is where the pressure should be. \\n   Now is the time, Mr. President, for a return to our principled stand. The only way to truly attain peace is to support freedom, democracy and justice, and oppose the cycle of hatred. We must face tyranny and oppression where it exists, condemn it, and stand up for peace--real peace based upon security, freedom, and a change of heart. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990303\\n\\n   Mr. MACK.

Mr. President, if there is ever a time and place to raise human rights concerns, it is at the annual meeting of the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva, Switzerland. That Commission is meeting right now. And I rise today to urge my fellow Senators to join with me and the 17 other cosponsors of this resolution to make a simple statement. We disapprove of the human rights abuses occurring in China and in Tibet. \\n   Since last year, when we passed this resolution with 95 votes, the President has engaged in two summits with Chinese President Jiang. During that time, many promises were made and agreements were concluded, and the United States did not introduce a human rights resolution in Geneva. \\n   We were told the United States would make progress by not introducing a resolution. And Wei Jingsheng, a prominent dissident, was released. Tomorrow, Mr. Wei will be here in Washington, DC, and he will urge the United States not to make the same mistake as last year. Mr. President, we must now make this statement of condemnation of China's human rights practices. \\n   We received many promises from the Chinese Government last year as well. But we know that the human rights conditions have only deteriorated. The State Department's human rights report clearly delineates the atrocities occurring in China and Tibet. And we know from press accounts that the crackdown on human rights and political activists has hardened. \\n   It is unconscionable that the United States would not take a stand against these blatant atrocities, especially when they are documented by our own State Department. By remaining \\n   silent, we do a great injustice to those fighting for freedom, democracy, and the rule of law inside China and Tibet. \\n   Mr. President, I want to quote from a statement made by Mr. Wei not long after he was released and exiled from his country. And this is what he said:  \\n   Democracy and freedom are among the loftiest ideals of humanity, and they are the most sacred rights of mankind. Those who already enjoy democracy, liberty and human rights, in particular, should not allow their own personal happiness to numb them into forgetting the many others who are still struggling against tyranny, slavery and poverty, and all of those who are suffering from unimaginable forms of oppression, exploitation and massacres.  \\n   Mr. President, this is an easy one. It does not matter whether the world votes with us or against us or abstains in Geneva. It does not even matter if this resolution will change the minds of anyone in Beijing. We do know, however, from the firsthand testimony of released dissidents, that the actions of the United States are important to those engaged in the struggle for freedom. We know from those released that by simply making this statement we demonstrate our solidarity with those who are engaged within the daily struggle for freedom, justice, and the respect for human dignity. \\n   I hope my colleagues will join me in calling for this expression of solidarity--this stand for freedom. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990212\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. Chief Justice, today the Senate finds itself at an unlikely crossroads in American history. We have assembled as a court of impeachment to sit in judgement of our President, William Jefferson Clinton, on the charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. We have worked our will in this matter according to a process rooted in English common law, written by our Founders into the Constitution, and exercised against the Chief Executive only once before in American history. \\n   This is not a task to be taken lightly, and we have not arrived easily at our decision. The Senate today is engaged in weighty struggles that go to the very heart of our private and public lives. We are at an unlikely juncture between principle and public opinion, repentance and the rule of law, perception and punishment, forgiveness and findings of fact. These are difficult issues, Mr. Chief Justice. We approach our task fully aware that our decisions today will reverberate across this great land and throughout the length and breadth of history. \\n   There has been much discussion about how we got here. And while the answer to that question may be varied in all its permutations, then amplified in the echo-chamber that is our modern public debate, it can be said with assurance that this whole unseemly business began when the President, caught in an improper private act, took deliberate steps to conceal it. And for all the other parties blamed for our presence here today--the media, the independent counsel, the political factions opposed to the President, the House of Representatives--it must be clearly understood that this process began with the deliberate and wilful acts of the President of the United States to lie in a Supreme Court sanctioned civil rights inquiry and obstruct the due course of justice. It all started with the high-handed disregard for the law exhibited by the nation's Chief Executive. It ends today. \\n   Mr. Chief Justice, when the sound and fury of the moment has passed, and this episode can be observed with the objectivity that comes with the passage of time, I believe it will be self-evident that we have followed the Constitution to the best of our abilities. In a free, democratic society such as ours, the foundation of freedom is an independent judiciary, the rule of law, and most importantly the Constitution. Our Constitution is the framework for American society, and I have been constantly reminded throughout these proceedings of the importance of our duty to honor the dignity of this document. \\n   The magnitude of this undertaking deserves no less than a sincerity of purpose and an absolute confidence in the wisdom of our Founders. The American people should not be swayed by those who argue the prominence of this case--in all its tawdry and unseemly detail--has made unnecessary a thorough process of determining the truth. We stand in judgement of the President. Our decisions will be remembered throughout history. Our precedent may be followed by future Senates. Yet, still we have heard throughout this exercise the unfortunate call to end these proceedings, save a few weeks, and inject the politics of expediency into a monumental Constitutional undertaking. I find these arguments display a remarkable lack of confidence in the  sound and just system outlined by our Founders to address very serious charges levied against the President of the United States. \\n   I am grateful the Senate rejected those calls and put in place a responsible mechanism for the thorough airing of fact and argument. I am confident our process during this trial, though far from perfect, was appropriate. We allowed time for detailed presentations on the part of the House of Representatives and the President. We held an extensive question-and-answer session to review and clarify matters presented by both sides. And we have allowed for the appropriate and necessary deposition of key witnesses. Unfortunately, the simple fact is that the outcome of this matter was, in many minds, predetermined. In spite of this, the integrity of the process was, time and again, fought for and protected. Now--today-- it only remains for us to cast our votes. \\n   BACKGROUND \\n   I wish to address my remarks not so much to the people listening in this room today, but rather to those future generations who will look back at the record and transcripts for guidance, direction, and a more thorough understanding of the process that played out in this chamber during the first two months of 1999. I mentioned earlier the significance of the Constitution. I cannot stress enough the essential role that this historical document has played in the trial of William Jefferson Clinton. This document laid the framework for what has taken place. Be it understood, the Senate tried the President because the Constitution requires that we do so. There is no exception for popular Presidents, such as William Jefferson Clinton. The Constitution provides for this process to be applied to everyone evenhandedly. \\n   Although the trial of this President was not a trial in the traditional sense, it is important to note that if the impeachment of a President presents itself again, there is nothing restricting a more traditional trial from occurring. In fact, I would encourage future Senates to utilize a judicial proceeding more closely aligned to a typical courtroom trial. Every impeachment trial will have its own dynamic environment, determined by the political and social context in which it occurs. The \\n   trial of William Jefferson Clinton occurred in a prosperous time. The citizens of this nation are largely satisfied, the President enjoys consistently high approval ratings, and the economy is outstanding. Impeaching and then trying the President has not engendered popular public support. I make these observations for future generations who reflect on this process simply to explain the mood of our nation and the political environment in which this proceeding occurred. As a result, we should not deceive ourselves into believing that public opinion did not impact this process. I would like to believe, however, that the competing demands of expediting the process versus honoring our Constitutional duties created a struggle that produced the most fair trial possible under the circumstances. Accordingly, the process we followed and the rules complied with may not be appropriate for the next trial. The decisions made in this environment should not be considered to set precedent that is inflexible. In fact, the precedent we set deserves thoughtful consideration and reasoned critique when reflected upon in the years and decades to come. \\n   In that light, our official duties in this matter began on December 19, 1998, when the United States House of Representatives impeached the President, William Jefferson Clinton. After listening to the evidence, reading the trial memorandums and the record, and carefully considering the arguments presented by both the House Managers and White House counsel, I believe the President is guilty of both articles. \\n   Before I address the merits of the case against the President, I think it is necessary to discuss whether the crimes of perjury and obstruction of justice constitute high crimes and misdemeanors as contemplated by the Framers of our Constitution. This topic has been the subject of much controversy in the past months. \\n   It is true that private acts are the genesis of the matter before us. Had the acts stayed private, we would not be here today. The President, however, brought these private acts under our public purview and created a matter of public concern when he used his position and his power to deny and obstruct the civil rights of Paula Jones. \\n   Contrary to what has been asserted, this is not just a case about a sexual encounter between the President and a young White House intern. This instead is a case about depriving Paula Jones, an individual who sought and was granted the right to file a civil rights action against the President, of her constitutional right to a day in court, a right which nine justices of the Supreme Court unanimously decided that she deserved. And--almost unbelievably--on the heels of this Supreme Court mandate, the President seemed to strengthen his efforts to deny Paula Jones' civil rights. Once these acts moved into the public arena, forming the basis for charges as serious as perjury and obstruction of justice, it is my opinion these acts became high crimes and misdemeanors as envisioned by our Founders. While our only precedent involves the impeachments of federal judges, I am satisfied the standards used in these cases also apply to the charges levied against the President. \\n   The President of the United States is the head of the Executive Branch and the Chief Law Enforcement Officer of this nation. When the Founding Fathers established our tripartite system of government, it was decided that the three branches of government would operate as checks and balances on one another. As a result, no branch would be more powerful than the other. This structure is at the very core of our success as a Republic. \\n   By obstructing justice and lying under oath, William Jefferson Clinton violated his duty as Chief Law Enforcement Officer, disrespected the Judicial Branch of the government, and undermined the foundations of our judicial system's truth-seeking process. If I were to determine that the President's actions did not constitute high crimes and misdemeanors, I would be asserting that the Executive Branch and the Office of the Presidency are more important than the Judicial Branch, and that the President of the United States is not obligated to abide by the rule of law. As a citizen and as a Senator, I cannot, in good faith, ignore the separation of powers argument. In my view, the President's conduct was in violation of the rule of law and his actions have betrayed the trust of the people of the United States. It is my firm belief that the serious offenses committed by William Jefferson Clinton are high crimes and misdemeanors and warrant impeachment, conviction, and removal from office. \\n   Amazingly, we continue to hear the argument that although the President's actions rise to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors, he should not be removed from office. The Constitution provides if a President is found guilty of high crimes, then he is automatically removed from office. Our Constitution does not allow for finding the President guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors, and then permitting him to stay in office. Only an amendment to the Constitution would make such a step permissible. \\n   There were several points during the trial of the President when I had a visceral reaction to certain charges raised by the House Managers. This reaction occurred, each time, at precisely the point when the Managers discussed the President's strategy to attack the character of Monica Lewinsky, Kathleen Willey and others. The callous disregard for the soul of another human being and the unsympathetic wounding of the character of another carried out by the President using the apparatus of the Presidency is chilling and deserves condemnation by \\n   those who cherish freedom. \\n   Before I proceed to my view of the specific articles, it may help to explain that I approach this process unencumbered by a law degree. While that in no way gives me license to disregard the legal aspects of the matter before me, it does permit me to translate legal concepts into layman's terms. As I worked my way through the voluminous record and sat through days of the trial, I found it easiest to understand this case if I approached it in chronological order. Given that, I will discuss the Obstruction of Justice count first, because in the course of this tragic series of events, I believe the President started down this slippery slope by the actions he took, as  opposed to the words he spoke. Sadly, the words, uttered under an oath to tell the truth, came later. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990204\\n\\n    Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 346, a bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to prohibit the recoupment of funds recovered by states from one or more tobacco manufacturers. Starting in 1989, several states filed lawsuits against tobacco companies to recover the costs of smoking related illnesses borne by states. The lawsuits led to final settlements between each state and the tobacco industry. \\n   Now, after providing no assistance to states in their legal battles, the Administration, through the Health Care Financing Administration, is attempting to claim a portion of this money. It is my opinion that this money belongs to the individual states, and should be spent as each state sees fit. This legislation accomplishes exactly that goal. \\n   The Health Care Financing Administration's pursuit of these monies also could jeopardize state programs all over the country. In Florida, Governor Jeb Bush announced an endowment, funded by tobacco monies, to insure the financial health of vital programs for children and seniors. The endowment fund is named in honor of the late Governor Lawton Chiles, who played a key role in obtaining the tobacco settlement for the people of Florida. Other programs, funded by the settlement, have already been put in place in Florida, and would be jeopardized if the funds were suddenly not available. \\n   Additionally, the Health Care Financing Administration's plan to obtain these funds by witholding federal Medicaid payments to the states could very well affect the states' ability to provide much needed care for the millions of Americans who depend on Medicaid. \\n   The Administration's attempt to dictate how the money should be spent demonstrates a disregard for state budgeting process. I hope that my colleagues will support this bi-partisan bill that protects state tobacco settlements from federal recoupment.  \\n\\n\\n\""

Madam President, last year the Commerce, Justice, State and Judiciary Appropriations Subcommittee included funding for the Southern Florida Medical Corrections Options Program, which began operations this spring. Working with the Broward County Mental Health Court and the Broward County Sheriff's office it has had tremendous success in treating mentally ill misdemeanants and preventing recidivism. My colleague from Hawaii shares my interest in the program because Hawaii faces many of the same challenges as Florida in treating mentally ill misdemeanants. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-20001027\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. The Fiscal Year 2001 Commerce, State, Justice and the Judiciary Appropriations Committee Report includes a number of programs that the committee has encouraged the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) to examine and fund, if possible, under the Edward Byrne Memorial Discretionary Grants Program. I am hopeful that the BJA will consider funding for the joint Hawaii/Florida demonstration project to develop a national model for future mental health courts. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-3-20001027\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I thank the Chairman for his comments. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20001025\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I would like to engage Senator MCCONNELL, Chairman of the Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee in a colloquy regarding an important project addressed in both the Senate and House Committee Reports. This project is the Cuban Transition Project located in Miami, FL. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-20001025\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, my purpose for entering into this colloquy is to seek clarification from the Chairman regarding the Conferees' intent to support the Cuban Transition Project. The House Committee Report states that it supports $3.5 million be provided through USAID for this important initiative to provide policy makers, analysts and others with accurate information and practical policy recommendations that will be needed over a multi-year basis to assist this country in preparation for our next stage of interaction with the Cuban community and nation. The Senate Committee Report similarly supported this project, and it is my understanding that you support this project and intend that it receive support from USAID. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-3-20001025\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I thank the Chairman for reiterating his support and clarifying the intent of the subcommittee. This project has the strong support of the Chairman of the House International Relations Committee, and I know that this committee will also be expressing support to the agency. I would like to ask if you will be willing to further advise the Agency formally of your position on this matter. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-4-20001025\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I thank the Chairman for his comments. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20001019\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I would like to engage my colleague, Senator BOND, and Chairman of the Senate VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee in a brief colloquy concerning a provision in the conference agreement relating to the definition of ``urban county'' under federal housing law. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-20001019\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, as the Chairman knows, the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program statutory provisions relating to the ``urban county'' classification do not contemplate the form of consolidated city/county government found in Duval County, Florida (Jacksonville) where there is no unincorporated area. A recent decision by the Bureau of the Census, and subsequently by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), has questioned the status of Jacksonville/Duval County as an entitlement area. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-3-20001019\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, my purpose for entering into this colloquy is to seek clarification from the Chairman about the effect of the provision adopted by the Conference Committee to amend the definition of ``urban county'' to address this problem facing Jacksonville. \\n   Is it the Chairman's understanding that section 217 of the VA-HUD Conference Report addresses the concerns of the Town of Baldwin, Jacksonville and the Beaches communities, by amending current law to classify Jacksonville as an ``urban county''. Is it further his understanding that the language would preserve the area's longstanding status as an entitlement area for CDBG grants, while also allowing the Town of Baldwin to elect to have its population excluded from the entitlement area? \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-4-20001019\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I thank the Chairman for his comments.  \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20001012\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, the United States commitment to Israel is strong. It has stood the test of time, and has only strengthened. It is strong because it is grounded in our shared principles of freedom and democracy. It is also strong because we respect and appreciate Israel's commitment to preserve and protect those religious sites considered by all people of the world to be holy. \\n   I am very disturbed over recent events in the Middle East. America's response to Israel must be clear and reflect our total support. What we are witnessing is not, as it is often called, an ``outbreak of violence.'' What we are witnessing is a concerted attack against Israel; and this is occurring on the heels of the Israeli government taking the most conciliatory stance ever toward the Palestinians. \\n   After the Camp David summit, President Clinton correctly blamed Palestinian Authority Chairman Yassir Arafat for rejecting the compromises that Israel was willing to consider. Since Camp David, Arafat has compounded his rejection of peace proposals with an embrace of violence. The United States must maintain its pressure on Arafat and the Palestinian leadership, and avoid retreating into the moral swamp of ``evenhandedness.'' We must stand with Israel. \\n   I am deeply disappointed in the shameful U.S. abstention on a UN Security Council resolution that our own ambassador called ``unbalanced, biased, and really a lousy piece of work.'' \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-20001012\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, we must speak the truth and stand on principle, so that Arafat cannot continue blaming Israel for the completely unjustified attack that he \\n   initiated. There is a word for a policy of rewarding violence, and that word is ``appeasement.'' \\n   Appeasement is not just wrong; it also does not work. Events of recent days have led many Israelis to conclude that their government's generosity toward the Palestinians has--far from being reciprocated--been taken as weakness and invited the beating of war drums against Israel throughout the Arab world. \\n   As Israel begins to rethink its course, the United States must not push Israel towards appeasement. We must help Israel find the strength to stand up to aggression and continue the principled fight for justice. \\n   As citizens of a democracy that desperately wants peace, Israelis are as pained as anyone by the heart-wrenching pictures of Palestinian children caught in the crossfire. Israel can be counted on to search its soul as to whether she could have defended herself and claimed fewer Palestinian casualties. The result of such an inquiry, however, will not shift the overarching burden of responsibility from the party that chose to abandon the negotiating table and open a shooting war--Palestinian leader Yassir Arafat. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20001011\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, as an original sponsor of the Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act, I wish to make clear that the reference to June 7, 1999 in the anti-terrorism section of H.R. 3244 is intended to refer to the case of Thomas M. Sutherland. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20001011\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I thank Senator LAUTENBERG for making a point with which I strongly agree: the waiver authority in this legislation is intended to be used on each case or for each asset, but not to be used as a de-facto veto. \\n   In drafting this language and negotiating with the administration over the past several months, we believe firmly that using blocked assets of terrorist states to satisfy judgments is completely consistent with the intent of the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1996, and more significantly, is consistent with our national security interest. Simply stated, making the terrorists who harm or kill Americans in acts of international terrorism pay for their acts makes for good policy. It should deter future acts of terrorism, as well as provide some small measure of justice to current victims. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20001005\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I object. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20001005\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, as my colleagues know, I will be leaving the Senate at the end of my term. I want to put a few thoughts on the record over the next few days, depending on the time available. \\n   I have four grandchildren--three grandsons and one granddaughter--Ronnie Elam, Brett Elam, Blake Caldwell, and Addison McGillicuddy. The comments I am going to make today really are from the perspective of thinking about them and their future and the desire to see that they will grow up in a country and in a world where their opportunities will be equal to, if not better than, those of their parents, their grandparents, and their great-grandparents. I want them to have a better understanding when they reach that point when they have their own families. \\n   As people look back on the last several decades of the 20th century, I want, at least from my perspective, to be able to put on the record what I believe happened from both an economic and foreign policy perspective, and from a national security perspective. So that is what my comments will reflect today, my thoughts with respect to economics primarily and some that will reflect my feelings with respect to national defense. \\n   So I would like to talk about economics, a topic that has been one of my passions as a Member of the Congress. Economic policy was the very reason I ran for the House of Representatives back in 1982. As many of us may recall, our country remained in a deep recession at the time, still struggling to recover from the economic policies of the 1970s. Although it was still being phased in, President Reagan's economic program was under attack by our friends across the aisle. But, to me, the Reagan economic program was a bold reaffirmation of the very purpose of America. \\n   Many people have noted the happy coincidence that the year 1776 saw the publication of two of the most important documents in world history, Adam Smith's ``Wealth Of Nations'' and Thomas Jefferson's Declaration of Independence. These works share the theme of freedom. Smith made the case for free trade and unfettered markets, as Jefferson put in words the concept that government exists to protect individual liberty. \\n   These documents rebutted, refined, and transcended the prevailing views of 1776 Great Britain. For over a century, these principles held firm and the United States stood tall as a beacon of hope and opportunity for people from all points on the globe. \\n   Ours was a society without a rigid class structure, a society that promised equal opportunity for all based on individual enterprise and hard work, not government privileges and connections. America had no large bureaucracies intruding upon every sphere of commercial life. We relied on the willingness of individuals to shoulder the risk and responsibility that is part and parcel of private enterprise. \\n   But this distinctly American way was challenged by two worldwide crises in the 20th century. First came the Great Depression. Although gross government mismanagement of the money supply and counterproductive trade policies were the cause of this crisis, government was put forward as the cure. This led to the proliferation of alphabet agencies seeking to steer every aspect of the American economy, as government assumed a new income redistribution role. \\n   The second crisis was the rise of totalitarianism on the European Continent. The United States won World War II, but in the process of saving Europe from one brand of tyranny, an equally evil force came to occupy half of Europe, and the war effort was used as the justification for price controls and economic intervention that was unprecedented in the United States. \\n   The welfare state in America grew by leaps and bounds. Once it was conceded that the Government is the guarantor of income, each successive call for new and bigger programs became harder and harder to resist. At the same time, the consolidation of the Soviet bloc presented the largest threat to freedom in human history, presenting new and costly challenges for America as the beacon of freedom. Exaggerations of Soviet economic success fueled the call for greater Government involvement in the U.S. economy. Over time, high tax rates and regulatory excesses accumulated like barnacles to slow the once mighty ship of American private enterprise. \\n   It is hard for younger Americans to imagine how bleak our Nation's prospects appeared before Reagan assumed the Presidency. Recurrent, simultaneous bouts of high unemployment and high inflation confounded most economists, who viewed the two as a tradeoff. It was thought that to reduce unemployment you had to accept inflation and to reduce inflation you had to accept higher unemployment. Producers and consumers suffered from an energy crisis. And real household incomes were shrinking as fast as ``bracket creep'' was raising everyone's tax bill year after year. The response of the incumbent administration was hardly inspiring--ranging from suggesting ``voluntary'' wage and price controls to preaching that we must learn to live within limits. In short, the American establishment was telling the American people to accept the notion that they no longer controlled their own economic destinies. \\n   Starting in the 1970s, the media aggressively advanced the notion popular in intellectual circles that America's free enterprise system was failing. This view persisted through the 1980s. The best-seller lists were crowded with books telling of the decline of America and predicting that Japan would be the economic juggernaut of the 21st century. Even in the 1992 campaign, Bill Clinton and AL GORE were extolling the virtues of the European economic systems, of social democracy and industrial planning. We hear echoes of this approach today, with candidate AL GORE's Government-knows-best mentality. GORE proposes to micromanage and fine-tune the economy, social engineering through tax credits designed to make people behave the way the Washington bureaucrats want them to--such as buying ``fuel-efficient'' eighteen-wheeler trucks. \\n   Ronald Reagan's ``Program for Economic Recovery'' was the opposite of the Government planning approach advocated by the critics of capitalism. Reagan rejected the idea that policymakers could fine-tune the economy,  much less control it from Washington. Instead, he sought to establish a stable environment conducive to economic growth. This meant getting inflation under control, and reducing taxes, regulation, and the size and scope of Government. It meant restoring the incentives for working, saving, investing, and succeeding. It meant opening America to the benefits and challenges of international trade. \\n   Ronald Reagan's economic principles resonated within me. I had seen first-hand the obvious connection between the expansion of Government and our worsening economic performance. When I started in the banking business in 1966, I probably spent 90 to 95 percent of my time engaged in activities that I considered productive--designing new services to attract business, working to increase the market share and profitability of the bank. The rest involved Government paperwork. By the time I left in 1982, this ratio had completely flipped: I was spending 85 to 90 percent of my time trying to figure out how to comply with Government regulations and mandates. There was a constant stream of letters from the Government dictating how we should manage our business, from the Comptroller of the Currency, the Treasury, the FDIC, and the Federal Reserve, on topics ranging from flood insurance to so-called truth-in-lending. I remember a letter that went so far as to tell us the specific temperatures to set our heating and cooling thermostats in our businesses. Some people may have forgotten this level of Government intrusion. \\n   In fact, others may believe it never could happen in a country such as America, but it has. It has happened before, and if we are not vigilant, it could happen again. \\n   I received a letter from Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker detailing which types of loans we could and could not make. To make the example, I could lend a family money to add an additional bedroom to their home. If that same family wanted to add a swimming pool to their home, I was prohibited from making that loan. \\n   To some, this may have made sense if you believed that the Government should be managing consumer demand, but that role made no sense to me. \\n   With my experience in the banking business, it wasn't hard to understand why we as a nation were having difficulty competing around the globe, when we had moved so many of our resources away from productive activities and into trying to comply with Government regulations. Over the years I had come to realize that all the abstract Keynesian theories I was taught in college ignored how the choices and incentives of individuals are altered by government interference in the economy. By failing to account for the real world, those theories in practice had come pretty close to ruining the economy. But along came Ronald Reagan, with a common sense approach that went back to basics--free markets, free enterprise, free trade. Here was a man who had recognized that big Government was a detriment to the economy, a man who approached things from the perspective of freedom as opposed to Government. I shared that perspective and recognized the importance of President Reagan's election. On election night, November 4, 1980, I knew that I had to get involved in this great campaign to restore freedom--but I would have never guessed that, two decades later, I would be standing here in the United States Senate. \\n   Ronald Reagan clearly saw that the problem was too much government, and the solution was more individual freedom. When he assumed the Presidency, we suffered from high inflation and high unemployment. To combat the first, he prescribed reigning in the rapid growth of the money supply, asking the Fed to minimize the damage to the economy caused by high and volatile inflation. The second problem required deep cuts in the high tax rates that were deterring work, saving, and investment. But the Fed delivered tight money a lot sooner than the Congress could deliver the tax cuts, which were phased-in over 3 years. The Fed had overreacted to the stimulus of tax cuts that had not yet arrived, exacerbating the economic downtown, throwing the budget seriously out of balance, and putting the third year of the Reagan tax rate reductions in jeopardy. \\n   In the recession of the early 1980s, the economic policies of President Reagan that inspired me to public service came under attack. In the now famous ``Stay the Course'' campaign of 1982, the President's party retained control of the Senate, minimized losses in the House despite the dire economic times, and preserved the Reagan economic program. We also kept on track President Reagan's defense policies, which were under attack from short-sighted critics who were unwilling to pay the price to ensure our freedom. I am proud that my first campaign was in that fateful year, when President Reagan's detractors stood a chance of putting his programs in jeopardy and I was able to make a stand in favor of his programs. \\n   As I mentioned, the Reagan economic program was my inspiration to run for office. As a freshman, I cut my teeth in the House by circulating a letter vowing support for the President's veto of any bill that tampered with the third year of the tax cuts. After I obtained the 146 signatures necessary to sustain a veto, that threat disappeared, and the Kemp-Roth tax cuts were allowed to work. President Reagan's most dramatic policy change was without a doubt this supply-side tax cut. It seems also inconceivable today that just two decades ago, marginal income tax rates were as high as 70 percent in the United States. It was little wonder that our country was in economic decline, when its most economically productive citizens could keep only a 30 percent share of their additional earnings. These high tax rates not only discouraged additional work and investment at the margin, but also confiscated capital that could have been used for job creation by the private sector. \\n   By cutting income tax rates by 30 percent across-the-board, Reagan restored a large measure of freedom to the American taxpayer--not just the freedom to spend money that would have been taxed away, but the freedom that results when economic decisions are no longer influenced by high tax rates. It was not about the dollars that would have been collected had tax rates stayed high, but the choices that would never have been made because of these high rates--decisions to expand plant capacities or start new businesses, for instance. \\n   President Reagan entered the White House with one paramount spending goal: to rebuild our national defense, since national security is the most fundamental responsibility of the Federal Government. He realized that to provide this desperately needed public good, while cutting tax rates to unleash the productive forces of the nation, required fiscal restraint in the non-defense portion of the Federal budget. \\n   The difficulties that President Reagan had in taming the congressional urge to spend made a balanced budget and tax limitation amendment to the Constitution one of my top priorities when I entered Congress. It also motivated me to be the main House sponsor, along with Dick Cheney, of the Gramm-Rudman Deficit Reduction Act, which worked for at least a few years to hold spending down. Today, as much as ever, I believe some super majority restriction on the ability of Members of Congress to spend taxpayers' dollars is necessary. Unless taxes are cut to keep the revenues from flowing into Washington, the trillions of dollars of surpluses that are projected over the next decade will not last--if the taxes are collected, Congress will spend them. \\n   Reagan also initiated a sea change in monetary policy. He did not want the Federal Reserve to manipulate the money supply in an attempt to target interest or unemployment rates. All he wanted was price stability, the elimination of high levels of inflation from the economy. The Fed should not be responsible for the level of growth in the economy--this is the role of the private sector. The best economic environment that the Fed can provide is one in which inflation expectations play a small or almost nonexistent role in long-term planning. Reagan's appointees to the Federal Reserve Board, people like Alan Greenspan, Preston Martin, Manley Johnson, Martha Seger, and Wayne Angell, shared this view and took politics out of monetary policy.  \\n   Throughout the Reagan years, the loudest and strongest advocate of stable prices in the Congress was Jack Kemp. Jack would talk tirelessly about the need for ``a dollar as good as gold,'' and his intellectual and political support for this position no doubt influenced President Reagan's selection of Greenspan as Fed Chairman. Alan Greenspan continues to hold sway at the Federal Reserve as part of the Reagan legacy, and his record at containing inflation has set a high standard. As a member of the Senate Banking Committee I have attempted to institutionalize this approach to monetary policy, sponsoring a bill that would make price stability, not economic growth or ``stabilization,'' the goal of the Federal Reserve. Thanks to the monetary policy initiated by President Reagan, this legislation is now a safeguard rather than a necessity. \\n   The prevailing attitude concerning trade has also shifted, thanks to President Reagan--who recognized the fallacy of protectionism. In large part, this was due to his belief in competition and free enterprise. But his attitude was also shaped by his confidence in America. He was neither afraid of foreign competition, nor embarrassed that imports might be preferred over American goods. America, as a nation of immigrants, represents the best that the world can offer. More than any consumer good, the main export of America must be the ideal of political and economic freedom, an ideal that is undercut by trade restrictions. \\n   By signing a free trade agreement with Canada, opening free trade negotiations with Mexico, and proposing the dismantling of agricultural trade barriers in the Uruguay Round of the GATT, Ronald Reagan went on the offensive for trade liberalization. At a time when Japan-bashing was commonplace--when Members of Congress were literally bashing Japanese-made electronics into pieces on the steps of the Capitol--Reagan did not retreat from his basic free-trade principles. The remarkable success of U.S. industries from computers, semiconductors, software, biotechnology and many others over the past 2 decades has vindicated Reagan's belief that American business prospers best in an open and competitive free enterprise environment. \\n   Today, principally as a result of the supply-side policies pursued by the Reagan administration, the U.S. economy is healthy. Both inflation and unemployment are low. Productivity is growing rapidly and incomes are rising. \\n   Any doubts that President Reagan is responsible for today's bounty should be dispelled by considering a few fundamental questions. Would American economic growth be as robust today if the Federal Government still took 70 cents of every additional dollar of income from our most productive citizens? If the typical family was hit with a 49 percent Federal income tax rate on top of an effective payroll tax rate of 14.2 percent? \\n   Would our economy be so strong if we were still suffering from double-digit inflation and interest rates, due to the politicized use of monetary policy to manipulate consumer demand? If the trend of the last 2 decades were toward managed trade, rather than freer trade? Would entrepreneurs and innovators abound if high inflation and high tax rates on capital gains slashed the returns to their risk-taking? \\n   Would the Soviet Empire have fallen if it had not been for the military buildup, diplomatic leadership, and resolute defense of freedom during the presidency of Ronald Reagan? Would our country be as secure as it is today if instead of trading partners, the people of Eastern and Central Europe were still prisoners of the Soviet bloc? If our fellow Americans south of our border were still the potential victims of imported totalitarianism instead of full participants in established democracies? \\n   Our debt to Ronald Reagan reminds me of an exchange mission I once went on, with Tom Foley and Dick Cheney. \\n   It was a congressional delegation that went to France in 1985. On that trip, we spent most of our time in Paris. But for the last several days, we went out to the French countryside. I went to a little town called Le Mans, where I traveled around with my host, Francois, from that district. I learned a lot about what his country was experiencing. \\n   At the end of that tour, we did what many of us would refer to as an old-fashioned town meeting, where I responded to questions from the French audience for almost 2 hours. At the end of the period, I asked Francois if it would be all right if I were to ask the audience a question. And he was gracious in my request, and I asked them: Since I am returning to America tomorrow, I would like to be able to tell other people of the State of Florida what you think about our country. \\n   The first person stood up and said: ``We think of America as a dynamic, growing, thriving, exciting place.'' A second person that stood up said basically the same thing. The third person to address me was a fellow who probably was in his late 70's or early 80's. This fellow was stooped over, his weight being supported precariously on an old, gnarled cane. He came over closer to me, looked me directly in the eyes, and said: ``You tell the people of America that we will never forget that it was the American G.I. who saved our little town. You tell them we'll never forget!'' \\n   Well, I feel that way about Ronald Reagan, my political hero, who inspired me to enter politics. America will never forget what President Reagan did for us. He gave us back our faith and renewed our belief in this country. He gave America back its pride. He rebuilt America's defenses. His economic policies reduced taxes, reduced inflation, reduced unemployment. He put America back to work again. He reminded America what made us a great nation--our commitment to freedom. And he won the cold war without firing a single shot. \\n   The citizens of America and the people of the world will never forget. \\n   Mr. President, I yield the floor.    \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20001005\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it recess until the hour of 9:30 a.m. on Friday, October 6. I further ask unanimous consent that on Friday, immediately following the prayer, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and the Senate then begin a period of morning business with the time until 10 a.m. equally divided in the usual form. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20001005\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 10 a.m. Following morning business, the Senate may begin consideration of the Transportation appropriations conference report or the sex trafficking victims conference report. It is hoped that the Senate can begin consideration of either of these conference reports prior to noon tomorrow. Therefore, votes could occur by midmorning. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-20001005\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Certainly. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-3-20001005\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I think that is probably as close to a ``definite maybe'' as you can get in the Senate at this time. \\n   I suggest the absence of a quorum. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20001005\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of Coptic Christians in Egypt who have been persecuted because of their religious beliefs. According to reports by both the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights and Freedom House in the United States, up to 1,200 Coptic Christians in Al-Kosheh, Egypt, were detained, interrogated, and subjected to police brutality in relation to the murders of two other Coptic Christians in 1998. After weeks of reported torture, these accounts suggest that confessions were obtained under duress that identified Shaiboub William Arsel as the murderer. Mr. Arsel was subsequently sentenced to 15 years of hard labor. \\n   Over the last two years I have met with officials from the Egyptian government, including President Hosni Mubarak on several occasions in an attempt to address this issue quietly. Unfortunately, these discussions have failed to produce sufficient action on the part of the government of Egypt. As a result, I rise today to submit a resolution urging the President to encourage the Egyptian government to provide Shaiboub William Arsel with a timely and open appeal that would include international observers, and furthermore to complete an independent investigation of the police brutality in Al-Kosheh. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20001005\\n\\n   Mr. MACK.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be agreed to, the bill be read a third time and passed, as amended, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements relating to the bill be printed in the RECORD. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20001003\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, as a co-sponsor of the Community Renewal and New Markets Act of 2000, I want to commend Chairman ROTH for his usual fine work in assembling a bill that garners the support of such a large number of our Finance Committee colleagues. I am pleased that a number of items in this bill are provisions that are extremely important to me, and I would like to speak briefly concerning them. \\n   But I also want to draw attention to some provisions in this bill that I do not favor. As this bill stands in the place of what would have been a bill reported out of the Committee on Finance, it reflects the compromises that are inherent in the committee process. Unlike typical bills, of which it is reasonable to assume that every provision is supported by every co-sponsor, probably every co-sponsor of this bill can find provisions contained in it that he does not support. Of many, there are two that I find most troubling: the ``new markets tax credit,'' and the ``individual development accounts.'' \\n   These two provisions are appropriations masquerading as tax cuts. Under the new markets tax credit, the Secretary of the Treasury would annually pay dividends to investors in ``community development entities,'' which must be certified by the Treasury Department and which must have as their primary mission investing in low-income people or communities. This proposal is premised on the belief that an entity that lacks a profit-motive, under federal bureaucratic supervision, will be an attractive investment for people if dividends are guaranteed. It is the sort of scheme that could only be dreamed up by people who have spent their entire careers in government. A simpler way to direct capital to investment-starved pockets is by eliminating the tax on capital gains--this is the decentralized, market-oriented approach. \\n   The ``individual development accounts'' would launder government-matching funds for low income savers through financial institutions. This new entitlement cannot be justified. It is true that, by some measures, the savings rate in the United States appears low. Simple logic dictates that the savings rate have been lowered due to federal tax policies, which impose several layers of taxation upon income that is saved. It is one thing to address this problem at the source, by removing the extra taxation on savings--a we do to the extent that people can make deductible contributions to traditional IRAs and contributions to Roth IRAs. But to give people money to reward them for saving is pure income redistribution, a misuse of the taxpayers' money. \\n   Despite my disagreement with some of the provisions of this bill, I am pleased that the bill contains several initiatives that I have proposed over the past few Congresses. The Low Income Housing Tax Credit is boosted to make up for over a decade's worth of inflation, and is indexed to prevent this problem from reoccurring. The First-Time Homebuyer Tax Credit for the District of Columbia is extended and the marriage penalty in the credit is eliminated. Section 1706 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which discriminates against high technology workers and the companies that hire them, is repealed. Not-for-hire disaster insurance funds, in my state of Florida and several others, are made tax-exempt entities. \\n   I am most encouraged by the extension of my zero percent capital gains tax rate proposal to businesses in the entire District of Columbia, and to businesses in all empowerment and renewal zones. Although I am concerned that the lengthy, five-year holding period is unwise and undermines the power of the proposal, I am nevertheless pleased that the idea is spreading and people are coming to see capitalism as the only true cure for poverty. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20001002\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I move to lay that motion on the table. \\n   The motion to lay on the table was agreed to. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000925\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Madam President, I rise today to engage my colleague from Florida in a colloquy. Specifically, I want to clarify our understanding of the portion of the legislation we're considering today to restore, preserve and protect the Everglades ecosystem. My understanding is that the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan authorized by this bill create a balance between state and federal interests in ensuring that the predicted Plan benefits--including benefits to both state and federal lands--are attained. It is my view that this bill is intended to recognize and maintain the State's interest in preserving the sovereignty, in State law, over the reservation and allocation of water within the State's boundaries. It is my further understanding that the Agreement called for between the President and the Governor of Florida will not result in a federalization of State water law. Florida water law requires that all reasonable beneficial water uses and natural system demands are subject to a public interest balancing test. Implementation of the Plan will rely upon State law and processes for reserving and allocating water for all users, according to the principles set out in the legislation before us. It is not the intent of this Act, or the President/Governor Agreement required by this Act, to create a procedure where all of the new water made available by the Plan will be allocated to the natural system leaving nothing for other water users. Rather, the agreement will simply ensure that water for the natural system is reserved first, and any remaining water may be allocated among other users according to the provisions of State water law. I yield to my colleague from Florida, Senator GRAHAM. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-20000925\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I appreciate the comments of my colleague and yield the floor. \\n   SECTON 211, PROJECT DEAUTHORIZATION\\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-3-20000925\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Madam President, I rise today to call the Senate's attention to a provision of the bill before us expressing the sense of the Senate concerning Homestead Air Force Base in Florida. I want to take a moment of the Senate's time today to express my understanding of this resolution and my own intent in agreeing to its inclusion in the bill before us today. \\n   As my colleagues are aware, this Air Force base is currently in the disposal process set forth by Congress when it established a fair and impartial system for closing military facilities around the country. Since Hurricane Andrew devastated the region in 1992, the citizens of South Florida have waited for a disposal decision from the federal government. It is anticipated the property could provide a stable economic platform for a community that is in need of jobs and economic development. Clearly, it is my intent that whatever use to which the property is ultimately put be accomplished in a manner that does not adversely impact the surrounding environment or the Everglades restoration plan we're considering today. \\n   But let me be clear, Mr. President. It is emphatically not my intent that this resolution be read by the United States Air Force to mean they should add to, alter, or amend the existing process for disposing the property at Homestead Air Force Base. It is my strong view that the process for conveying surplus military property is clearly set forth in the law and that process should be followed until the final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement on the property is completed and the Air Force disposes the property. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-4-20000925\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Yes. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-5-20000925\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Madam President, I will only take a moment of the Senate's time today--prior to the vote on the Water Resources Development Act--to acknowledge the importance of this moment and the action the Senate will take today to restore and preserve America's Everglades. \\n   My colleague, Senator GRAHAM, and I have worked for eight years to bring this bill to the floor and it gives me great satisfaction that today it will be approved by the Senate. \\n   I want especially to thank Chairman SMITH for his dedication to this effort over the past few months. He has worked side-by-side with us to develop the consensus product we're voting on today. As we developed this legislation, he and his staff provided valuable input into the process and we appreciate the long hours they put in on our behalf. \\n   Further, I want to--once again--acknowledge my colleague, Senator GRAHAM. He has worked on Everglades issues for years--even prior to his time in the Senate--and it has been a pleasure to work with him over the years as we worked on the legislation before us. \\n   The Corps of Engineers, the Department of Interior, and the Council on Environmental Quality have worked long hours to turn this bill into reality. I appreciate the support of these agencies throughout the process and for the proof--once again--that saving the Everglades is not a partisan issue. \\n   And finally, I want to acknowledge the hard work and steadfast support of Governor Bush. The State of Florida is a full partner with us in this restoration effort, and I believe the work we've put in together in writing this bill bodes well for a lasting partnership on behalf of the Everglades. \\n   The Everglades is an American treasure. Today we in the Senate will take a major step forward in passing a restoration plan that is rooted in good science, common sense, and consensus. I thank everyone who participated in this process for their hard work and dedication to the effort. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000921\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I want to say to my dear friend, the Senator from Virginia, I thoroughly enjoyed listening to his presentation. And I say this with all good humor. It was a great performance. It reminded me a little of Chicken Little in ``The Sky is Falling'' when I listened to equating $86 million in operating expenses to a $1.4 billion budget. The $86 million will be the cost of operating and maintaining this new system 25 or 30 years from now. I think it might be appropriate to try to figure out what the Corps' budget might be 25 or 30 years from now. I think that would bring a more significant understanding of the impact of the operating and maintenance costs to the Federal Government. \\n   The second point I will make is that we are already spending more than that now on the Everglades. I suggest that on this project we are proposing today--and I believe strongly that it will pass--we will probably seek a reduction in the long run as a part of the Corps' budget. But, again, I appreciate the fervor with which my colleague presented his argument. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-20000921\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I am sure we will.  \\n   Mr. President, I am in strong opposition to the amendment offered by my friend from Virginia. This amendment, if passed, will put an end to the unprecedented partnership developed between the Federal Government and the State of Florida in an effort to restore and protect America's Everglades. While I am sure my colleague from Virginia has the best of intentions in offering his amendment, I caution my colleagues that one-size-fits-all solutions can be extremely harmful to \\n   something as sensitive and as difficult as Everglades restoration. \\n   It may be useful to take a few minutes today to help highlight the Everglades provision in the water resources bill before us and explain how the amendment of the Senator from Virginia will impact our longstanding efforts to restore and protect this unique ecosystem. \\n   Let me begin by stating that the legislation before us today is a consensus product supported by a full spectrum of environmental groups and economic stakeholders. It is supported by Florida's two Indian tribes, Gov. Jeb Bush of the State of Florida, and it is supported by the Clinton administration. \\n   Nine months ago, my colleague from Florida, Senator GRAHAM, and I set out to write a balanced Everglades bill that addressed the needs of south Florida's environment and its citizens. This was no small task. We asked individuals and groups who have long been divided to set aside their differences and work together with us. We asked them to help us restore this vibrant, natural system to its former glory. With the steady leadership of Chairman BOB SMITH and Senator BAUCUS, we have accomplished our goal. The bill we bring to the floor today is something of which all Americans, and I believe all Senators, can be proud. \\n   In the bill we are considering today, we authorize a comprehensive plan to undo the harm done by 50 years of Federal efforts to control flooding in south Florida, without consideration for damage done to south Florida's environment. This comprehensive plan was developed over the past 8 years by the Corps of Engineers, with input from economic and environmental stakeholders, local governments, scientists, restoration engineers, the people of south Florida, and the Congress. It is recognized throughout south Florida and the Nation as a fair and balanced plan to provide for the water-related needs of the region while, for the first time, ensuring that the needs of the Everglades will be met as well. \\n   It is terribly important that we do this. Without this plan, the Everglades will die and water, the lifeblood of south Florida's economy, will continue to be siphoned off into the sea without benefiting the environment or the people who live and work in the region. \\n   Let me take a moment to share with you some of the principles Senator GRAHAM and I have used to guide our efforts this year in drafting this bill. We wanted to be sensitive to the legitimate concerns and needs of all citizens and interests who have a stake in how the plan is implemented, we wanted to be true to the restoration mandate and ensure that the Everglades got the first benefit of any new water generated by the plan, and we wanted to affirm and establish in law the true partnership we share with the State of Florida in achieving the plan's restoration goal. \\n   The cooperation between the State agencies charged with managing this effort and the Federal Government over the years has been truly unprecedented. The State shared the cost of developing the plan we are considering today. The Corps of Engineers has benefited greatly from the engineering talent at the South Florida Water Management District. Florida has been our full partner in bearing half of the cost of the restoration projects already underway in the Everglades. The State has committed to split evenly the cost of implementing the plan once it is authorized. The reason for this partnership is simple. \\n   Both the State and Federal Government have a vital interest in the restoration of the Everglades. Both the State and the Federal Government should pay for the cost of operating and maintaining the restoration project once it is built. \\n   I say this to provide background for the debate on the amendment before us. This partnership we have established is vital to our efforts, and if this amendment passes, it will be very difficult to accomplish our restoration goals. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-3-20000921\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, a key part of this partnership has been the commitment by the State of Florida--already enshrined in a bill approved by Governor Bush earlier this year--to pay fully half the $7.8 billion cost of implementing the Everglades restoration plan. This is a significantly greater cost share than the local sponsor typically pays to construct a Corps project. \\n   Many Corps projects have a local cost share of as little as 20 percent of the total project and few pay more than 35 percent. In fact, if the State were paying 35 percent, rather than the 50 percent it has committed to, it would increase the burden of the Federal taxpayer by almost $1.2 billion. Let me repeat that. The State has committed to a greater-than-average cost share for constructing the restoration project and will save the Federal taxpayers almost $1.2 billion. \\n   I believe the good faith demonstrated by the State's offer--not to mention the resulting savings of the Federal Government--clearly refutes any argument that the State is somehow unduly benefiting from the operation and maintenance cost share proposed in the bill before us today. \\n   While I cannot stress enough the damage this amendment will do to our relationship with the State of Florida, I remind my colleagues about the significant Federal investment we are making in the Everglades and the important Federal interest in ensuring this project is operated and maintained properly. \\n   Within the boundaries of the proposed restoration area, there are four national parks, including Everglades National Park, one of the crown jewels of our National Park System. There is a national marine sanctuary and many other national interests. All of these important environmental assets are dependent upon the successful operation of the restoration plan. \\n   If the project is not operated properly--if the water is not right--these important Federal holdings in south Florida will continue to suffer the same fate they are suffering today. If we and the State of Florida are to come together behind a restoration plan and spend $7.8 billion to implement that plan, it seems we also have the responsibility and obligation to stay in Florida and help with the successful operation and maintenance of the project. That is a reasonable position. \\n   I add that the operation and maintenance cost share in this bill is fully consistent with prior central and southern Florida project authorizations. In fact, the Federal Government pays the full cost of operating and maintaining the levees, channels, locks, and control works of the St. Lucie Canal, Lake Okeechobee, and the Caloosahatchee River. The Federal Government pays the full cost--not 50-50, but the full cost--of operating the levees, channels, locks, and control works of the St. Lucie Canal, Lake Okeechobee, and the Caloosahatchee River. All of these areas that I have mentioned are in this restoration area. It pays the full cost of operating and maintaining the main spillways in the system's water conservation area. \\n   Further, the Flood Control Act of 1968 provided that the project costs of providing water delivery to Everglades National Park is considered a federal responsibility and on that basis the federal government would share in the operation and maintenance of projects that serve that area of the system. The federal government is also required, under a 1989 law, to participate in the cost share for the modified water deliveries project. And, finally, the water resources bill of 1996 provides that the cost of operating and maintaining water deliveries to Taylor Slough and Everglades National Park be shared between the State and federal governments. \\n   That is my argument to this constant mention of the fact that for 14 years we have had this precedent.  \\n   I have just stated the whole series of issues related to the Everglades in which there is a whole range of the sharing of costs and maintaining the Everglades system. \\n   There appears to be ample precedent for a shared cost between the State and federal governments on projects related to the Everglades and Everglades restoration. \\n   What the Senator from Virginia is advocating is something far different. He would have the federal government pack up and leave when the restoration project is completed--essentially abandoning precedent and abandoning a national treasure after an unprecedented effort to save it. His amendment would have the federal government abdicate its responsibility, to both the environment and the taxpayer, to protect the substantial investment we're making on their behalf in the Everglades. \\n   I would remind my colleagues, the Everglades is a dynamic system. It is dependent on the steady, reliable supply of fresh water this restoration project will provide over the years. \\n   It is not like a levee, or a bridge, which the federal government can construct and turn over to the local authorities. This is an enormously complex restoration project managing the water flow over and through 18,000 square miles of subtropical uplands, wetlands and coral reefs. The area covered by this project spans from Lake Okeechobee to Key West; from Fort Myers on the gulf to Fort Pierce on the Atlantic. \\n   This is not an investment we can afford to abandon, Mr. President. The investment is too great and the stakes are too high. I would urge my colleagues to defeat the amendment. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-4-20000921\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I wanted to respond to the question. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-5-20000921\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. This will be a brief response. I apologize to my colleagues for trying to hop in here, but the Senator raised a question I thought should be responded to: What makes us different? \\n   In the State of Florida, in 1994, we passed the Everglades Forever Act which provides for local payment of water cleanup costs. The Federal Government's share in the cost of cleaning up the water that directly benefits Federal areas such as the Everglades National Park--the fact is that the local communities are paying for the cleanup of the waters that the Senator has suggested. \\n   The second point I make, I think there is something unique about what we have come up with. The Senator says the uniqueness is the 50-50 cost sharing. The uniqueness that I see--and I don't think there is a Member who has traveled to the State of Florida and become involved and knowledgeable about the Everglades Project, who is not amazed by the partnerships that have been developed--is the various interests in our State that have come together and who have said not only do they support but they are willing to put money into it. \\n   As the Senator knows, the State of Florida, during this past legislative session, in fact, put up I believe almost $200 million towards this project. \\n   Again, to answer the question directly, the cities are, in fact, paying. The State of Florida anticipated that question in 1994 and passed the act that I referred to a few moments ago. \\n   I thank the Senator for yielding. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-6-20000921\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I believe, if I can respond, and perhaps I can \\n   find the language, if you read further on in the act, you will find some language that has to do with some cost sharing of the area that the Senator is referring to as identifying certain aspects of the bill, but there are other references in there about following precedent with respect to cost sharing. There is, as I read in my statement, a whole series of things in which there is even 100-percent participation at the Federal level for operation and maintenance. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-7-20000921\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I respond to the question raised by the Senator from Virginia when we were talking about cost share. I suggested to Senator WARNER, if he looked in other places in Public Law 104, which is referred to as the Water Resources Development Act of 1996, he would find other language different from the language to which he was referring. That is found in section 316, central and southern Florida Canal, 111. Under ``Operation and Maintenance,'' it says:  \\n   The non-Federal share of operation and maintenance cost of the improvements undertaken pursuant to this section shall be 100 percent;  \\n   However, if you go on, it says:  \\n   ......except that the Federal Government shall reimburse the non-Federal interest with respect to the project 60 percent of the cost of operating and maintaining pump stations that pump water into Taylor Slough and in the Everglades National Park.  \\n   I wonder what the argument was 14 years ago about changing precedent. People want to refer to precedent. The reality is that Congress does what the Congress believes is necessary to carry out an important project. I think it is pretty clear. In fact, my colleagues who oppose this cost share have indicated they are going to support the resolution, or support the act; therefore, I think, accepting the notion of the significance and importance of what we are doing. And therefore it is reasonable for the Senate to determine on this particular project because of its unusual, unique circumstances, that somehow we should, in fact, have a 50-50 cost share. \\n   I do not find that stunning, and I am not impressed with the fact that for the last 14 years which some want to refer to that there has been a precedent established. There are all kinds of indications that we have had different cost shares, to the extent that we find in some areas the Federal Government is picking up 100 percent of the cost of operation and maintenance. \\n   I again say to my colleagues, I hope they will support Senator GRAHAM and I and Senators SMITH and BAUCUS and defeat this amendment. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-8-20000921\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I echo the sentiments of the Senator from Florida about the Adaptive Assessment and Monitoring Program. As this is a long-term plan spanning almost 25 years in execution, it stands to reason that research will yield new information and technology changes will yield new solutions. The Adaptive Assessment and Monitoring Program is critical to ensuring that this new information is incorporated into our planning process for this project. The type of collaboration described by my colleague from Florida will ensure that resources are wisely spent by utilizing and expanding monitoring programs already in operation. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000919\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the future of U.S. trade relations with China and the impending vote on China's PNTR status. The prosperity that this nation has enjoyed for the past 50 years has been a result of our commitment to free trade and opening markets. Free trade benefits all--it enhances prosperity and develops markets, essential elements to the spread of freedom, democracy, and the rule of law. China's entry into the World Trade Organization will also enhance American competitiveness, further our national interests, and benefit our trading partners. But we must enter into this agreement with our eyes open. China must comply with this agreement for it to have meaning. The United States must vigilantly seek enforcement of all agreements with China, including those addressing national security and human rights. \\n   I share the concern of my colleague, Senator THOMPSON, regarding China's proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. On August 9th of this year, the Director of Central Intelligence reported that China remained a ``key supplier'' of weapons technology and increased-missile related assistance to Pakistan as recently as the second half of 1999. In the last year it has been reported that China transferred missile technology to Libya and North Korea and may still be providing secret technical assistance to Pakistan's nuclear program. U.S. Intelligence has also provided evidence that the PRC has provided Iran with nuclear technology, chemical weapons materials, and missile technology that would violate China's commitment to observe the MTCR and U.S. laws. I do not suggest that because of these violations we should cut off trade with China, but we must address the fact that they are supplying rogue nations with weapons of mass destruction. This threat to our national security has made my decision on this vote a difficult one, and that has been compounded by my concerns with China's repeated human rights abuses. \\n   I suspect that each of my colleagues has had some opportunity over the years to hear about the human rights abuses taking place in China. I think one of the more eloquent spokesmen for the struggle for freedom has been Wei Jingsheng. He reminds us that those of us who live in the luxury of freedom should not forget those who are still struggling for liberty and freedom. \\n   Mr. President, because of these very strong conflicting views, the importance of open and free trade on the one hand, and the importance of human dignity and the pursuit of freedom on the other, this has been a difficult decision for me. But, after due consideration, I conclude that moving toward open and free markets advances freedom in China, so long as China is willing to abide by the rules of the WTO. \\n   By exposing China to global competition and the benefits it has to offer, Chinese leaders will be both obligated and empowered to more quickly move their country toward full economic reform. And by virtue of their business relationships, over time the Chinese people will be exposed to information, ideas and debate from around the world. This in turn will encourage them and their leadership to embrace the virtue and promise of individual freedom. The reason I am willing to embrace it has much has to do with the kinds of changes we have seen taking place in China over the years. If they were still committed to the ideology of the 1950's and 1960's, I do not think we would be here today. But, they have clearly moved toward opening their economy, and we should continue to push to open the country to freedom. \\n   So I think it is time for us to respond to these changes by saying to the Chinese people--we want to be engaged in free trade and competition with you. I think, in the end, humanity will benefit. So I will cast a vote in favor of this legislation. \\n   Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000727\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 11 a.m., for those Senators who wish to make final statements in remembrance of our former friend and colleague, Senator PAUL COVERDELL. \\n   Following morning business, Senator designate Zell Miller will be sworn in to serve as United States Senator. After the ceremony and a few remarks, the Senate will proceed to a cloture vote on the motion to proceed to the energy and water appropriations bill. At the conclusion of the vote, the Senate will proceed to the consideration of the conference report to accompany the Department of Defense appropriations bill, with a vote to occur at approximately 3:15 p.m. For the remainder of the day, the Senate is expected to begin postcloture debate on the motion to proceed to the energy and water appropriations bill. \\n   It is hoped that a vote on cloture on the motion to proceed to the PNTR China legislation can be moved to occur at a time to be determined during today's session. I thank my colleagues for their attention. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000727\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I understand there are two bills at the desk due for their second reading. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-20000727\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I object to further proceedings on these bills at this time. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000727\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I, too, express my appreciation for the beautiful words of the Senator from West Virginia this morning. And to Father Acker: On behalf of the entire Senate, we welcome you today and appreciate greatly your words of prayer. \\n   This is a special day for all of us, as the Senator from Nevada indicated. We will be swearing in a new Senator from Georgia. We do so with heavy hearts, however. \\n   I seek recognition now for a few moments to say a few words on the life of our colleague, Senator PAUL COVERDELL. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000727\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, the 10 days since his sudden passing and the outpouring of expression from many different directions have given me the opportunity to reflect on PAUL's life, the gifts he brought to the Senate, and the impact his life had on people. \\n   I want to focus my remarks on PAUL COVERDELL's humility, which I think was his defining quality, his greatest gift, and one which had the greatest impact on the lives of others. \\n   Many people might say that humility, sometimes defined as freedom from pride or arrogance, is a quality not found often in our society today. No one disputes, however, that PAUL COVERDELL possessed a deep sense of humility. \\n   During the past 10 days, PAUL COVERDELL has been described as: Serious and low key; self-effacing; uncomfortable in the limelight; a humble public servant who became a political giant through selfless dedication and quiet civility; a very gentle and courteous person; a person people went to, felt really comfortable with, and opened up to; a person who really cared for what happened to others; a person many regarded as the Senate's leading mediator; a person of scrupulous integrity and unblemished character; a person with an unsurpassed work ethic and standard of personal ethics and devotion to what he was doing; a person who always kept his word and was someone you could count on--just to mention a few characterizations. \\n   How many of us would like to be known as individuals who possess these qualities? \\n   Too often we think success results from aggressive, enterprising, pushy, and contentious behavior. In the case  of \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000727\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I would like to engage the chairman of the Appropriations Committee and my colleague from Florida in a brief colloquy concerning the South-Florida based Advanced Tropical Remote Sensing Center and its Synthetic Aperture Radar [SAR] facility. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-20000727\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I am very pleased to have this confirmation, and to know the Senators' personal interest and support. As the Senator is aware, one of our major objectives for this center, an objective supported by the leadership of SOUTHCOM, is to greatly enhance our nation's drug traffic interdiction capability. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-3-20000727\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, it was for the purpose of securing a clarification of their intent on this matter that I sought this colloquy. I thank them for their support, interest, and leadership. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000717\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I would like to join my colleague in thanking Senators GORTON and BYRD and the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee for their support for the Archie Carr National Wildlife Refuge. Twenty percent of all loggerhead sea turtle and 35% of all green sea turtle nests in the United States occur in this twenty mile zone. Nesting densities of 1,000 nests per mile have been recorded. Approximately half of this area is available for acquisition. The funds in this legislation will be critical in our ability to move forward on these acquisitions. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000714\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues to join us to reduce the marriage penalties in the tax code. This bill will provide married couples the relief that President Clinton denied them last year with his veto of the Taxpayer Refund and Relief Act of 1999. President Clinton's action last year increased taxes by close to $800 billion and imposed a marriage penalty on middle class American families. \\n   There is no place in the Tax Code for marriage penalties. Marriage penalties are caused by tax laws that treat joint filers relatively worse than single filers with half the income. It has of late become common practice to use the Tax Code for purposes of social engineering, discouraging some actions with the stick of tax penalties and encouraging others with the carrot of tax preferences. But there is no legitimate policy reason for punishing taxpayers with higher taxes just because they happen to be married. The marriage penalties in the Tax Code undermine the family, the institution that is the foundation of our society. \\n   I view this bill as just a start. Our Tax Code will not truly be family-friendly until every single marriage penalty is rooted out and eliminated, so that married couples with twice the income of single individuals are taxed at the same rates, and are eligible for the same tax preferences--including deductions, exemptions, use of IRAs and other savings vehicles--as those single filers. This bill is an important step toward that ultimate goal. \\n   The Democrat criticisms of our bill are misplaced. They argue that our bill contains complicated phase-ins, in contrast to their simple approach. But anyone who reads the bill and their alternative would see that this is false. The Finance Committee bill contains percentages in it, sure enough. And it phases in the relief, that is true. But the percentages and the phase-ins are instructions to the Treasury and the IRS, to make adjustments to the tax brackets. The only people who have to make any new calculations under the Finance Committee bill are the bureaucrats who make up the tax tables, not the taxpayer.  \\n   By contrast, the Democrat alternative, in phasing in its relief, requires taxpayers to calculate their taxes as joint filers, then calculate their taxes as if they were single--a complicated process that requires the allocation of various deductions and credits. Next, the taxpayer would have to determine the difference between these two calculations and then reduce this by a certain percentage. That is supposed to be simple? The Democrat substitute adds to the headaches of tax filing and the demand for tax preparers and tax preparation software. \\n   The Democrats also complain that the Finance Committee bill does more than address their narrow definition of the marriage penalty. They invoke the so-called ``marriage bonus.'' But the ``marriage bonus'' is a red herring. What they call a ``marriage bonus'' results from adjusting tax brackets for joint filers to reflect the fact that two adults are sharing the household income. Under the Democrat approach, single taxpayers who marry a non-working or low-earning spouse should pay the same amount of taxes as when they were single, even though this income must be spread over the needs of two adults. \\n   This approach is fundamentally flawed. The Democrat approach would enshrine in the law a new ``homemaker penalty.'' The Democrats would make families with one earner and one stay-at-home spouse pay higher taxes than families with the same household income and two earners. \\n   But why discriminate against one-earner families? Why would we want a tax code that penalized families just because one of the spouses chooses the hard work of the household over the role of breadwinner? The Democrat alternative discourages parents from staying home with their infant children, and penalizes a person who works longer hours so that a spouse can care for elderly parents. That is just plain wrong. \\n   The Finance Committee bill reduces the marriage penalty in a rational, sensible way, by making the standard deduction for joint filers twice what it is for single filers, and by making the ranges at which income is taxed at the 15 percent and 28 percent rates twice for joint filers what they are for single filers. This recognizes that marriage is a partnership in which two adults share the household income. Our approach cuts taxes for all American families. The Democrats call this a ``bonus.'' We call it common sense. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000713\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues to vote to bury the death tax once and for all. This tax is anti-family and anti-capitalist, smothers the American Dream, and is rationalized only by the greed of government and envy of success. \\n   The debate over death tax repeal highlights, as much as any issue that we will consider, a fundamental difference in philosophy among members of this body, and between the Republican Congress and the current Administration. We in the majority believe that the federal government has no right to claims the lion's share of any person's wealth just because that person had the misfortune of dying. The proponents of the death tax think otherwise. \\n   At the root of this philosophical difference are two vastly different views of the nature of wealth creation and its role in society. The supporters of the death tax seem to harbor a pessimistic, zero-sum view of wealth--the belief that every dollar saved by one person is one less dollar for the rest of us. This belief makes it easier to argue that a ceiling be placed on the level of wealth attained by any individual or family in America--people justify the confiscation of wealth above this level by attacking as greedy any family that seeks to accumulate more at the expenses of the rest of society. \\n   But this view is flawed. There is no finite limit to the amount of wealth that can be created in a society. People become wealthy in a market economy by satisfying the wants of others. Wealth is not a windfall to people with natural intelligence or ability, or who happen to stumble across valuable resources; it is created by providing consumers the goods, materials, and services that they desire at a price that does not exceed their estimate of its value. \\n   When one understands this concept, the death tax cannot be justified. If Bill Gates had chosen a career as a government bureaucrat instead of being a software entrepreneur, the tens of billions of dollars he has amassed in wealth would not have been distributed to others in society--instead, this fortune would never have been generated. It came about because Mr. Gates has provided goods and services to the public that they valued as much or more than the price he charged. Every voluntary exchange between that free individuals in a market economy creates wealth, and the businesses that provide the most consumer satisfaction will create the most wealth. When those goods and services are not offered, this wealth is not created, and everyone in society is poorer because their preferred choice does not exist. \\n   Proponents of the death tax argue that the heirs and legatees of an individual's fortune did nothing to deserve this bounty. Since it is a windfall to these individuals, why shouldn't the government get a piece of the action? Some death tax supporters go one step further, and have argued on this very floor that, unlikely the heirs, the government has a claim to this wealth because it is responsible for the prosperous American economic environment. This argument amounts to the claim that, since government refrains from confiscating property while people are alive, the government is entitled to confiscate upon death. \\n   It makes no sense to terminate property rights at death as the price to pay for their protection while living. The inheritors of property have a right to the property not because of anything they have done, but because it is the will of the decedent. If people cannot leave to their family and friends the wealth they create, they lose the incentive to create it. The higher the rate of death tax falling on their estate, the smaller, the motive to invest in and build a business. The inheritors of property have earned the right to receive it, because they served as the motivation behind the creation of wealth beyond what decedents would consume in their respective lifetimes. \\n   It has been estimated that the death tax will cost the economy almost one trillion dollars over the next decade and almost 275,000 jobs in large part because it robs people of the incentive to invest. I regularly receive letters from older constituents explaining that they have no desire to reinvest profits in their business only to have the government claim 55 percent of the business's increase in value. I am sure all of my colleagues receive similar \\n   letters. \\n   The death tax robs people of the incentive to build up their businesses, smothering the American Dream. The death tax eliminates the jobs that these discouraged entrepreneurs would have created. The death tax reduces the savings pool, reducing capital investments and reducing future productivity. The death tax reduces the choices of goods and services available to consumers. And, perhaps worst of all, the death tax places the interest of government over that of families. \\n   Why do we have to impose a tax upon death? Every person spends a lifetime paying taxes on the earnings from which their life savings comes. The income from inherited assets, such as stock dividends or business profits, will be taxed as it is earned. And, under our death tax repeal bill, any capital gain above the exemption amount will result in capital gains taxes when the asset is actually sold. Why the hurry to impose a tax at the time of death, a tax which forces families to sell land, personal property, and business interests that had been in the family for generations? \\n   The only reasons are the greed of the government and the death tax supporters' disapproval of inherited wealth. Under current law, the federal government will be collecting over $4 trillion more in taxes than it is budgeted to spend in the next decade alone. It is the federal government that needs a limit to its ability to enjoy the fruits of the hard work of our taxpayers, not the families of these taxpayers. \\n   The supporters of the death tax seem genuinely puzzled that the American people, in poll after poll, overwhelmingly support repeal of the death tax. They cannot understand why do many people would oppose a tax that directly affects so few. But the American people understand economics much better than the death taxers. They recognize the loss of jobs and opportunity. They also harbor in their hearts the dream that one day they, too, might be so successful as to amass the wealth that is subject to the confiscatory rates of the death tax. But, most of all, they recognize that a tax may be unfair even though it targets a small segment of the population--indeed, a tax may be unfair because it does so. This part of the American spirit does not seem to be appreciated by the death taxers. \\n   Mr. President, the specter of the federal death tax should no longer hover over our citizens, waiting to swoop down and confiscate the savings that has taken a lifetime to build. I urge all of my colleagues to vote for the Death Tax Elimination Act. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000630\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Will the Chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations Subcommittee yield for a question? \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-20000630\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I was most pleased to see that the Senate report accompanying this bill urged the Department to act in a timely manner to issue a Notice of Proposed Rule Making to include psychology into the Graduate Medical Education program. As you know, the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways & Means Committee have been working with the Department of Health and Human Services on this matter since 1997. Both the Conference Report on the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (Report 105-217 issued on July 30, 1997) and the Conference Report on last year's Omnibus bill (Report 106-479 issued on November 18, 1999) urged the Department to act favorably on this matter. In fact last year's Conference Report urged the Secretary to issue Notice of Rule Making to accomplish this modification before June 1, 2000. \\n   Mr. President, we thank you for including language in your report--Report 106-292--to further support this effort. I am saddened to report that the advice the Appropriations Committee has given the Secretary is being given little notice, just like all the previous requests to her on this matter. Mr. President, at this point, I would request unanimous consent that a letter I wrote to Secretary Shalala, along with Senator GRAHAM, Congressman SHAW, and Congresswoman THURMAN on April 27, 1998 be published in the RECORD, following this colloquy. \\n   Mr. President, many letters have been written to the Secretary and Nancy Ann Min DeParle, the Administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration, on this subject. Language has been included in two Finance/Ways & Means Conference Reports on this subject. Language has been included in the L-HHS Report. Despite all of these urgings, the desired result has not been produced. Would the Chairman of the Subcommittee consider including bill language in the final bill mandating this action if the Department has not issued the Notice of Proposed Rule Making by the time the Subcommittee goes to Conference with the House. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-3-20000630\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I thank the Chairman for his response to our inquiry. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000628\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr, President, as many of my colleagues are aware, cancer has played a prominent role in my family's history. Some in our family--me, my wife Priscilla, our daughter Debbie--have been lucky enough to have fought cancer and won. Others in our family have not been so lucky. My father died of esophageal cancer, my mother died of kidney cancer and my younger brother Michael died of melanoma at the very young age of thirty-five. \\n   As a result, Priscilla and I have become very active in the fight against cancer and in spreading the message that early detection saves lives. It's a part of who we are as a family. \\n   And there are other families with their own stories. Michael J. Fox and his family are waging war against Parkinson's disease. Mary Tyler Moore and her family are fighting diabetes. Christopher Reeve and his family are searching for a cure to paralysis. And millions of other families across the United States are fighting their own battles against AIDS, sickle-cell anemia, Lou Gehrig's disease, Alzheimer's and the many, many other diseases that take our loved ones away from us. \\n   What I've come to realize in my fight against cancer is the crucial role the federal government plays in funding basic medical research at the National Institutes of Health, and how important basic research is to finding breakthroughs not just for cancer but for all of the diseases which affect our families. \\n   For several years now, doubling funding at NIH has been a primary goal of mine in the Senate. The Federal Government, mainly through the NIH, funds about 36 percent of all biomedical research in this country, and plays an especially large role in basic research. \\n   Recently, the Joint Economic Committee, released a first-of-its kind study: ``The Benefits of Medical Research and the Role of the NIH,'' which examines how funding for the NIH cuts the high economic costs of disease, reduces suffering from illness, and helps Americans live longer, healthier lives. And I'd like to take a moment, Mr. President, to share with my colleagues some of the findings in this extensive report. \\n   According to the JEC, the economic costs of illness in the U.S. are huge--approximately $3 trillion annually, or 31 percent of the nation's GDP. This includes the costs of public and private health care spending, and productivity losses from illness. Medical research can reduce \\n   these high costs. But, the NIH is fighting this $3 trillion battle with a budget of $16 billion. That's just half of a percent of the total economic cost of disease in the United States. \\n   In addition to lowering the economic costs of illness, advances in medical research greatly help people live longer and healthier lives. A recent study found that longevity increases have created ``value of life'' gains to Americans of about $2.4 trillion every year. A  significant portion of these longevity gains stem from NIH-funded research in areas such as heart disease, stroke and cancer. If just 10 percent of the value of longevity increases, $240 billion, resulted from NIH research, that would mean a return of $15 for every $1 invested in NIH. \\n   Also according to the JEC, NIH-funded research helped lead to the development of one-third of the top 21 drugs introduced over the last few decades. These drugs treat patients with ovarian cancer, AIDS, hypertension, depression, herpes, various cancers, and anemia. Future drug research holds great promise for curing many diseases and lowering the costs of illness by reducing hospital stays and invasive surgeries. In fact, one study found that a $1 increase in drug expenditures reduces hospital costs by about $3.65. \\n   We know that past medical advances have dramatically reduced health care costs for such illnesses as tuberculosis, polio, peptic ulcers, and schizophrenia. For example, the savings from the polio vaccine, which was introduced in 1955, still produces a $30 billion savings per year, every year. \\n   Medical advances will help cut costs by reducing lost economic output from disability and premature death. For example, new treatments for AIDS--some developed with NIH-funded research--caused the mortality rate from AIDS to drop over 60 percent in the mid-1990s, thus allowing tens of thousands of Americans to continue contributing to our society and economy. \\n   And medical research spending isn't just about reducing the enormous current burdens of illness. The costs of illness may grow even higher if we fail to push ahead with further research. Infectious diseases, in particular, are continually creating new health costs. The recent emergence of Lyme disease, E. coli, and hantavirus, for example, show how nature continues to evolve new threats to health. In addition, dangerous bacteria are evolving at an alarming rate and grow resistant to every new round of antibiotics. \\n   This report extensively shows the benefits of medical research and reaffirms the enormous benefits we achieve from funding the National Institutes of Health in our fight against disease. But there is still a lot more work to be done. I am hopeful my colleagues will take a few moments to look at this report and recognize the important work done by the scientists and researchers at the NIH. It can be read in its entirety on the JEC website at: jec.senate.gov. \\n   Funding for NIH is really about-- hope and opportunity. The challenge before us is great, but America has always responded when our people are behind the challenge. America landed a man on the moon. We pioneered computer technology. America won the Cold War. Now it is time to win the war against the diseases that plague our society. We have the knowledge. We have the technology. Most important, we have the support of the American people. \\n   I ask my colleagues to join me in the effort to double funding for the National Institutes of Health. It's good economic policy, it's good public policy, and most importantly, it's good for all Americans. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000627\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support for the Everglades restoration bill introduced today by my friend, and chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator BOB SMITH. This bill represents a tremendous amount of effort and hard work and I am grateful to all my colleagues who have joined Senator GRAHAM and me in this effort. \\n   Today is an important day in the nearly twenty-year process of restoring America's Everglades. It is important because we are standing at last at the historic juncture between planning and action. It is important because now--at long last--we have a realistic chance of restoring, and protecting for future generations, a unique environmental treasure that is fractured, starved for water, and locked in a steady state of decline. And it is important because the bill we're introducing today represents the cumulative efforts of all those who did the work on the largest and most significant environmental restoration project in our nation's history. \\n   Why does this bill matter? Why are the Everglades deserving of Congress' time and effort? Let me offer a few reasons. This bill matters because in the last century a wonderful, pristine natural system in the heart of South Florida was systematically robbed of its beauty and uniqueness in the name of short-term human interest. This bill matters because the America's Everglades is a national treasure, unique in the world, and deserving of a better fate than what is currently written for it in the laws of this country. Our bill matters because we Floridians--after years of acrimony and conflicting goals--have come together behind a balanced plan that fully reconciles the needs of the natural system with those  of the existing water users. And the restoration matters--to us, as legislators--because past Congresses caused this problem, and we in our generation should fix it. \\n   It has been well documented how the Congress in 1948--acting under the pressures of the day--authorized the systematic destruction of the Everglades in the name of flood control, urban development, and agriculture. That is history and we cannot change that. Instead, we must respond to the needs and priorities of our own generation, and pass this good bill to restore America's Everglades. \\n   Let's be clear, Mr. President. Passing this bill, this year, is all that remains between the long years of study and the actual restoration of America's Everglades. The administration has done their part in devoting a tremendous amount of time and effort on the document before you. To Governor Bush's credit, the State of Florida has already written this plan into Florida's laws and arranged funding for Florida's share of the cost. There is only one task remaining: we in Congress must pass this plan, this year, and let the work of restoration begin. \\n   I urge my colleagues to join with me in supporting the bill we're introducing today. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000620\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I begin by saying to my friend, Senator DODD, how much I appreciate his comments at the beginning of his speech to the Senate. I appreciate the relationship we have developed. Certainly, one of the things I will truly miss as I leave the Senate at the end of this year is the relationships that have been developed and the opportunity to expand on those relationships with others. Again, it has been a delight. However, we do have very strong differences of opinion on this issue. \\n   I will begin by pointing at the chart that has been put up next to Senator DODD. There is one very fundamental difference. Each of those leaders reached out; they wanted to bring about change. We have seen absolutely, positively none of that from Fidel Castro. There is no indication--not an iota of evidence--that Fidel Castro wants to change. \\n   Later today, we will be voting on this amendment to the Defense Department authorization bill, which is designed to establish a commission to review and report on the United States policy toward Cuba. \\n   I have spoken with many colleagues recently about this amendment and the idea of forming a commission. I understand from some Senators that they have concerns that they want a chance to discuss regarding Cuba. But the goal of those Senators seems to be either broad sanctions reform or the enactment of specific changes in our policies toward Cuba. But today we are debating an amendment on forming a commission. \\n   This commission is blatantly political, in my opinion, so much so that no serious effort can come from a commission designed to be so skewed. This commission accomplishes nobody's goal. \\n   Let me make three points: First, we don't need a national commission to study only Cuba sanctions; second, we should not tie the hands of the next President to set his own Cuba policy; and, third, we should not set policy through a partisan commission outside of the normal conduct of foreign policy by the executive branch. \\n   The legislation on which you are being asked to vote establishes a 12-person panel to review and report on various aspects of Cuba policy. But this is why we have a Foreign Relations Committee in the Senate, an International Relations Committee in the House, and a U.S. Department of State. Why are we making Government bigger and more expensive than it needs to be? Especially, as my friend from Connecticut has argued, this amendment does not take a position or implement a policy.  \\n   Let me highlight a few of the details. This commission is appointed as follows--and, again, I note that my friend indicated this is not a partisan issue, but we who have been around here for a long time all know these issues end up being influenced by politics. \\n   What we are going to have is a commission of 12 people, 6 appointed by the current President. The current President will put six members on a commission to tell the next President what his policy toward Cuba should be. And there will be three from each House--two majority, one minority. That means two-thirds of the commission would be appointed by Democrats; that is, 8 of the 12 members of the commission would be appointed by Democrats. One-third, that is, four members of the commission, would be Republicans. That is not the way to set foreign policy. \\n   Our current policy, set by the State Department and the President, has been endorsed by the Congress over the years with significant legislation. The only reason for this special commission is to try to change current policy through abnormal means. \\n   Let me talk for a moment about American foreign policy in general. I hear the rhetoric often that, after 39 years, clearly, our Cuba policy has not brought democracy to Cuba and therefore it must be abandoned as a failure. Think about that argument for a moment. What if Ronald Reagan had come into office and declared in 1980: After 40 years, since there is no democracy in the Soviet Union, our Soviet policy must be abandoned? \\n   Reagan did the opposite. He had the courage to call the Soviet Union what it was, an ``evil empire.'' His courage and commitment brought democratic reform to Russia. America's foreign policy must reflect America's commitment to the principles we believe in: freedom, democracy, justice, and respect for human dignity. \\n   My friend from Connecticut has stated that the policy is aimed at one man, Fidel Castro, but it denies basic necessities to the entire 11 million people of Cuba. The reality is that Cuba can purchase goods from the entire world. By closing the American market to Cuba, we are denying the people nothing. Fidel Castro keeps Cuba poor, not the United States embargo. \\n   By maintaining the current policy, however, of isolating Fidel Castro, we are doing as a Nation what we have done for so many generations: We are standing shoulder to shoulder with \\n   people struggling for freedom. We are standing for truth and dignity and supporting heroes when we oppose Fidel Castro and deny him the means to build up his resources. \\n   Since trade has been an important issue of discussion lately given the pending vote on trade with China, perhaps some more detail would be helpful on the differences between China and Cuba. \\n   Simply stated, China began policy changes and economic reforms as early as 1978. Today, they continue to open their economy, seek engagement in the community of nations, and look for investment and trade. \\n   Let me tell you about Cuba. I will provide details from a study conducted by the University of Miami: Cuba does not permit trade independent from the state; most of Cuba's exportable products to the United States are produced by Cuban state-run enterprises with workers being paid near slave wages; many of these products would compete unfairly with United States agriculture and manufactured products, or with other products imported from the democratic countries of the Caribbean into the United States; Cuba does not permit individual freedom in economic matters; investments in Cuba are directed and approved by the Government of Cuba; it is illegal for foreign investors to hire or fire Cuban workers directly and the Cuban Ministry of Labor does the hiring; foreign companies must pay the wages owed to their employees directly to the Cuban Government in hard currency; the Cuban Government then pays the workers in Cuban pesos, worth one-twentieth of a dollar, and the Government pockets 90 percent of the wages paid in by the investor; Cuba has no independent judicial system to settle commercial disputes. \\n   In short, Fidel Castro has failed to make any of the changes made by Beijing. An investment in China today can empower a Chinese middle class and move power away from the center. An investment in Cuba today benefits Fidel Castro and disadvantages the 11 million people struggling for freedom. It is that simple. \\n   As recently as 1997, Fidel Castro argued against the wisdom of economic reforms and reasserted the supremacy of Communist ideology. In addition, political parties remain outlawed. Dissidents are either exiled, banished to the far reaches of the island, or simply imprisoned. The church continues to complain that the promises made during the Pope's visit have not been complied with. The daily activities of the average Cuban citizen continue to be monitored by the state's notorious ``neighborhood watch committees,'' known as the Committee for the Defense of the Revolution. These have been in place for 40 years and continue in place today. Amnesty International counts at least 400 prisoners of conscience, but this does not include the thousands convicted under trumped up charges for political purposes. \\n   I am not simply arguing ideology here today. We have empirical evidence of the failure of the policy recommendation to trade with Cuba; we need only to look at Canada's recent experiences. After arguing for a policy of opening trade with Cuba, our neighbors to the North are now pulling out. I will quote from The Globe and Mail of June 30, 1999:  \\n   The Canadian government had hoped that investing directly in the Cuban economy by building plants and infrastructure would not only deliver an economic return, but also lead to wider-ranging reforms. Those hopes have been largely dashed as Canadian companies report woeful tales of pouring good money into bad investments in Cuba.  \\n   Mr. President, policies of so-called engagement with Castro have failed for those who have tried. We all shared great hope when the Pope visited Cuba in January 1998. The United States promised to respond positively to any changes made by the Castro regime following the Pope's visit. We expected to see more space for the Cuban people: freedom of speech and more freedom of religious expression. We know now that even these hopes have been dashed. The Pope just last December expressed his disappointment in the changes in Cuba. A December 2, 1999 Reuters wire story reports,  \\n   The clear wording of the Pope's speech indicated that the Vatican felt that not much has changed on the predominantly Catholic island in two years.  \\n   We know that President Reagan's wisdom remains true--after 39 years of isolating Cuba, we must not fear calling things as we see them. Fidel Castro is an evil tyrant. He impoverishes the Cuban people in spite of the efforts of many to open the society to freedom and the economy to investment. Fidel Castro denies his people the basic necessities for life, liberty, and happiness. \\n   Mr. President, I do not object to evaluating our policies, but we must be honest, this is not the way. When Cuba changes, the United States must also change. Until then, we must remain committed to our principles, because it is our principles which make us strong. No missile system, no fleet of warships, will keep the United States the shining city on the hill--the beacon of freedom which we all saw when Ronald Reagan was President. I hope that my colleagues will join me. And I hope that they will stand with me for freedom. stand with me for democracy, stand with me for justice, and stand with me for respect for the human dignity of the 11 million people in Cuba. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-20000620\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I merely seek recognition to move to table the Dodd amendment No. 3475, and I ask for the yeas and nays. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-3-20000620\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I understand that vote will take place at 3:15 p.m. among three stacked votes, I believe. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000620\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote to table this amendment. It is blatantly political in its nature. Of the 12 positions, 8 will be determined by the Democratic Party and 4 by the Republicans; 6 by the President, 2 by the majority in each of the Houses, 1 by the  minority in each. That is 8 of 12--two-thirds. \\n   We should not, today, be telling the next President of the United States what his policy should be with respect to Cuba. This Congress and this President should not be doing that. \\n   Third, I only had the opportunity to speak with Frank Carlucci and Howard Baker. While they accept the concept of a commission, they don't support one that is so blatantly political, and they don't support one being established at this time. \\n   I ask my colleagues to vote against this amendment, and I move to table the amendment. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000616\\n\\n    Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a common sense piece of legislation that would prohibit the rescheduling or forgiveness of any outstanding bilateral debt owed to the United States by the Government of the Russian Federation until the President of the United States certifies to the Congress that Russia has ceased all operations and permanently closed its intelligence facility at Lourdes, Cuba. Currently the Government of the Russian Federation maintains a signals intelligence facility in Lourdes, Cuba from which it conducts intelligence activities directed against the United States. The Secretary of Defense has reported that the Russian Federation leases the Lourdes facility for an estimated $100 to $300 million every year. This is several hundred million dollars flowing to support a brutal tyrant for the purpose of supporting espionage. \\n   Mr. President, the United States should prohibit debt rescheduling and forgiveness for a country that is conducting espionage activities against America, while infusing Castro's despotic government with between $100 million and $300 million per year. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000612\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise with my friend and colleague Senator GRAHAM to introduce the Florida Keys Water Quality Improvements Act. This bill is identical to legislation that passed the House on May 4, 2000 by a vote of 411-7, and would provide Federal resources to help improve and maintain one of our Nation's real treasures, the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. \\n   The Florida Keys are a spectacular natural resource of international significance. Within the Florida Keys lies the only living coral reef bed in the United States and the third largest living coral reef in the world. The reef is home to plants and animals unique to this area and that comprise a rare and sensitive ecosystem at the southern end of the Everglades ecosystem. While the spectacular coral reef is the Keys' most popular feature, they are also known for native seagrass beds, lush tropical hardwood hammocks, mangrove forests, rocky pinelands, the endangered key deer, and a wide array of aquatic life. \\n   The Florida Keys marine ecosystem is dependent upon clean, clear water with low nutrient levels for its survival. Water quality experts have found that the inadequate wastewater treatment and storm water management systems are major contributors of pollution in the nearby waters off the Florida Keys. This increased pollution has had devastating effects on the marine environment, and is threatening the reefs on the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. Unless decisive action is taken to stop the flow of pollution, scientists warn the ecosystem will continue its decline towards total collapse. \\n   The source of the problem is clear. The Keys have almost no water quality infrastructure. Lacking adequate technology, untreated wastewater now travels easily through porous limestone rock into the near-shore waters. Polluted stormwater also flows from developed land into the same near-shore waters. \\n   Our bill is a natural extension of the Federal commitment to the Florida Keys made under the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary Protection Act approved by Congress in 1990. This legislation established a Federal role in the research and protection of the Keys marine ecosystem. The Act directed the Environmental Protection Agency and the State of Florida to establish a Water Quality Steering Committee which was charged with developing a comprehensive water quality protection program. In fulfilling this directive, the steering committee worked closely with dedicated citizens, scientists, and technical experts. In the final analysis, it found that inadequate wastewater and stormwater systems are the single largest source of pollution in the Keys. \\n   This bill authorizes Federal assistance to help local officials afford the necessary improvements to protect the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. It establishes a grant program under the Environmental Protection Agency for the construction of treatment works projects aimed at improving the water quality of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. The administrator of EPA, after consultation with State and local officials, would be authorized to fund treatment works projects that comply or are consistent with local growth ordinances, plans and agreements, as well as current water quality standards. Projects funded under this program would be cost-shared, with local sponsors providing a minimum of 25 percent of the project costs. \\n   This bill authorizes $213 million in Federal funding for the deployment of water quality technology throughout the Keys. To make the necessary wastewater improvements, the estimated cost to improve near-shore water quality in the Florida Keys is between $184 million and $418 million. To make the necessary storm water management improvements, the estimated cost is between $370 million and $680 million. The Federal government is not going to bear the entire cost, even though this is a national resource. The State of Florida is obligated to come up with 25 percent cost share. \\n   Moneys authorized by this bill will be utilized to replace the dated, inefficient system of sludge ponds and septic tanks currently being used in the Keys with modern waste and storm water treatment works. By ensuring that the nutrients associated with such wastes are not discharged or released into the surrounding waters, we can prevent further damage to the marine environment and achieve dramatic improvement to the water quality in the National Marine Sanctuary. \\n   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this reasonable approach to maintaining an essential national resource. I hope there will be a broad, bipartisan support for this bill.  \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000524\\n\\n    Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000515\\n\\n    Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation I am introducing today with my colleague, Senator BREAUX, be printed in the RECORD. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000504\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I am glad to let my colleague go first. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-20000504\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, let me make just a couple of comments before I give my prepared remarks. \\n   It is interesting how this debate is being engaged rather vigorously so quickly and so early this morning. I remind my colleagues that this is basically this same amendment that was adopted by the Senate 63-35 in the last Congress. \\n   I imagine the reason for it is that all of my colleagues received a letter from the National Education Association, the teachers union, in opposition to this amendment. This letter from the National Education Association on behalf of its 2.5 million members strongly urges opposition to the amendment offered by Senator ABRAHAM and myself. They are opposed to it because it authorizes ``federal funds for [the purpose of] testing of current teachers, tenure reform, and merit pay.'' \\n   I find it interesting that the NEA previously came out in support of testing--NEA President Bob Chase has said the NEA:  \\n   ......wholeheartedly supports and endorses the recommendations of the National Commission on Teaching and America's Future's new report, ``Doing What Matters Most: Investing in Quality Teaching.''  \\n   The report recommends: Teachers should be licensed based on demonstrated performance, including tests of subject matter knowledge, teaching knowledge, and teaching skill. \\n   The report recommends: To encourage and reward teacher knowledge and skill, we should develop a career continuum for teaching linked to assessments and compensation systems that reward knowledge and skill. \\n   That sounds to me like a broad endorsement of the concept of testing teachers to understand where they are with respect to the knowledge they have in the courses they are going to be teaching. I think it clearly indicates the idea of moving away from pay being based on someone's seniority to one based on merit--pay should be based on the ability to teach, the ability to be able to show, in testing, that they have the knowledge in the areas in which they are teaching. \\n   So I make that comment to begin. \\n   Further, with respect to questions about merit pay, again, my colleague already referred to the fact there have been States experimenting with this idea since the late 1960s. But Denver, CO, has a merit pay system. Interestingly enough, the Secretary of Education, Secretary Riley, when he was Governor of South Carolina, endorsed merit pay. \\n   In Florida, we encourage teachers to participate in what I believe is the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards. If a teacher in the State of Florida successfully completes that process and becomes certified by this board, they are going to receive a bonus. I think that is merit pay. \\n   So this idea that I think the Senator from Massachusetts tried to imply, that this is something no one is pursuing and there is no value to it, I would say, is not accurate. \\n   Mr. President, I rise today with my friend and colleague, Senator ABRAHAM, to offer this critically important amendment. It focuses on the single most important, yet most overlooked, aspect of education--the quality of America's teachers. \\n   Education is the engine of social and economic progress, and the ladder of opportunity. The rungs of that ladder must be supported by exceptional teachers. I have little doubt that the American spirit of ingenuity and innovation will continue to lead the world in providing new economic opportunities, expanding medical research and improving the quality of life for everyone. But there is a catch. For our children and grandchildren to achieve the high standards we expect of them, we must provide them with the tools they need to help them excel. The economic security of our children depends upon the quality of their education. \\n   Each time we debate education reform in America, there is a growing sentiment that continued viability of the American dream could slip away simply because our children are unprepared to face tomorrow's challenges. The academic performance of America's students in international exams can hardly be considered world class. In fact, the longer our students attend American schools, the further behind they fall in performance. Consider these statistics: \\n   While America's 4th graders score above the international average in math tests, they continue to trail students in countries like Austria, the Czech Republic, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, and Singapore. By the 8th grade, American students barely meet the international average, and by the 12th grade, American students lag far behind their international peers. \\n   In science, U.S. students score above the international average in both 4th and 8th grades. But, in 4th grade, U.S. students are outranked by only one country--Korea. By the 8th grade, thirteen countries outrank U.S. students. \\n   Again, that is an indication that the longer they are in school, the further behind they fall with other countries in the world. \\n   In international physics tests, American 12th graders ranked sixteenth, and far behind countries like Russia, Slovenia, Latvia and the Czech Republic. \\n   In both math and science, the performance of U.S. 12th graders is among the lowest in the industrialized world. Of the 21 countries that participate, the United States placed 16th in science and 19th in math skills. \\n   Our students will be denied basic opportunities because they have not been adequately equipped to face a new, competitive, and global economy. We can and must do better. \\n   Without qualified teachers in America's classrooms, all other attempts at reform are meaningless. We have long focused on the need to hire more teachers--as many as two million over the next decade. Our focus shouldn't be on the number of teachers, but rather, on the quality of those teachers. \\n   As long as students are compelled to attend school, we should be compelled to staff those \\n   schools with the best and brightest teachers. Parents all over the state of Florida, and I imagine the same is true around the country, are concerned that the success--or failure--of their child's entire academic year will be determined by the quality and expertise of their child's teacher. Studies show that the most important factor in determining student success on standardized tests is the teacher's ability to present the material. As States are taking important steps to challenge their students with high-stakes tests for promotion and graduation, we must encourage states to step up to the plate and provide students with teachers who are better prepared than ever before. \\n   Further complicating the situation is the shortage of teachers nationwide, which has led many school districts to assign teachers to subjects for which they have no formal training. Four million American students are currently being taught English, Math, or History by teachers who have neither a college major or minor in the subject they are teaching. Four million kids! \\n   Mr. President, maybe I have a slightly different perspective in looking at these numbers today than I would have, say, 5 or 6 weeks ago. Priscilla and I were just blessed with our first granddaughter. We already have three grandsons, but this is our first granddaughter. While all of us in the family are engaged in the early days of raising that little baby and trying to get through the night, we are also concerned about the future for little Addison. Is she going to be among the one out of five students in America being taught English by a teacher who doesn't have a major or minor in English?  \\n   Think about that for a moment. I think one out of four math students are being taught by teachers who do not have a minor or major in that subject. So when I think about little Addison's future, and I realize the competitive world in which we live today, and how much more competitive it is going to be in the future, I know she is not going to be able to compete and have the same opportunities we all have enjoyed if she doesn't have an education second to none. Frankly, that can only come about as a result of having high-quality teachers in the classroom--teachers who my son and his wife, Ann, can be comfortable in knowing have the knowledge and expertise to provide that education. \\n   Requiring secondary school teachers to earn a major or minor in their subjects might make sense if there were not a clearly superior policy that could be adopted instead, such as requiring teachers to pass a subject knowledge test for the subject areas they teach. \\n   Teacher testing is an important first step toward upgrading the quality of instruction in the classroom. Testing provides a valuable opportunity for teachers to demonstrate knowledge of subjects for which they do not hold a major or minor degree. It will also enable principals to evaluate their staffing needs and to staff classrooms with the most qualified teachers. You simply \\n   can not teach what you don't know. \\n   Common sense also dictates that we should not focus solely on under-performing teachers. We must also recognize that there are many great teachers who are successfully challenging their students on a daily basis. Teaching is one of the most important and challenging professions. While many excellent, enthusiastic, and well prepared teachers already work in America's schools, their work often goes unrecognized and unrewarded. Salaries for teachers lag far behind other professions for which a college degree is expected or required, and as a result, many exceptional teachers leave the profession and others who would be exceptional teachers never even consider teaching. \\n   We have created a system of clear incentives for our best teachers to leave the classroom. Instead, we should be enacting policies to keep the best and brightest teachers in the classroom. To do this, we need to evaluate and reward teachers with a compensation system that supports and encourages them to strengthen their skills and demonstrate high levels of performance. That, in turn, will enhance learning for all children. \\n   Today, schools compensate teachers based almost solely on seniority, not on their performance inside the classroom. It rewards underperforming teachers and penalizes exceptional ones by grouping them together in a single pay scale based primarily upon length of service. Merit-pay would differentiate between teachers who are hard-working and inspiring, and those who fall short. It is true that good teachers cost money. But the fact is, bad teachers can cost more because they limit the education of a child and his or her ability to contribute to society. \\n   We hear quite often that merit pay won't work in public schools because it is too difficult to compare the accomplishments between teachers teaching smart, wealthy, well-disciplined, well-fed children versus those teaching poor, inattentive, hungry and unruly children. These conditions are no different than the differences faced by other professionals like doctors or lawyers who face both unwinnable cases or deadly diseases. Teachers should also be rewarded proportionately to their accomplishments in enhancing student learning, attitudes, and behavior. \\n   This is not to suggest that simply throwing more money at schools and teachers will rescue schools from mediocrity. Some suggest we try throwing more money at the problem, although I would point out that we have already tried that. The United States spends more money per pupil than any other industrialized nation, and as I mentioned earlier, our children are not achieving high levels of performance on international standardized exams. The reality is that no amount of money will save mismanaged, bureaucratic, red-tape ridden schools from failure. And no amount of money will rescue a student who is placed in a classroom led by an unprepared, unenthusiastic, and uninspiring teacher. This debate is less about money and more about giving teachers a greater stake in the education they provide. We can do this by offering them real incentives to do their best so that their dedication and expertise will be recognized and rewarded. This will benefit all students. \\n   Our amendment, known as the MERIT Act, will enable states to use their limited federal dollars on a number of initiatives to enhance teacher quality. First, this amendment provides funding for states to develop rigorous exams to periodically test elementary and secondary school teachers on their knowledge of the subjects they are teaching. Secondly, this amendment provides funding to states to establish compensation systems for teachers based upon merit and proven performance. Finally, this amendment provides states with resources to reform current tenure programs. \\n   This broad approach will enable states to staff their schools with the best and most qualified teachers, thereby enhancing learning for all students. In turn, teachers can be certain that all of their energy, dedication and expertise will be rewarded. And it will be done without placing new mandates on states or increasing the federal bureaucracy. \\n   Last Congress, the Senate passed a similar amendment with bipartisan support by a vote of 63-35 during debate on the Education Savings Account legislation. Unfortunately, the President vetoed that bill, despite his previous support for teacher testing. \\n   I look forward to working with my colleagues as we continue the fight to give dedicated professionals, who teach our children, a personal stake in the quality of the instruction they provide. I hope there will again be broad, bipartisan support for this amendment. I thank the chair and I yield the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-3-20000504\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, that is a story I remember very well. To cut it short takes away, I think, the strength of its message. So maybe a little bit later on in the debate we can discuss it, but I would be glad to yield the time back to the Senator so she can continue. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-4-20000504\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I thank the Senator for the opportunity to do this. A number of years ago, my wife and I visited a school called the Marcus Garvey School in Los Angeles. I went there because I was trying to learn more about the different types of schools in America--what works, what does not work. While I am going to be talking about the Marcus Garvey School, I am not endorsing or embracing everything the school does. But the thing that stood out to me was the role of the teacher in this school. So this is what happened. \\n   I went to the Marcus Garvey School and met the administrator, the principal, the owner of the school--all one person, Anyim Palmer, who was in a room probably no bigger than 10 by 10, filled with furniture that was probably 35 or 40 years old. The phone was on a stack of papers. There was no secretary. When the phone rang, he answered it. The point I am making is there were not a lot of amenities. This is basic stuff. This is a building with rooms in it, an administrator, teachers, and students. \\n   He said: I want to take you down and show you what some of our students are doing. Unfortunately, the school is not filled today because of the time of the year it is. \\n   Priscilla and I went down to a room where there were three different groups of children being taught in the same room. The first group of students we saw were 2-year-old children. Again, I emphasize 2-year-olds, not second graders; 2-year-old children. There were eight of them sitting at a little table. The teacher said to the children: Show the Senator and Mrs. Mack how you can say your ABCs. You can imagine the cute little voices of those children as they recited their ABCs. When they finished that, the teacher said: Now that you have done it in English, do it in Spanish. So then these little 2-year-old children went through their alphabet in Spanish. When they finished that, the teacher then said to them: Now do the alphabet in Swahili, and they did that as well--2 years old. \\n   We went across the room to where 3-year-old children were doing math problems. The teacher said to me: Give one of the students a math problem. As I would suspect most people would have done, I gave a problem such as 5 plus 8--you know, pretty straightforward. But, again, 3 years old. She  said: No, no, no, give them a tough problem. So I said something like 325 plus 182. And this 3-year-old child, standing at the board, put down little dots, wrote down a number, another series of dots, wrote down a number and got the right answer at 3-years-old. \\n   We went across the room where 4-year-old children were reading. We were told that these children were reading at the second, third, and fourth grade level. They were 4 years old. \\n   We went into another room in this facility where there were 5-year-old children. A little boy was asked to stand up and recite for me, in the proper chronological order, every President of the United States. That little fellow stood up, looked me right in the eyes, and he rattled right through every President of the United States in the proper order. I must admit I knew he did that because they gave me a cheat sheet to look at. He was 5 years old. \\n   Every time we went to a different area and saw these students, these children at work, Priscilla and I would say to this person who was taking us around: How can this be? How can this possibly be? What makes this work? Every single time we asked the question, the answer was: It is the teacher. It is \\n   the teacher. It is the teacher. \\n   Anyim Palmer challenged what was then considered the best private school in Los Angeles County, their sixth grade against his third grade students. I think it was in math and English. You know who won--Anyim Palmer's third grade beat the sixth graders. How did he do it? What he said to me was: It was the teacher. \\n   What I found out later is Anyim Palmer was a public school teacher in California who became so frustrated and angry that the system was failing to teach children in his community that he quit the public schools and started his own school. Do you know what he did? He also trained his own teachers. He said: Forget everything you have learned. I am going to train you. I am going to teach you how to teach. \\n   Again, I thank the Senator for asking me to restate that story. It made a major impression on me. We can talk about all these other things, but we must focus on how to make sure that the teacher standing up in front of our children and grandchildren has the knowledge in the subject they are teaching--this is not fancy. We are not asking for special degrees. I am asking a very simple question. If a teacher is standing in front of my little granddaughter, Addison, a few years from now, I want my son and his wife to know the person who is teaching their little daughter has the knowledge in the subject they are teaching. That does not seem to be an unreasonable request to make. \\n   I thank the Senator for asking the question. I yield. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-5-20000504\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I say to the Senator he is exactly right, there is no mandate. As strongly as I feel about it, I would like to, but I do not think that is our role. I think we can make some serious mistakes by mandating certain things, to say to a particular school district or a particular State they have to do what I say. They might say, what if we put this kind of testing program into effect but our concern is we need more computers. We need more books. We need--whatever. \\n   This is not a mandate. It never has been a mandate. It never will be a mandate, at least as far as the Senator from Michigan and I are concerned. It is merely a statement of importance and it says to the schools if they want to, these dollars can be used for the purpose of developing the concepts for creating tests, developing some merit pay program, or in reforming tenure, all three of which we think can in fact go to the heart of the matter about what is necessary to improve the ability of the teacher. \\n   The inference was made earlier that somehow or another those of us who are talking about this are out to degrade the teachers in this country. That is absolutely a false challenge. Most of us can remember those teachers who made a difference in our lives, who challenged us, who demanded from us that we do better. Each of us responded in a little bit different way. But we understand the importance of having good, quality teachers, and there are a lot of them. That is why we put the merit pay in, to recognize that. \\n   Again, as to this notion that somehow or another if we were to put in place a merit pay system that, highlights teachers who are doing well, and encourages those who are not teaching our children to do better and somehow or another people would know and there would be divisions that would take place, let me tell you something. There is probably not a school in America where every teacher doesn't know who is carrying the load and who is not. You do not need a merit pay program for students and teachers alike to know who the good teachers are. You can just hear the kids talking about it: Boy, I hope I don't get in so-and-so's class. \\n   It doesn't take a merit program. Merit pay is not going to do that. Children and parents already know the good ones and those who are not carrying their load. \\n   What we are trying to do is the right thing. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-6-20000504\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I certainly hope it would do that. I believe it would. As both of us have indicated, the State of Florida has developed a program that provides an incentive for teachers to get certification by a national board. If they receive that certification, they get a bonus. \\n   They also get a bonus if they encourage another teacher to do the same thing. \\n   What we are saying is, we are recognizing, not only through the dollars but through our interest, the importance of that individual teacher and the importance of the quality of that individual teacher. I believe it would encourage them to stay in the system longer. Most of the teachers love the children they are teaching. They want them to do better. We just need to give more encouragement to those teachers. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-7-20000504\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I suggest the absence of a quorum. \\n   Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-8-20000504\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I suggest the absence of a quorum.  \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000426\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000426\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, in the early morning hours of Holy Saturday, a little piece of America died. America's shining beacon of freedom faded in the Florida sky as many of us grieved over the astounding actions of the United States Government. This administration betrayed America's past and joined history's inglorious list of governments that have chosen to use excessive force against its own law-abiding citizens. \\n   Our founding fathers believed in a Government of, for, and by, the people, a Government designed to serve and benefit the people, not to serve and benefit the needs of Government, and certainly not to substitute brute force for the rule of law. These are reminiscent of the tactics used by tyrants and despots. The decisions by this administration that led to the events of last Saturday will be remembered as a day of shame in our American history. \\n   My comments today are not directed toward the law enforcement officers who carried out the operation; I understand they are charged with a duty and must follow the directives of the Attorney General and the President of the United States. My comments today are not directed at the ultimate disposition of Elian's residency or custody, and they are not intended to be partisan or political, but they do go directly to the heart of who we are as a Nation and what we expect of our Government. \\n   As most people know, the Elian Gonzalez matter is pending in Federal court. Just last Wednesday, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals ordered that Elian Gonzalez must remain in the United States during the review of his Federal court case. The opinion of the court suggests the INS and the Department of Justice were wrong in not granting Elian an asylum hearing. In the final footnote of the opinion, the court encouraged the parties to avail themselves voluntarily of the Eleventh Circuit's mediation services. The court believed that mediation was an appropriate avenue to resolve this heart gripping situation. \\n   The Attorney General did not listen to the court. She was obsessed with reuniting Elian with his father at any cost. Perhaps she would have been wise to listen to the words of Daniel Webster: ``Liberty exists in proportion to wholesome restraint.'' Perhaps she should have listened to her own words: ``I'm trying to work through an extraordinary human tragedy. And the importance of working through it is that we do so in good faith, without violence, without having to cause further disruption to the little boy.'' This statement was made nine days before the raid. \\n   The night before the raid, mediation between the Department of Justice, the Miami family and Juan Miguel Gonzalez had gone on all night and into the wee hours of Saturday morning. Even as the negotiations continued on the telephone with all parties, agents of the administration dressed in fatigues and masks exploded into the home of Lazaro Gonzalez with machine guns drawn--and one machine gun that was pointed dramatically in the face of a screaming child. \\n   The Government held all the power, and the Government used intimidation to force a family, a loving caring family, into a corner. Remember this is the family originally selected by the Attorney General to care for Elian. \\n   The administration offered ultimatums when fair mediation was needed. This administration resorted to the power of a machine gun to intimidate an American family. What possible benefit could come from this act? \\n   Tactics such as these deserve a full explanation. \\n   Why would the Department of Justice stage a raid when mediator Aaron Podhurst stated that a deal between the parties was ``minutes to an hour away''? Why would they be so impatient with a solution so near? The Attorney General said that they had a window during which to conduct the raid of Saturday through Monday. Why could they not have waited for negotiations to play out. \\n   What credible information existed to suggest this level of force needed to be used? \\n   Another question that deserves fuller explanation speaks to the impact of the raid on the boy. Wouldn't any psychologist or psychiatrist who actually examined the child say this action would further traumatize the boy? But sadly, the INS team of experts never did examine the boy to make an informed evaluation. \\n   How could such tactics possibly be in the best interests of a child who has suffered so much? What right did this administration have to add this trauma to the terrible loss Elian has already suffered? And why did he have to suffer at the hands of the people who are supposed to defend the rule of law, the INS, the DoJ, and the President of the United States. \\n   Let's think for a moment about the decision the father and the Justice Department made in putting Elian's life at risk with the plans for the pre-dawn raid. I have never questioned the father's love for the boy, but I cannot imagine any father would choose to put his son's life at risk a second time. But it is not an unloving father who put his son in harm's way-the father is as much a victim as Elian in many ways. The father had a simple choice: travel to a safe house in Miami and have Elian voluntarily transferred into his custody or insist on remaining in Washington and have the U.S. government seize his son in a violent, dangerous raid. Just as it wasn't the father's decision not to come to his boy's side for the first four months of this ordeal, it was not his decision to remain in Washington, forcing a raid at gunpoint. Castro would not allow the father to travel then and he would not allow him to travel last weekend. \\n   President Clinton promised my colleague Senator GRAHAM that Elian would not be seized in the middle of the night, and now we must ask again, why did he promise one thing and yet do another? \\n   Elian deserves access to all of his legal options, Elian deserves an asylum hearing, and he deserves the protection of U.S. law. Yet that is for another day. The use of force must be dealt with today. Does the end justify the means? Will these means ever be justified? \\n   There have been accusations of playing politics with this issue. \\n   But perhaps we ought to recognize what several of the Attorney General's long-time supporters have said. The four mediators from Miami that were involved in the negotiations with Janet Reno have clearly challenged the administration's characterization of the events of last Saturday. They said they were close to an agreement and felt confident a peaceful solution could have been reached. \\n   We cannot simply sweep these issues away and dispense of them in the name of politics. This is a long, sad story and I'm sure many would wish it would simply fade away. But if we accept and commend the actions of our government for acting hastily in choosing excessive force over peaceful mediation, we have traveled down a very troubling road. We dare not condone such use of force to settle legal disputes. This strikes at the very heart of the balance of power and the integrity of our judicial process. \\n   This child and no child should face the intimidation and trauma of an automatic weapon in his face--especially when perpetrated by the American government--a government that has always stood for freedom and human rights throughout the world. As a father and grandfather, I am heartbroken for the frightened, vulnerable child in that photograph. My hope is that no other administration official utter the words, ``I am proud of what we did'' and instead express regret and sorrow for the trauma and pain suffered by the entire Gonzalez family. \\n   What happened saddens me as an American, a father, and a Senator. Mr. President, last Saturday morning, a little bit of America died in that raid and I hope we never again dim the light of freedom for those who look to us for hope. I yield the floor. \\n   I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-20000426\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000426\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 297, submitted earlier by Senator LOTT and Senator DASCHLE. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-20000426\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and a statement of explanation appear at the appropriate place in the RECORD. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000426\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until the hour of 9:30 a.m. on Thursday, April 27. I further ask consent that on Thursday, immediately following the prayer, the Journal of the proceedings be approved to date, the morning hour be deemed to have expired, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and the Senate then begin a period of morning business until 12 noon with Senators speaking for up to 5 minutes each, with the following exceptions: Senator LOTT, or his designee, from 9:30 a.m. to 10 a.m.; Senator DURBIN, or his designee, from 10 a.m. to 10:30 a.m.; Senator HUTCHISON of Texas for up to 30 minutes; Senator DASCHLE, or his designee, for up to 45 minutes; Senator THOMAS, or his designee, for up to 15 minutes. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-20000426\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that at 12 noon the Senate proceed to the cloture vote relative to the marriage tax penalty bill. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000426\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, tomorrow morning, following the period of morning business, the Senate will conduct a cloture vote relative to the marriage tax penalty bill. If cloture is invoked, the Senate will remain on the bill under the provisions of rule XXII. Senators are reminded that second-degree amendments must be filed at the desk by 11 a.m. Thursday, under rule XXII. However, if cloture is not invoked, the Senate will resume debate on the motion to proceed to S.J. Res. 3, proposing an amendment to the Constitution to protect the rights of victims. It is hoped that the Senate will be able to proceed to that bill at a reasonable hour tomorrow. \\n   As a reminder, the Senate did receive the veto message with regard to the nuclear waste bill during today's session. By previous consent, debate on the veto override will begin on Tuesday, May 2, at 9:30 a.m., with a vote to occur at 3:15 that afternoon. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000426\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, if there is no further business to come before the Senate, I now ask unanimous consent that the Senate stand in adjournment under the previous order. \\n   There being no objection, the Senate, at 5:40 p.m., adjourned until Thursday, April 27, 2000, at 9:30 a.m. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000425\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of Senate Resolution 287, expressing the sense of the Senate regarding U.S. policy toward Libya. It is of grave concern to me that the United States is currently considering a change in its ``Travel Ban'' policy with Libya, prior to the resolution of the Pan-Am 103 Bombing trial. \\n   Libya is a state sponsor of terrorism and a global agent of instability. Two Libyan intelligence operatives, with prior terrorist activity convictions, are now on trial for the explosion of Pan Am flight 103 in 1988 and the loss of 270 lives, 180 of them Americans. Libya is engaged in one the most advanced Bio-Chemical efforts in the third world, including the acquisition of delivery vehicles. It has repeatedly engaged U.S. military forces, including an attempted missile attack on U.S. military installations in Italy in 1986. \\n   Taking into account its past behavior, we all agree that Libya has a long way to go to become a member of the family of law-abiding nations. Libya must take concrete actions to provide its sincerity. It must show complete adherence to the Pan Am 103 Judicial Authorities in Hague. If a conviction is reached, Libya must accept responsibility for any court judgement and make full payment to all judgement creditors. It is my sense that Libya must prove its vigilant and sincere cooperation in anti-terrorism efforts. \\n   U.S. policy towards Libya must remain balanced. The ``Travel Ban'' is an important tool and should not be abandoned without clear justification. A verdict is not yet at hand; I urge you to await the conclusion of the Pan Am 103 trial, and calculate our steps from there. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000413\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I hope that our colleagues across the aisle will not prevent us from reducing the marriage penalties in the tax code. This bill will provide married couples the relief that President Clinton denied them last year with his veto of the Taxpayer Refund and Relief Act of 1999. President Clinton's action last year increased taxes by close to $800 billion and imposed a marriage penalty on middle class American families. \\n   There is no place in the tax code for marriage penalties. Marriage penalties are caused by tax laws that treat joint filers relatively worse than single filers with half the income. It has of late become common practice to use the tax code for purposes of social engineering, discouraging some actions with the stick of tax penalties and encouraging others with the carrot of tax preferences. But there is no legitimate policy reason for punishing taxpayers with higher taxes just because they happen to be married. The marriage penalties in the tax code undermine the family, the institution that is the foundation of our society. \\n   I view this bill as just a start. Our tax code will not truly be family-friendly until every single marriage penalty is rooted out and eliminated, so that married couples with twice the income of single individuals are taxed at the same rates, and are eligible for the same tax preferences--including deductions, exemptions, use of IRAs and other savings vehicles--as those single filers. This bill is an important step toward that ultimate goal. \\n   The Democrat criticisms of our bill are misplaced. They argue that our bill contains complicated phase-ins, in contrast to their simple approach. But anyone who reads the bill and their alternative would see that this is false. The Finance Committee bill contains percentages in it, sure enough. And it phases in the relief, that is true. But the percentages and the phase-ins are instructions to the Treasury and the IRS, to make adjustments to the tax brackets. The only people who have to make any new calculations under the Finance Committee bill are the bureaucrats who make up the tax tables, not the taxpayer. \\n   By contrast, the Democrat alternative, in phasing in its relief, requires  taxpayers to calculate their taxes as joint filers, then calculate their taxes as if they were single--a complicated process that requires the allocation of various deductions and credits. Next, the taxpayer would have to determine the difference between these two calculations and then reduce this by a certain percentage. That is supposed to be simple? The Democrat substitute adds to the headaches of tax filing and the demand for tax preparers and tax preparation software. \\n   The Democrats also complain that the Finance Committee bill does more than address their narrow definition of the marriage penalty. They invoke the so-called ``marriage bonus.'' But the ``marriage bonus'' is a red herring. What they call a ``marriage bonus'' results from adjustment tax brackets for joint filers to reflect the fact that two adults are sharing the household income. Under the Democrat approach, single taxpayers who marry a non-working or low-earning spouse should pay the same amount of taxes as when they were single, even though this income must be spread over the needs of two adults. \\n   This approach is fundamentally flawed. The Democrat approach would enshrine in the law a new, ``homemaker penalty.'' The Democrats would make families with one earner and one stay-at-home spouse pay higher taxes than families with the same household income and two earners. \\n   But why discriminate against one-earner families? Why would we want a tax code that penalized families just because one of the spouses chooses the hard work of the household over the role of breadwinner? The Democrat alternative discourages parents from staying home with their infant children, and penalizes people who sacrifice income in order that they can care for their elderly parents. That is just plain wrong. \\n   The Finance Committee bill reduces the marriage penalty in a rational sensible way, by making the standard deduction for joint filers twice what it is for single filers, and by making the ranges at which income is taxed at the 15% and 28% rates twice for joint filers what they are for single filers. This recognizes that marriage is a partnership in which two adults share the household income. Our approach cuts taxes for all American families. The Democrats call this a ``bonus.'' We calm it common sense. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000413\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I come to the floor of the Senate today to tell a story--a modern day tragedy about a mother, Elizabeth, who so loved her son, Elian, that she tried to bring him to the shores of the United States of America from Cuba--to the shores of freedom. Had she succeeded, she would have joined her family members already in the United States: her cousin  who arrived only last year; her son's great uncle and his family who have been in the United States for many years; and another cousin who has been here for over fifteen years. She would have been reunited with many other relatives who must today remain anonymous for fear of retribution by Castro against those still trapped in Cuba. Instead, she met with tragedy in the Florida straits. Elizabeth died. Her five-year-old son survived. \\n   Let me be a little more specific. On November 21, 1999, a group of 14 Cuban citizens boarded a boat bound for the United States and the shores of freedom. The motor failed shortly after departing and the group was forced to return to Cuba. Think of the anxiety at this moment, having to return after risking everything. The anticipation. The disappointment. The fear. \\n   When the boat returned to Cuba, one of the other female passengers, Arianne Horta, placed her young daughter back on the shore of Cuba. She then wanted to make sure that Elizabeth was positive in her decision to take Elian. And despite the fact that Elian had a father in Cuba, Elizabeth brought her son back on the boat to set sail for the second time that night--seeking freedom on the shores of America. \\n   If you are interested in what Elian's mother really wanted, think about the act of choosing to keep her son on the boat, while Arianne took her child off the boat. This is as clear a message as a mother can send that she wanted freedom for her child. She wanted freedom despite the risks involved, despite a failed attempt to flee hours earlier, and despite the fact that the father remained in Cuba. \\n   Think about that moment of choice for Elizabeth--put my son on the beach and he can live with his father, or keep him with me so we could have the hope of freedom. It is clear to me that she valued freedom above everything. Now think--if that was you, and you died, would you want the child returned to Cuba? \\n   Think of yourself in Nazi Germany. A mother successfully smuggles a child out, but dies in the process at the hands of the Nazis. The father, probably under duress, demands the return of his child. Would we contemplate returning him? Would we return a child under the same circumstances to Saddam Hussein's Iraq? If a mother and child were scaling the Berlin wall and the mother was shot, but the child was pushed over--would we send the child back? Absolutely not. \\n   On the night of November 21, this group of Cuban nationals repaired their boat and set sail a second time. On the following night, the boat capsized. The survivors clung to anything that would float and hung on for dear life. After a day struggling for her life, Elizabeth died. But before she passed on, she told a fellow passenger who did survive, Nivaldo Fernandez, to make sure that Elian touches land, to make sure he touches dry land. \\n   As many of my colleagues know well, if a Cuban refugee reaches American soil they will not be sent back to Cuba. Every Cuban knows that reaching ``dry land'' means they will be free from Castro's iron fist. Elizabeth's dying wish was for her Elian to reach dry land. There can be no doubt about what she wanted for her son. \\n   Mr. President, I come to the floor today with great disappointment--disappointment in this Administration and disappointment in the Attorney General. Elian Gonzalez's mother's death will be in vain and this little boy's struggle for freedom, his struggle to live in America, simply is being dismissed if the boy's best interests and the family's legal rights are not considered. \\n   Many will say that this is a simple decision, the INS and the Department of Justice should merely reunite a father with the son he loves. I think all of us recognize the intense and profound bond between parent and child. It is to be respected and cherished. It is a natural instinct to want to reunite parent and child. But these are by no means ordinary circumstances. I ask the American people to look beyond the headlines, to understand the intense pressure this father is under. It is unlike anything you or I will ever experience in a free America. I have no doubt the father loves his little boy. But how many of us have stopped and thought about why this father did not come to his son the day he was found, exhausted and dehydrated having survived a treacherous trip at sea. Consider why he has not come for almost 5 months to support his son, hug his son, comfort his son. Again, I would suspect it is not out of lack of concern for his boy. I would suspect it is because Castro would not let him. \\n   Is it possible the father wants the boy to remain with his family in Miami and live in freedom? My understanding is that the father knew Elian and his mother were coming to this country and even told other family members that he would get to America if he ``had to do so in a bowl.'' \\n   I can't imagine anyone disagrees with the notion that Castro controls the father's words and actions through duress--through intimidation. The fact is that none of us knows the true wishes of this father. Castro has used this father and son to manipulate both Cuba and the United States. \\n   Today, the United States is not about to reunite a boy and his father, instead we are about to reunite a child and his dictator. And we are doing so against his mother's wishes. We may be doing so against his father's wishes, as well. \\n   Last week, a spokesman of the Cuban embassy stated ``Elian Gonzalez is a possession of the Cuban Government.'' In Castro's Cuba, the state always has the last word in how a child is raised--it does not matter if a parent disagrees. According to Cuban law, any parent who questions the regime or takes any action deemed to run contrary to the revolution's goals could be imprisoned or executed. \\n   Let me quote a former Cuban Government official from a recent Washington Post op-ed.  \\n   Within Cuba, the return of Elian will not be seen as an act of justice by the U.S. government, but rather as yet another victory for the bully-boy tactics of Fidel Castro. This is why the dictator is trying to recover Elian--to convert him into a different kind of symbol--a symbol of the Revolution--even though for that to happen, Elian would have to renounce his mother, the family in Miami that took care of him and even in fact, his father, Juan Miguel. Because upon returning to Cuba, he will not belong to his family. He will be another son of the Revolution.  \\n   If Cuba were a free country, this situation would have been easily resolved. But Cuba is not free, it is a police state. In fact, Article 8 of Cuba's Code for Children and Youth states: ``Society and the State work for the efficient protection of youths against all influences contrary to their communist formation.'' \\n   Make no mistake, in Cuba, Elian will not have a normal childhood. \\n   In Cuba, Elian will be allowed to live with his father until he is eleven; thereafter he will be sent to work in a farm-labor camp for 45 to 60 days per year. \\n   In Cuba, Elian will face compulsory military service until he is 27. \\n   In Cuba, Elian will be indoctrinated in the glories of ``the revolution'' and taught to regard any Cubans who reject Castroism--including his dead mother--as counterrevolutionaries and traitors. \\n   In Cuba, Elian will be allowed to attend college only if his ``political attitude and social conduct'' satisfy the regime in Havana. \\n   Returning Elian to Cuba means returning him to Fidel Castro. When I was a child, my parents had the last word in my upbringing. In Cuba, Castro's wishes carry the day--he can override any parent. Be assured Castro will begin his manipulation of Elian from the day of his return. I can see the images now--parades and banners, welcoming home the young defender of the ``Communist Revolution.'' Elian may remain closer to Fidel than any other child may be forced to suffer. The boy may get better treatment as a result, but this will be only on the surface. This innocent child will be captive--a prisoner in his own homeland. The regime cannot afford for this boy to return to Cuba only to renounce Castro's ways. Elian will be treated, not as a child, but as an opportunity to exploit. His home, his education, his father's salary, everything, will be provided as Fidel dictates. The pathetic efforts of a desperate tyrant to legitimize his method of oppression will make Elian a test. My colleagues, he is a child. Instead of Fidel's cruelties, he needs compassion. \\n   There is a reason Elian's mother and countless others have risked everything and have given their lives in the hope that their children will taste freedom. And while Elian's mother's voice  cannot be heard now, her actions were loud and clear. \\n   I would not be so angry if we were truly reuniting a parent and child. But if we return Elian, the United States will be caving to the demands of the last tyrant in the Western Hemisphere and will be sending a six-year-old boy to a place that Human Rights Watch states has a ``highly developed machinery of repression.'' And the United States will be doing this without providing basic civil rights to Elian--without permitting his legal options to play out. \\n   Instead, our Government is short circuiting justice for political expediency and we will have to live with that. The outrage and fury I feel toward the administration, the Department of Justice and the INS for the manner in which they have handled the Elian Gonzalez case is overwhelming. \\n   The United States is a Nation committed to the principles of freedom, justice, democracy and respect for human dignity. We are a nation built upon a rich diversity of heritage. We celebrate the uniqueness of our roots, family traditions and cultural experiences. And while this rich diversity is the strength of our great country, we, as Americans, share a common bond that is even stronger. That common bond is our precious freedom. Freedom to pursue our dreams, freedom to raise our children, freedom to speak our minds, and freedom from a government that dictates what we say, where we should live, and what we will become. \\n   These principles strengthen our democracy, our nation. These principles are what continue to draw people to America's shores. Our democracy is designed to preserve and protect the rights of the weak and the strong. Our judicial system is designed to promote access to justice for all Americans. But what we have seen in the past several weeks from our own Justice Department in its' handling of the Elian Gonzalez case shakes the very foundation of our American principles. \\n   Instead of defending these principles, this Administration has intimidated Elian's American family with the sheer weight, power, and force of the United States Government. This Administration has chosen to grind down this family's emotions and trample on the family's rights. In the process, the best interests of this boy have been undeniably neglected and his mother's wishes ignored. This Administration's treatment of a young child has evolved into an exercise of cruel and unusual punishment to preserve a pre-determined outcome and to placate an old and bitter dictator. \\n   The United States is a free country. We have a Bill or Rights, a code of laws, and a separation of powers which guarantees no administration shall be able to sidestep the law. We are a country in which the judicial system should be permitted to work without presidential influence for political expediency--and certainly without bringing the mighty weight and power of the government down on the weakest of all people--a child. \\n   But, in the last four months, this administration, our United States Government, has overstepped its bounds. Mr. President, I am disillusioned by the present status of this struggle for freedom. Disillusioned that these calls to honor freedom have fallen on deaf ears. But, then I think of the Cuban parents who so loved their children that they sent them unaccompanied to the United States in the 1960's in what became known as ``Operation Pedro Pan.'' Fourteen thousand and eighty-four children were sent away from the clutches of Castro by their loving parents to go to America to live in freedom. These parents willingly sent their children in order to escape Castro--in order to escape oppression. Many, if not most, of these children had no family in the United States. But they were sent to the United States with their parents wish for freedom--freedom at all costs. \\n   We know Elian's mother sought freedom for her son--and she paid the ultimate price. We know many in Elian's family had already come to the United States; some recently, some long ago. But we have taken the sad, sad action of assuming a man whose very life and that of his family, depends upon the goodwill of a tyrant, has the ability to speak freely. What a tragedy that this man cannot speak openly and freely about his true desire. What a sad day in the history of the United States of America. \\n   Our founding principle--our Declaration of Independence--declares, ``we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.'' We, the inheritors of this legacy, must not force people into tyranny. \\n   I appeal to the President and the Attorney General to resolve this in such a manner that Elian's struggle and his mother's tragic death will not have been in vain. Perhaps we, the United States of America, will realize that if we don't, we are making a tragic mistake in the handling of this case. It is not too late, though, to do the right thing for this little boy. I call on the President of the United States and the Attorney General once again, to consider what is in the little boy's best interest. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-20000413\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, there was an interest here, certainly. There are some who have discriminated against one group or another, who have not spoken out for one group and have spoken out for another. \\n   In my career representing the State of Florida and the Senate, I have spoken out for every group looking for honest and fair treatment, whether they be Cuban, whether they be Nicaraguan, or whether they be Haitian. I have done that. I am proud that I have done that. Some of those positions have not been particularly popular in my State. But I have always taken that position. \\n   Again, I think the right thing to do is to ask a very simple question: What is in the boy's best interest? \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000329\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I intend to speak on another issue. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business for not to exceed 5 minutes. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000329\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I come to the floor of the Senate to speak about an incident that occurred just before Thanksgiving Day 1999, when a mother who so loved her son that she tried to bring him to the shores of the United States of America from Cuba. Had she succeeded, she would have joined her family members already in the United States. Instead, she met with tragedy in the Florida straits. The mother died. The five-year-old boy survived. Now, we are being forced to consider young Elian's future. \\n   Today, the freedom sought by a mother for her son is being mocked. Elian Gonzalez finds himself in the middle of a struggle between his Miami family and the Department of Justice, an agency unwilling to consider what is in the best interest of the child, an agency continually impairing a fair presentation of the merits of this case. \\n   I ask my colleagues to open their minds and their hearts and listen to why the current process being used by the DOJ and the INS represents a grave injustice and denies a decision that should be based upon Elian's best interest. Remember when Elian first arrived, the INS stated that the matter was a custody decision for a Florida state family court. Forty-eight hours after Castro threatened the United States, the decision flipped, and continues to bend to Castro's will. Now the administration wants to rush an appeals process to send him back to a country that Human Rights Watch states has ``highly developed machinery of repression.'' \\n   In the past week, the Department of Justice has put unrealistic demands on the family of Elian to expedite the appeal of the federal district court decision. The Department of Justice has repeatedly threatened to revoke Elian's parole and remove the child to Cuba if the family fails to agree to their demand that both sides have an appellate brief prepared in one week. These unprecedented tactics short-circuit and dismantle the judicial process in which an appellate is typically allotted a minimum of 30-60 days to prepare a brief. This is plain and simple--Elian's family's civil rights are being denied. \\n   This past Monday, the family under great pressure filed a motion with the Eleventh Circuit to expedite the appeals process, and still, the government's threats have continued. In a letter sent to the family at 10 p.m. on Monday night, the government demanded that the family's attorneys appear for a meeting on Tuesday morning at 9 a.m. with INS officials to discuss the revocation of Elian's parole. The government has continually dictated the terms of all meetings and has bulldozed over the right of Elian and his Miami family. \\n   Today, the Department of Justice has summoned Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, to a meeting where he is expected by the INS to sign a unilateral demand ``to comply with the instructions of the INS,'' yet the INS has failed to provide the attorneys and the family with what those instructions will be. After all this child has been through, is it too much to ask how the government plans on removing him from the only home he now knows? Should his family agree to having INS agents come to his Miami home and take him? Probably not. But one thing is for sure: they should know the details of what they are agreeing to. \\n   Keep in mind that this same agreement, if signed, destroys any shred of dignity left in our judicial process. It demands that the family's attorneys have a brief prepared to submit to the Supreme Court within 5 days of the appellate court decision, a time line virtually impossible to meet. \\n   In its effort to dictate terms for the family's appeal, the government has betrayed the very integrity for which the Attorney General is charged with defending--equal protection under the law and the right to pursue justice in a free America. In the past week, I've heard justice department officials say they are taking more aggressive action against the family because they want  to prevent them from invoking more ``legal maneuvers.'' These ``legal maneuvers'' happen to be the legal rights of Americans--properly exercised in the middle of an appeals process. These ``legal maneuvers'' are tools in which all Americans are empowered to seek a fair hearing in the United States of America. I find it unconscionable that the justice department would so blatantly express their desire to dictate terms and influence the outcome of this case. \\n   My reason for coming to the floor today is express my sheer frustration and anger in the manner in which the DOJ and the INS has handled this case. The recent acts of these two agencies demonstrate that the administration is no longer interested in resolving this case in a fair, unbiased way. The offer by the Department of Justice is a deeply flawed offer, one that no American would ever accept, one that no person in America should ever have to accept. Elian's mother sacrificed her life for the freedoms of America, freedoms she never had in Cuba, freedoms she never thought our country would deny her son in his moment of need. We should all, despite our views on this issue, be deeply ashamed at any attempt to short circuit justice in order to reach a resolution in the quickest possible way. \\n   In the United States, we stand up to injustice in the world by zealously guarding our laws. We consistently and rightly argue that our strength and power come from our commitment to America's principles: freedom, justice, democracy and the protection of basic human rights. We are a nation founded upon these principles and we remain strong because we defend them. Mr. President, today and throughout the course of Elian's stay in the United States the INS and our Attorney General have not stood up for the one thing they are supposed to defend--justice for all. \\n   Mr. President, I yield the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000322\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I want to express my strong support for repealing the Social Security Earnings Test for working seniors. Many of my colleagues and I have been working together for the past 12 years to pass this legislation. At long last, the Senate is going to retire the Social Security Earnings Test. \\n   The Social Security Earnings Test is a 70 year old dinosaur of a law which was initiated to insure that Social Security benefits were granted specifically to retired persons. Today, unfortunately, economic reality dictates the need for many senior citizens to continue working in order to achieve a basic standard of living. The Social Security Earnings Test stands as a roadblock to independence for tens of thousands of seniors throughout the United States. Furthermore, America's seniors represent a wealth of talent and skill. A national policy which discourages them from working is simply counterproductive. \\n   Clearly, few other states have been as impacted by the unfair Social Security Earnings Test as the people in my home state of Florida. I've seen first-hand the impact upon Seniors of laws which limit income. We have already seen the impact caused by President Clinton's 1993 tax hike on Seniors, when he raised the Social Security benefit tax from 50% up to 85%. When are we, as a nation, going to stop penalizing success? \\n   It's not a group of greedy millionaires who are being impacted by the earnings test restrictions. It's lower and moderate income Seniors who need some relief from their government to simply survive. In Florida, we are talking about grandparents who live on Social Security plus any outside work they can get. And if you have grandma in the hospital or a nursing home fighting Alzheimer's Disease, and grandpa has go find some work to pay the bills, the Social Security Earnings Test is simply another hurdle they have to overcome. \\n   Several years ago, I was visiting a worksite in Safety Harbor, Florida where I met with a group of working Seniors. I asked them why they were working past the traditional retirement age. Some said they simply wanted to have a reason to get out of the house and do something productive. Others said they needed the additional income to take care of a loved one. Still others said they wanted to maintain a certain lifestyle without Federal interference. \\n   But I was most struck by one gentleman who said to me, ``Senator, we live in a throw away society. Don't let them throw us away.'' What this gentleman was saying was that the message the Earnings Test sends is that society no longer needs you. How can we, as a society, say such a thing? Clearly, we shouldn't. \\n   Finally, consider this thought. Baseball fans might remember my grandfather, Connie Mack, who spent many years in major league baseball. In 1929, he managed the World Champion Philadelphia Athletics. In 1929, he was 66 years old. Suppose he had succumbed to the idea that, at that age, there was no purpose for pursuing one's ideas, one's dreams in life. Suppose he had been told by our nation that he was no longer of value to society. He might not have had the opportunity to produce that great team. Fortunately, we didn't have a law which could have forced him into retirement. \\n   The Federal government is sending a message to working Seniors that they are over the hill. The only thing that is over the hill is the Earnings Test. We need to retire the Earnings Test, not our Seniors. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000322\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks regarding the Risk Management for the 21st Century Act. \\n   Floridians know all too well the impact of natural disasters on the agriculture community. While I am proud of the ability of our growers to rebuild their farms after such devastating losses, enormous disaster aid bills only serve as a band-aid fix to the problem. We must work harder to ensure that all farmers have access to the necessary risk-management tools. This bill encourages growers to purchase appropriate levels of crop insurance, hopefully avoiding the band-aid fix in future appropriation measures. \\n   Florida is the ninth leading agricultural state in the nation, with annual farm receipts totaling $6 billion. The industry employs over 80,000 people and generates more than $18 billion in related economic activity. In 1998, hard working Floridians produced more than 25 billion pounds of food, and more than 2 million tons of livestock feed. I am proud to say that Florida leads the nation in production of 18 major agricultural commodities including oranges, sugarcane and fresh tomatoes. With these statistics in mind, it is imperative to ensure that federal programs work with, not against, Florida's farmers. \\n   As an original co-sponsor of S. 1401, the Specialty Crop Insurance Act of 1999, I support the effort to reduce the dependence of the specialty crop industry on catastrophic loss insurance coverage by improving its access to quality crop insurance policies. By failing to account for the unique characteristics associated with farming specialty crops, current crop insurance policies do not include many specialty crop producers. \\n   Through promotion of affordable crop insurance policies, S. 1401 would increase specialty crop producer participation in the Federal Crop Insurance Program. Today's legislation, S. 2251, the Risk Management for the 21st Century Act, includes many of these specialty crop provisions. \\n   This legislation requires that 50% of the funds dedicated to research and development for the new crop insurance products are focused on specialty crop product development. At a level of $20 million per year, the legislation authorizes the Risk Management Agency to enter into partnerships with private and public entities to increase the availability of risk management tools for specialty crops. The expertise of outside agencies will most certainly help the Risk Management Agency develop sound specialty crop insurance policies. \\n   The Risk Management for the 21st Century Act also includes an expansion of Risk Management Agency pilot authority, removal of the Non-insured Assistance Program (NAP) area trigger, incentives for growers who purchase ``buy-up'' coverage, and it proposes a premium refund for low-risk producers. These reforms will ease our nation's growers dependence on short sighted disaster relief bills. \\n   This bill is the product of countless hours of negotiation, and I believe it represents an incredible opportunity to improve our Federal Crop Insurance Program. The Agriculture Committee has been extremely helpful in including the interests of specialty crop producers, and I thank them for their time and effort. I urge my colleagues to support the Risk Management for the 21st Century Act. \\n   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000309\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, S. Res. 60, makes March 10, 2000 the Tibetan Day of Commemoration. This marks the forty-first anniversary of the 1959 Lhasa uprising over the course of which over 87,000 Tibetans were killed, arrested, or deported to labor camps by the People's Liberation Army. So tomorrow, we honor the memory of the  more than 87,000 Tibetans who struggled for the preservation of Tibet. We also honor the 6 million Tibetans today who keep alive the hope of freedom in Tibet and the tens of thousands of exiles who hope to return home. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000302\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise in support of amendment 2827. This amendment, cosponsored by Senators HATCH and MURKOWSKI, is very simple and straightforward. It eliminates the marriage penalty in the education savings accounts. \\n   Married couples should not suffer a tax increase just because they are married. The so-called marriage penalties in the Tax Code do just that. Married couples often have to pay higher taxes than the couple would owe if they were single filers. The House has recently addressed this issue in the broader Tax Code, and we will soon do the same. But it makes no sense to have marriage penalties built into newer programs we have created, such as the tax-free education savings accounts. \\n   Under this amendment, as under the administration's HOPE scholarship tax credit and Lifetime Learning credit, the income eligibility for joint filers would be double the amount for single filers. People who qualify for these accounts when they are single should not lose this valuable opportunity to provide for their children's education just because they got married. \\n   When the Senate first passed education savings accounts in the 1997 Taxpayer Relief Act, all Americans  were eligible to use these vehicles to save for their children's education. While that bill was in conference, however, income limits were added to this tax benefit, but these limits injected a marriage penalty into this provision. There is absolutely no policy justification for a marriage penalty in education tax benefits. This should not be a partisan issue. \\n   As I mentioned earlier, the administration's education proposal did not contain a marriage penalty, but the income limits the administration negotiated when the 1997 bill was in conference created a marriage penalty in the education savings accounts. Now is the time for us to eliminate this marriage penalty. \\n   According to my Joint Economic Committee staff, this amendment will allow over 2 million households to establish education savings accounts for their children. \\n   We should be looking to remove marriage penalties in the Tax Code instead of making them worse. Our amendment will ensure that married couples can save for their children's education on an equal basis, as single individuals can. \\n   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and yield the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-20000302\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I wanted to put some information in the RECORD. It is unfortunate that all Members did not have the information as to what the cost of this amendment would be. It is nowhere near what was implied by my friend who just concluded his comments. \\n   The Joint Tax Committee has estimated the amendment will reduce taxes by only $7 million over 10 years. That is point one. Point two, the reason that is the case is because the individuals who would be affected by this already have the option to use prepaid tuition plans. \\n   Now, there seems to be agreement with respect to tuition tax plans of people of high income, as Senator REID indicated a moment ago. We have all agreed it was fair to them. Why is it not fair to allow the same benefits to derive to them under the education savings accounts as under the prepaid tuition plan? \\n   So, again, the cost is $7 million over 10 years. Roughly 2 million families would be affected, not 20 percent of potential families. It is narrowly focused and it is addressing the issue of a marriage penalty; there is no place in our proposal, the education savings plan, for discriminating against those who are married. \\n   I thank the Chair for the time. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000302\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and my friend and colleague Senator GRAHAM to introduce a resolution contragulating Florida State University's football team on winning the 1999 Division 1-A Collegiate Football National Championship. As a Senator from Florida and the father-in-law of an avid Seminole, I join with all those in my home state and those across this country in honoring Coach Bobby Bowden, his staff, and the football team for this outstanding accomplishment. Not only is this a special achievement that will long be remembered by the coaches and the players but it is also a moment to savor for the students, alumni and supporters of Florida State University. \\n   Florida State University has one of the most exciting, prolific and successful college football teams in the country. In fact, they won 108 football games between 1990 and 1999, more than any other Division 1-A college football team during this timeframe. By finishing the 1999 season undefeated and untied, they have also extended their NCAA Division 1-A record streak of top-four finishes in the final Associated Press poll to 13 years in a row, the only football team to have accomplished this feat. \\n   But as impressive as all these achievements are, they have accomplished what no other football team has been able to do. The 1999 Seminoles are the first Division I-A collegiate football team in the country to be ranked number one for the entire season by the Associated Press since the preseason rankings began in 1950. \\n   1999 will also be remembered fondly by my good friend Bobby Bowden for reasons other than surpassing the 300 victory mark, or winning his second football national championship, or for obtaining his first perfect season in 40 years as a head football coach. In 1999, Coach Bowden and his lovely wife, Ann, celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary. Coach Bowden, Priscilla and I wish you and your wife our sincere congratulations on this most important milestone. \\n   The State of Florida is indeed fortunate to be the home to three of the finest college football teams in the nation: Florida State University, the University of Florida and the University of Miami. Together, these three schools have won seven Division 1-A college football championships since 1984. That's seven college football championships in the last 16 years. This proves that the road to the college football national championship goes right through the State of Florida. \\n   For those who love to wear the Garnet and Gold and do the Seminole Chop and the FSU War Chant, I am honored to introduce this resolution on their behalf, which honors the 1999 Florida State football team, the coaches and staff for winning the Division 1-A Collegiate Football national championship. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000224\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I object. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000224\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to commemorate four brave Americans. Theirs is a story of courage, it is a story of heroism, and it is a story of freedom. \\n   Four years ago today, on February 24, 1996, Fidel Castro sent Cuban MiG fighters into the Florida Straits and killed Carlos Costa, Armando Alejandre, Mario de la Pen 6a, and Pablo Morales. \\n   These men were members of a humanitarian organization known as ``Brothers to the Rescue.'' These volunteers search the Florida Straits for rafters. Too many Cubans die each year in their flight to freedom. The Brothers try to save lives. \\n   So my thoughts and prayers today are with the families of the brave and courageous humanitarians who lost their lives 4 years ago. I know this day must be especially difficult for the families--today reminds them of the terrible loss suffered, and today also  marks another year passed without closure. \\n   People need to be able to put the past behind them and move on. But when the President and his administration give assurances and advice, and American families trust and obey this advice only to be dragged along and let down, the administration commits a great injustice. \\n   Think for a moment about Armando's sister or Mario's mother, or any other family member. Think for a moment, how you would feel if your brother or son was murdered while volunteering with a humanitarian organzation--killed by state-of-the-art fighter jets flown by the air force of one of the world's last totalitarian dictators? I know the pain for me would be unbearable. \\n   I join with the families today in remembering these brave men. I want to tell their story of freedom, their story of courage, and their story of heroism. \\n   Armando came to the United States from Cuba as a child. He so loved his life here, his freedom, that he joined the U.S. Marine Corps and volunteered for a tour in Vietnam. He volunteered to fight for his adopted home. He survived his tour only to be murdered by Fidel Castro. He was 45 years old. His wife of 21 years and his daughter have now lived with the struggle for justice for 4 years. They are in our thoughts today. \\n   Carlos, a Florida native, was 29 years old when the Cuban government shot him out of the sky. He was always interested in aviation and dreamed of one day overseeing the operations of a major airport. He received his college degree from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University and worked for the Dade County Aviation Department. His parents and sister today are in our thoughts. \\n   Mario, a New Jersey native, was only 24 years old when Castro's MiG's took his life. He was in his last semester at Embry-Riddle, working toward his dream of becoming an airline pilot. His parents and brother are in our thoughts today. \\n   Pablo left Cuba on a raft in 1992, and the Brothers to the Rescue saved his life. Indebted to these heroic pilots, he joined them and began training to obtain his pilot's license. Pablo often talked of his family still in Cuba and how much he missed them. Since his death, there are reports that they have been persecuted and discriminated against. Our thoughts are with his family in Cuba today. \\n   Remember, as you think of these men this afternoon, what they were doing when they lost their lives--they were working to save the lives of others. This humanitarian effort must have so enraged Fidel Castro that he ordered the interception of these small, unarmed aircraft by his huge fighter jets to be blown from the sky with air-to-air missiles. \\n   Two days after their murder four days ago, the President so moved by this tragedy said on national television;  \\n   I am asking that Congress pass legislation that will provide immediate compensation to the families, something to which they are entitled under international law, out of Cuba's blocked assets here in the United States.  \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-20000224\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Two months later the Congress passed the bill--the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1996--and the President signed it in a large ceremony on the White House lawn. \\n   The Brothers' families wanted to understand the new rules before they chose to proceed with any civil suit. They met with officials from the U.S. State Department to clarify the meaning of the new law. \\n   In their meeting at the State Department, the families were told the U.S. Government encouraged them to file the civil lawsuit against the Cuban government. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-3-20000224\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, they took the Cuban Government to court. It took a long time, but eventually they won. In December of 1997, almost 2 years ago, a United States Federal court entered judgments against Cuba for the murders of their family members. Justice seemed to be won. The end appeared to be near. But the very same U.S. Government and the same Clinton administration that encouraged the families to postpone closure and pursue legal justice began to oppose them. They entered the lawsuit on the side of Fidel Castro. \\n   I quote from Maggie Khule's testimony of last October before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Maggie Khule is the sister of Armando Alejandre:  \\n   No words can possibly explain our shock when we went to court and found U.S. attorneys sitting down at the same table as Cuba's attorneys. How can you explain to a mother who has lost her son, to a wife who has lost her husband, to a daughter who has lost her father, that their own government is taking the murderer's side?...... The Clinton administration has shut its doors to us. Secretary of State Albright, for example, won't meet with us on any of our other concerns because, to quote an aide, ``We are on the opposing side of this civil action.'' Are we? We thought we were the victims' families, victims ourselves. We thought we were Americans entitled to protection from our own country. We thought Cuba was the terrorist, the guilty party.  \\n   Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to take a moment from their busy schedules today, on this fourth anniversary of the murder of four brave humanitarians, and think about the blight of terrorism and the cost it has extracted from too many families of our country. \\n   Think also this afternoon about what we ask to deter terrorism and promote justice. I want to read one more quote, this time from a Federal judge who heard the case brought by the families against Cuba. After observing this administration's change of position from support to opposition, he states the following in the March 1999 ruling:  \\n   The court notes with great concern that the very President who in 1996 decried this terrorist action by the Government of Cuba now sends the Department of Justice to argue before this court that Cuba's blocked assets ought not to be used to compensate the families of the U.S. nationals murdered by Cuba. The executive branch's approach to this situation has been inconsistent at best. It apparently believes that shielding a terrorist state's assets are more important than compensating for the loss of American lives.  \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-4-20000224\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, the story of these four brothers, the Brothers to the Rescue, is a story of heroism and freedom. These men risked their lives for their own freedom as well as for the freedom of others, and their families have fought tirelessly for justice. I hope my colleagues will think about these courageous families. We must, indeed, honor them and their memories and the memories of their loved ones this afternoon. \\n   Mr. President, I yield the floor. \\n   Transcript From ABC News, February 26, 1996 \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000207\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I understand that S. 2036, introduced earlier today by Senator SMITH of New Hampshire, is at the desk and I, therefore, ask for its first reading. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-20000207\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I now ask for its second reading and object to my own request. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000207\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today it adjourn until the hour of 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday, February 8. I further ask consent that on Tuesday, immediately following the prayer, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the morning hour be deemed expired, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and the Senate then begin a period of morning business until 10:30 a.m., with Senators speaking for up to 5 minutes each, with the following exceptions: The first 30 minutes under the control of Senator DURBIN or his designee; the second 30 minutes under the control of Senator THOMAS or his designee. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-20000207\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Further, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate stand in recess from the hours of 12:30 p.m. to 2:15 p.m. for the weekly policy conferences to meet. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000207\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. For the information of all Senators, the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 10:30 a.m. Following morning business, it is expected that the Senate will then begin consideration of the nuclear waste disposal bill. If that consent is not granted, then there is an understanding that a cloture vote will occur at 2:15 on Tuesday with respect to a committee amendment. Members should be aware that amendments to the nuclear waste bill are anticipated, and those concerned are close to reaching an agreement providing for a limited number of amendments and debate time. Therefore, Senators can expect votes throughout tomorrow's session of the Senate. It is hoped that Senators who have amendments will work with the bill managers in an effort to complete this legislation in a timely manner. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000207\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. If there is no further business to come before the Senate, I now ask unanimous consent that the Senate stand in adjournment under the previous order. \\n   There being no objection, the Senate, at 5:10 p.m., adjourned until Tuesday, February 8, 2000, at 9:30 a.m. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000124\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000124\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I send a bill to the desk and ask for its first reading. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-20000124\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I now ask for its second reading. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-3-20000124\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I then ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-20000124\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill granting Elian Gonzalez American citizenship. \\n   What it means is that the most important decision in this young boy's life will not be made by a political bureaucracy--but by a family court. \\n   Mr. President, neither the President of the United States, his Attorney General, nor the dictator ruling Cuba is qualified to decide the fate of this little boy. The United States is a country of laws, and we zealously believe in the rule of law. Elian deserves access to the legal protections of our family courts. These courts are in the business of considering family cases day after day. And they would consider ``what is in the boy's best interest.'' Today, the only concern of the INS is ``who speaks for the boy,'' not about his future. \\n   The primary purpose of this legislation is to ensure Elian has access to America's family courts: a court that will consider the choice that his mother made when she gave her life for freedom. \\n   Mr. President, we will continue this debate sometime later in the week and make no mistake, I believe that Elian should remain here in the United States where he can live in freedom. But it is not my purpose to make that decision; that is the function of a family court. \\n   This bill is intended to allow a family court to settle this dispute based upon the best interests of Elian Gonzalez. \\n   I yield the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19991118\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-19991118\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19991110\\n\\n    Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to address a problem that ought to be a concern to all of us: natural disasters and the exposure of the private insurance industry to catastrophic risks. In my state of Florida, we have a particular concern about hurricane risk, but many areas of the country are exposed to the risks of other major catastrophes--whether they be volcanoes, earthquakes or tornadoes. Increasingly, I am concerned about the state of the private insurance industry and its ability to withstand a major catastrophe--a catastrophe of Hurricane Andrew size ($15 billion in insured losses) or greater. \\n   Today, I am introducing legislation to help address this problem and strengthen disaster protection for homeowners and businesses while protecting the interests of the taxpayer. I am pleased my friend from Texas, Senator HUTCHISON, has joined me in this effort. I believe our approach is an innovative, private-sector solution to the problem of catastrophic risk and I encourage my colleagues to review this proposal carefully. \\n   Consumers of property and casualty insurance must be able to rely on their insurers for protection against the risk of catastrophic loss. However, protection for policyholders in today's system is weak; a major future catastrophe could leave consumers without protection and--if past experience is any indication--the government would intervene to ensure the people in the disaster areas receive timely compensation. It is important to note that current law actually poses a disincentive for insurers to set aside special reserves for catastrophic events. Any money set aside to cover potential risk is considered taxable income. To fix this flaw in America's insurance system, we need to provide incentives for insurers to set aside a portion of their policy premiums in secure reserve funds that will be available to meet policyholder needs in the event of future catastrophes. Our bill does just that. \\n   The typical property and casualty insurance company in the United States is exposed to multiple forms of catastrophic risk. This risk can take the form of major disasters that occur only once in a decade or once in several decades (e.g., severe earthquakes, major hurricanes). These can also be in the form of localized natural disasters (e.g., tornadoes, wildfires, floods, winter storms) that cause unusually large policyholder losses in a region and imperil the ability of smaller insurance companies to help their policyholders in the area. \\n   The nation's exposure to these large natural disasters is staggering. While millions of families and small businesses rely on insurance payments to recover from natural disasters, it is important to remember that--under our current insurance tax and regulatory systems--many private insurers may not be able to pay all claims arising from a major disaster. Hurricane Andrew and the Northridge Earthquake opened our eyes to the country's massive exposure to catastrophic losses. Insured losses in my state from Hurricane Andrew exceeded $15 billion. But if this storm had passed over Miami, rather than Homestead just 40 miles south, insured losses could have reached $50 billion, leaving the Florida economy crippled and more than a third of all insurers in that market insolvent. \\n   There is always the potential for a major disaster in any given year in the United States. Estimates of insured losses from highly probable events range from about $75 billion in California and Florida to $100 billion or more in areas of the Midwest. The Gulf, Intermountain West, and Atlantic states all face exposures of approximately $20 billion or more. \\n   Unfortunately, our current system of tax laws and accounting rules work against consumers and taxpayers because they discourage private market preparation for future major disasters. Present tax laws do not permit portions of consumers' insurance policy payments to be set aside and tax deferred in order to provide for the risk of truly catastrophic loss events. Ironically, our tax system allows insurers to set aside funds on a tax-deductible basis to address disasters that have already happened but it gives them no incentive to prepare for those major disasters that have not yet happened. \\n   Policyholder premiums needed to fund policyholders' catastrophic losses in future years are subject to current tax if not used in a particular year. This diminishes the power of insurers to protect policyholders against future losses. This structure is inadequate for assuring that property-casualty policies will protect consumers from future major catastrophic losses. \\n   The tax law should be revised in order to make accommodation for disaster protection reserves and bring about a more practical, and sensible, system for insurance companies and consumers. \\n   Under the Policyholder Disaster Protection Act, insurers could set aside portions of policyholder payments in a tax-deferred disaster protection fund. Amounts from this fund used to pay for losses from a major disaster would be subject to taxation. This concept is similar to programs presently in place in many other developed countries. \\n   I believe this legislation would result in greater stability for insurers providing catastrophic coverage and fewer insolvencies after a major disaster. A recent study by a major U.S. accounting firm determined that approximately $21 billion in pre-funded reserves would be accumulated within the first ten years of the program.  Also, the tax incentive in the bill will encourage insurers to serve disaster-prone areas in a responsible manner by setting aside funds to pay for major losses. \\n   The treatment of the fund by insurers would be closely regulated. Following is a general description of the provisions of the bill: \\n   Insurers would be able to set aside special tax-deferred reserves to cover potential catastrophic events. \\n   The maximum amount any insurer could set aside in a given year would be determined by reference to each insurance company's exposure to the risk of catastrophic loss events. \\n   Deductible contributions to disaster protection funds would be voluntary, but would be irrevocable once made (except to the extent of ``drawdowns'' for actual catastrophic loss events, or drawdowns otherwise required by state insurance regulators). No company could use these funds to shelter income from taxation. \\n   The maximum allowable reserve for any given company will increase or decrease as they enter or exit lines of business that pose catastrophic risk. \\n   Insurers would only be allowed to drawdown the disaster reserves if the loss event in question is declared an emergency or disaster by certain recognized bodies or government officials (for example, a disaster declared by the President under the Stafford Act) and that losses in a year exceed the specified high level. The amounts distributed from the fund are added to company's taxable income for the year in which the drawdown occurred. \\n   Insurance companies would pay taxes on income generated when funds in the disaster reserve are invested. This income would be distributed out of the fund to the insurance company and taxed to the company on a current basis. \\n   The maximum reserve (or ``cap'') would be phased in at the rate of five percent per year over 20 years. Industry estimates indicate private reserves of $40 billion would be built up over this time. \\n   Various concepts to address the problem of catastrophic losses have been proposed over the years. I look forward to working with all of my colleagues to craft a comprehensive solution to both the short-term and long-term problems presented by the risk of catastrophic disasters. In my view, the private-sector focus of this bill, which puts a strengthened private insurance market for consumers in the forefront of disaster protection, is an approach designed to ensure disaster relief is efficient and cost-effective for taxpayers. While the federal government may still need to provide last-resort safety net for disaster victims, it is important to do what we can to ensure private insurance is available, affordable and secure for those citizens in those areas of the country at risk to a catastrophic disaster. This bill will help to bring precisely that availability, affordability and security to insurance policyholders throughout the country, and I believe it is worthy of support and consideration. \\n   The bill we're introducing today mirrors a bill introduced by Congressman FOLEY and MATSUI in the House of Representatives. It is also supported by taxpayer, homeowner, consumer, business and emergency service organizations, as well as local and state policy makers and insurance organizations. I believe it is a sensible approach and I hope my colleagues will join me in this effort. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19991104\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with my good friend Senator GRAMM, chairman of the Committee on Banking, on section 507 of the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999. I want to confirm that section 507 is intended to apply only to the amendments made by subtitle A of title V of the bill, and that section 507 is not to be construed, under any circumstances, to apply to any provision of law other than the provisions of subtitle A. For instance, subtitle A of title V relates only to disclosure of nonpublic personal information to nonaffiliated third parties. This means that section 507 of the bill does not supersede, alter, or affect laws on the disclosure of information among affiliated entities. In particular, section 507 does not supersede, alter, or affect the provisions of the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (or FCRA) regarding the communication of information among persons related by common ownership or affiliated by corporate control, nor does section 507 supersede, alter, or affect the existing FCRA preemption of state laws with respect to the exchange of information among affiliated entities. I yield to my friend. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-19991104\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the conference report accompanying S. 900, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999. And I want to begin my remarks today by congratulating Senator GRAMM, my friend and the chairman of the committee. We would not be here without his hard work, dedication, and skillful negotiation and he deserves the lion's share of credit for the fine bill we have before us today. \\n   We are making history here. It has been 66 years since Congress passed the Glass-Steagall banking act in the depths of the Great Depression. It has been at least twenty years since determined efforts began in the Congress to repeal this outdated law and modernize the country's banking code. Today--finally--we have come to the end of the road. \\n   As we stand on the verge of passing this bill, we have a great view both backward and forward. We can see a past in which the country's financial services industry led the world despite an archaic code recognized by everyone to be insufficient. And we can look ahead into a future that offers the American financial consumer: New and innovative products, better choices, information and service, and workable regulations that allow our financial firms to compete in the global marketplace to an even greater extent than today. \\n   This much-needed legislation modernizing our nation's banking laws is happening none too soon. I want to spend some time talking about the two reasons I believe we're here. The first is the transformation of our economy over the past 20 years, and by extension the remarkable changes in our financial services sector. And the second is the tremendous impact of the technological revolution on the banking industry. \\n   We are currently in the eighth year of the longest peacetime economic expansion in our history. When you look at the data, there is only one conclusion to draw: we are now reaping the economic benefits of the hard decisions on economic fundamentals we made back in the 1980s. Under the leadership of President Reagan, we dramatically lowered marginal tax rates, began the rollback of burdensome and overlapping regulations, promoted openness to trade and investment around the world, lowered interest rates, and defeated the inflation menace that crippled our economic competitiveness. In the 1990s, Congress finally completed the job by producing the first balanced federal budgets in a generation. \\n   You cannot overestimate the impact of these fundamental economic victories on the prosperity the nation is enjoying today. One of my biggest concerns, as I think about the history of this era, is people will be left with the impression that President Clinton's 1993 tax increases created this economic expansion. Nothing could be further from the truth. We must not forget the hard--and ultimately correct--decisions made on fundamental questions like taxes, regulation, interest rates, and inflation in the 1980s that freed up the marketplace and allowed American businesses to capitalize on their inherent advantages. \\n   The country's financial sector has certainly shared in this prosperity. We have witnessed a revolution in the delivery of financial services during the 1990s as the traditional barriers between banking, insurance and securities began to come down. Freedom and our free enterprise system ensured that new financial products and alliance emanated from America to service the demands of the global economy. These products and alliance provide American businesses, investors, and consumers with the ability to secure more easily the capital they need to finance their hopes and dreams. As this new economic and financial dynamic became more clear, it was also apparent our existing banking code was outdated and in need of change. \\n   As part of the new economy, it is hard to overstate the impact of the technological revolution on the financial marketplace. Earlier this year, during hearings on the bill before us, Chairman Greenspan noted the financial sector:  \\n   ..... is undergoing major and fundamental change driven by a revolution in technology, by dramatic innovations in the capital markets, and by the globalization of the financial markets and the financial services industry.  \\n   Indeed, the financial marketplace is changing with lightning speed. In September, we held a high-technology summit at the Joint Economic Committee. One of those who testified before our committee was a \\n   twenty-nine-year-old entrepreneur who created an electronic stock trading network. Nine of these electronic trading networks make up about twenty percent of the NASDAQ market and are posing a serious challenge to more traditional stock exchanges and markets. Mortgages and traditional banking services are available over the internet. And anybody who watches television advertisements knows a new generation od web-based businesses are transforming the traditional image--and, incidentally, the fee structure--of stock brokers and stock trading. These businesses and the many others who have gone online to challenge the existing orthodoxy are prompting sweeping changes in the financial marketplace. And they are creating yet another imperative for this bill. \\n   As the American financial industry seized on technological advances to lead the world into new financial markets and new financial products, they awoke from their long slumber of lobbying wars and turf protection and realized it was in everybody's best interest to pass this bill. If our financial firms are to lead and compete in the world marketplace, they must be able to compete from a position of strength. And they must compete from the foundation of banking laws that reflect the new realities of the world marketplace. \\n   The end game on this legislation was by no means easy. During the eleven months we spent writing this bill, we had to continually strike careful balances between the broad, over-arching goals of the bill and the temptation to tinker with the marketplace and predetermine the shape of future financial products and services. The fast pace of change presents a difficult choice for policymakers. We are often too cumbersome in the Congress to lead, we can be irrelevant if we follow, and some among us believe it could be risky to get out of the way. In the face of this dilemma, some of our colleagues wanted us to anticipate every possible side-effect of this financial transformation and write the laws accordingly. This is just not possible, and the resultant regulatory burdens would have stopped this financial revolution in its tracks.  \\n   In the bill before us today, we tried to embrace the following principles: \\n   First, banks, insurance companies and securities firms should be able to enter one another's business and create a financial dynamic for the next century; \\n   Second, new banking products should be regulated by the regulator that knows them best. \\n   Third, institutions should disclose to customers what they are doing with their sensitive personal information--both within and outside the financial firm. And customers should be able to stop these companies from sharing their information with third parties. \\n   Next, new financial activities conducted through subsidiaries of banks should be conducted so as to ensure taxpayer guaranteed deposits are not threatened. \\n   And finally, the burdensome regulations on banks with respect to community lending should not be increased as a result of what we're doing in this bill. \\n   There are sensible guidelines and I'm satisfied we've created the basis here for a safe, sound and flexible financial industry that will serve the interests of American consumers, investors and businesses well into the future. \\n   As I said at the beginning of my remarks, we are making history here. A hundred years from today, I believe the primary thing people will remember about this Congress is that we finally did the right thing and passed this bill. \\n   Mr. President, I would like to conclude my remarks on a personal note. As I begin to recognize the reality that my service in the United States Senate will end in slightly more than a year, I find I am engaging in the occasional reflection. \\n   During the last 12 years of my 18 years in the Congress, I served on the Senate Banking Committee--the committee responsible for writing and overseeing the laws of the land that regulate the banking and financial industry. This has been special to me because I spent the first sixteen years of my career in the banking business. It was work I enjoyed as the years went by. It was also work I found increasingly frustrating because of the stifling regulatory burden placed on banks by the federal government. It was for these and other reasons I left my position as President and LEO of my bank in Cape Coral, Florida and ran for the Congress. \\n   I will not stand here today and claim the credit for the far-reaching and far-sighted bill before us today. My friend and colleague Senator GRAMM deserves the credit on the Senate side. I nonetheless feel a strong sense of pride and institutional accomplishment for the legacy we are leaving to the United States in passing this bill. It will benefit the people, the industry, and the economy as a whole and it is truly a document we can all be very proud of. I urge my colleagues to support the conference report \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19991103\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to thank the chairman of the committee, Mr. ROTH, for including in the manager's package an amendment by Mr. SARBANES and myself expressing the sense of the Congress with respect to the issue of debt relief for poor countries. Our resolution simply expresses the desire of this body to work with the President and the international community to forgive the debt owed to us by the world's poorest countries in exchange for commitments from these countries to reform their economies and work toward a better quality of life for their people. This follows on legislation we introduced earlier this month to accomplish this important objective. \\n   Our effort today is premised on the notion that we must help these poverty-stricken nations break the vicious cycle of debt and give them the economic opportunity to liberate their futures. This issue has united people of diverse interests and backgrounds from all around the world. There is a growing sense across the cultural and political spectrum that debt burdens are a major impediment to economic reform and the alleviation of the abject poverty facing the world's poorest countries. And there is increasing certainty that debt forgiveness--if done right--can be a positive force for change in the developing world. Our resolution makes clear that the objectives of debt relief should be the promotion of policies that promote economic growth, openness to trade and investment, and the development of free markets. I am glad the full Senate is joining us in this endeavor. \\n   Today, Mr. President, the world's poorest countries owe an average of $400 for every man, woman, and child within their borders. This is much more than most people in these countries make in a year--in fact more than one billion people on Earth today live on less than a dollar a day. Debt service payments in many cases consume a majority of a poor country's annual budget, leaving scarce domestic resources for economic restructuring or such vital human services as education, clean water and sanitary living conditions. In Tanzania, for example, debt payments would require nearly four-fifths of the government's budget. In a country where one child in six dies before the age of five, little money remains to finance initiatives that would improve the country's economic prospects, its openness to trade and investment, or the standard of living of its people. Among sub-Saharan African countries--many of the very countries we're looking to help in the trade package before us today--one in five adults can't read or write. \\n   Mr. President, the problems in the developing countries that yield such grim statistics will never be solved without a monumental commitment of will from their leaders, their citizens, and the outside world. We cannot solve all these problems today. Rather, we are simply affirming to the world that the small step of debt relief is one that can and should be taken without delay. \\n   The effort to forgive the debts of the world's poorest countries has been ongoing for more than a decade. During this time the international community and the G7 came to the realization that the world's poorest countries are simply unable to repay the debt they owe to foreign creditors. What's more, the payments that are being made are hampering progress toward more free, open, and economically vibrant economies. The external debt for many developing nations is more than twice their gross domestic product, leaving many unable to even make interest payments. We must accept the fact that this debt is unpayable. The question is not whether we'll ever get paid back, but rather what we can encourage these heavily indebted countries to do for themselves in exchange for our forgiveness. \\n   In Uganda, for example, debt relief obtained under the existing debt forgiveness programs has cleared the way for a doubling of classroom size, allowing twice as many children to attend school as before. This type of benefit is real. It is tangible. And it will bring untold benefits to the country in future years. We must do more to encourage these types of programs and debt relief is one vehicle that can help effect real change in the developing world. \\n   Prudent debt relief is in all of our best interests. It is an investment in the commitment of the world's poorest countries to implement sound economic reforms and help their people live longer, healthier and more prosperous lives. \\n   Our amendment today is another step toward this goal and I thank my colleagues for their support. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19991028\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the very important trade package that the Senate is currently considering. At a time when our global marketplace is expanding faster than ever, we need to ensure that the poorest countries around the world are not left behind. \\n   This comprehensive package uses trade to promote economic self-sufficiency, at the same time allowing for broader access to American goods and services to these markets. While many believe the economic and financial answer for these underdeveloped countries may lie in direct financial assistance, I believe the answer is found by facilitating direct private investment. \\n   I want to share with colleagues the plight of one of these countries which I experienced firsthand this past weekend. I spent 2 days in Haiti meeting with political, business, and humanitarian groups. \\n   By far, the most dramatic portion of my trip was witnessing the extreme poverty and despair that grips that Nation. I saw the face of an economy suffering from 17-percent inflation and unemployment of between 60 and 80 percent. \\n   Let me tell the story of one little boy I met. Only through a humanitarian organization and through the support of private donations is this 9-year-old boy able to obtain an education. As a tool to economic and democratic stabilization, aid is simply not enough. Many children just aren't able to stay in school. They are required to work in order to contribute to their families' survival. \\n   Again, I make the point that for a good number of the people in Haiti, their per capita income is around $50 a year. A straight calculation of the per capita income is about $500. But if you look at the makeup of that distribution, you can see easily that there are literally millions of people in Haiti who live with a per capita income of around $50. \\n   If these children are to have a future, revitalization and expansion of economic opportunities are needed to reach the goal of economic self-sufficiency. By creating a framework for using trade and investment as a development tool, the United States will be fostering reform at the economic base of these countries, taking direct aim at lowering unemployment and high inflation rates. \\n   This legislation creates this framework by extending enhanced trade benefits to the countries of the Caribbean Basin. Since the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, U.S. imports from Caribbean countries have been at a distinct disadvantage. The measure would build on the existing Caribbean Basin Initiative program, often referred to as CBI, by providing additional trade benefits to Caribbean countries similar to that which Mexico and Canada currently enjoy. \\n   Since its inception, CBI has had a significant positive economic impact on both the United States and the Caribbean countries, helping to promote regional security and stability of our Caribbean neighbors. Opening this market even further, particularly following the recent devastation inflicted by hurricanes, will help to stimulate job growth by increasing exports and expanding market access to these countries for U.S. businesses. \\n   Another important component of this trade package establishes U.S. support for economic self-reliance in sub-Saharan Africa. The United States stands to benefit a great deal from a strong and prosperous Africa. By fostering growth-oriented economic policies, we will help support broader access to African markets for American goods and services. Sub-Saharan Africa makes up a market of more than 700 million people and is potentially one of the largest markets in the world. As economic reforms and market-opening measures spur growth in Africa, it will create new and bigger markets for U.S. exporters. \\n   A particularly sensitive, albeit important, provision included in both the African Growth and Opportunity Act and the Caribbean Basin Trade Enhancement Act deals with textiles. The textile and apparel industries have historically provided the first step toward industrialization in many countries. This is because production is fairly simple, can be done on a small scale, and often uses locally abundant raw material. \\n   In seeking to address the concerns raised by the U.S. textile industry, this legislation has sought compromise by restricting preferential treatment to apparel produced by U.S. fabric and yarns. \\n   Additionally, this legislation provides strong protections against illegal transshipment of goods through Africa  or eligible CBI countries. We need to ensure that these countries do not become stop-over points for products from countries not eligible for preferential treatment under the legislation. \\n   International trade has been an important part of the growth we have enjoyed in the United States. Since 1994, international trade has created more than 11 million American jobs, and accounts for 30 percent of our Nation's gross domestic product. \\n   Imports have helped to hold down inflation, lower the cost of production, provide greater choice to consumers, and have given incentives to raise productivity. \\n   As emerging markets seek to grow, it is important that the United States take the lead in offering these countries incentives to continue their economic reforms. By doing so, we will be providing the citizens of these emerging countries with more jobs, more opportunities and genuine hope. I believe a strong trade relationship is the best form of ``foreign assistance'' we can offer another country. \\n   I thank the chair, and I yield the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19991028\\n\\n   Mr. MACK.

Mr. President, I join my colleagues in paying tribute to the memory of our friend and colleague, Senator John Chafee. \\n   Senator Chafee was the living embodiment of Senate decorum. He always honored this body through his thoughts, deeds and actions. His ideas and messages were delivered thoughtfully and respectfully. He truly followed his heart and soul while representing the people of Rhode Island and this great nation. \\n   His honorable service in both World War II and the Korean Conflict, as well as his distinguished tenure as Secretary of the Navy, reflect his profound respect for America's armed forces and his deep love of country. \\n   I am especially appreciative for all he did to advance causes near and dear to the state of Florida. He took time to visit the Florida Everglades, and his work on this important issue will ensure the preservation of this unique natural system, and will always be a part of his lasting legacy. \\n   Senator Chafee devoted his life to public service. He will be remembered as a thoughtful and patriotic American who cared passionately about those he served, the issues he fought for, and the institution of the United States Senate. He was not only a fellow Republican, but a colleague who was respected on both sides of the aisle. He will be sorely missed in the U.S. Senate. \\n   My heartfelt sympathies go to his wife Ginny, to their five children and 12 grandchildren, and to his staff here in Washington and throughout Rhode Island. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19991021\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I extend a warm welcome to Father Dan this morning. He is our guest Chaplain this morning from Reynoldsburg, OH. I had the pleasure of meeting him a few moments ago, but in a sense I have known him for at least a number of years because my brother, Andrew McGillicuddy, is a member of his parish--Andy and Chris--and as a result of their request, Father Dan was able to join us this morning. He is the pastor of a church of 2,400 families, a great responsibility. We are delighted he is with us this morning. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19991021\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today the Senate will resume consideration of the pending Harkin amendment to the partial-birth abortion ban bill. By previous consent, there are 2 hours of debate on the amendment. Therefore, Senators can anticipate a vote at approximately 11:30 a.m., unless the time is yielded back on the amendment. Senators should be aware future rollcall votes are expected in an attempt to complete action on the bill prior to adjournment today. \\n   Following the completion of the partial-birth abortion ban bill, the Senate may begin consideration of any legislative items on the calendar or any conference reports available for action. \\n   I thank my colleagues for their attention. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19991021\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, Senator JOHN BREAUX, in introducing the Fuel Tax Equalization Credit for Substantial Power Takeoff Act. \\n   This bill would create a simple mechanism to reimburse owners of concrete mixers and sanitation trucks for the Federal excise taxes that they pay on fuels used to power the off-road function of their vehicles. \\n   Today, IRS regulations impose the Federal fuels excise tax on ``single engine, dual-use vehicles.'' Two prominent examples of such single-engine, dual-use vehicles are concrete mixers and sanitation trucks. The IRS taxes the entire amount of fuel used in these vehicles, despite the fact that a substantial portion of the fuel consumed is used to power an off-road function--the trash compactor of a sanitation truck, or the rotating drum of the cement truck. \\n   Mr. President, the Federal fuels excise tax is meant to pay for our Nation's roads. If fuel is used for an off-road purpose, it is a well-established principle that we do not tax the fuel. In this case, fuels used to power the trash compactor or rotate the drum on a concrete mixer do not result in wear and tear on the roads and, therefore, should not be taxes. \\n   Contrary to this well-established principle, the IRS imposes the excise tax on single engine, dual-use vehicles. The simple reason given by the IRS for this distinction is administrative convenience. But the convenience of the IRS is no reason to overtax diesel fuel consumers. \\n   Mr. President, our bill corrects the discrepancy created under IRS regulations, and does so without creating any administrative red tape. The $250 income tax credit crafted in the bill would be easy to administer. While it will not fully and precisely compensate these truck owners for the taxes paid on fuel used off-road, this credit has been calculated based on industry data and using conservative estimates, and reduces a tax that these truck owners should not be paying in the first place. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to join Senator BREAUX and me in supporting this important piece of legislation. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19991018\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Madam President, as Congress considers various plans to overhaul the current campaign finance system, I think everyone can agree on one fact: the status quo is indefensible. The system needs to change in order to restore the American people's faith in their government. \\n   The imbalances which exist in our election laws today were created by the Federal Election Campaign Act in the name of equality. They resulted in unfair advantages which are institutionalized in the name of fairness, protecting some forms of political speech while criminalizing others. Enacting more laws along the same lines will only lead us further down the path of destruction. Freedom matters. Freedom works. Free speech works. Free participation works. The current system does not. If we want real reform, we will scrap this bill, repeal current law, and start over. \\n   Campaign finance reformers think the solution is new regulations and methods that I believe work only to preclude participation in politics. They believe that new laws, more restrictions, and additional bureaucracy are the answer. This position is based upon the assumption that current laws are working and they just need a few modifications to make them better. I  strongly disagree. Freedom of expression is an end in itself and can not be subordinated to any other goals of society. Information is the backbone to freedom, ignorance is the backbone to oppression. \\n   Reformers tolerate these inequalities because they believe they will result in lower-cost elections, less influence in the process by special interests, and will make the electoral system more accessible to challengers. Even if these goals could be achieved in this way, the trampling of the First Amendment in the process is unacceptable. \\n   The fact is, current laws do not work. Let's admit that. We wouldn't be debating this issue if they did. They were passed in haste, as a knee-jerk reaction to the Watergate era, and while they were enacted with good intentions, their result has been a disaster. We should recognize that a mistake was made when the Federal Election Campaign Act was enacted, and no modifications to this law will improve the system. \\n   Campaign finance laws restricting free speech should be repealed, and the absolute freedom to engage in the political process should be promoted and defended. The American people should know that their participation is encouraged, respected, and welcome. If that participation includes fully disclosed contributions to candidates and parties, so be it. Disclosure is the key factor here. Let's give the American people some credit. They are smart enough to judge for themselves where conflicts of interest lie. They do not need the bureaucracy of the Federal Elections Commission to police their speech and thwart their involvement. The only job of the FEC should be the posting and reporting of all contributions in a timely manner so that the American people can judge for themselves. Current law is an insult to the intelligence of the American people. \\n   Soft money is perceived as a loophole in current law. Banning soft money is only one more step toward the elimination of free speech in elections. The First Amendment right to freedom of speech is not a loophole. It is a fundamental freedom that protects, among other things, political speech. Again, let Americans \\n   decide whether and to what extent they want to participate. \\n   We should be protecting freedom of speech over everything else. We should not enact legislation to preclude the public from voicing their opinions on the work we do here. We may not like what is said about us, but we can all agree that people have a right to speak their mind, especially their political mind. \\n   This bill also recognizes that current law does not protect working Americans' ability to decide which causes they will support. While this bill codifies the Beck decision which enables non-union workers to request a refund for the portion of their union fees used for political causes. If it does not address the concerns of union members who are forced to participate in political causes without their consent. \\n   No American should be faced with the direct or indirect threat of losing their job because of their political beliefs. No one should be forced to participate in advocating for a cause or causes they find repugnant. The rights of individuals to be free certainly extends to their political beliefs and the way in which they choose to participate or not to participate. No forced participation under any guise should be tolerated or encouraged. Let individuals make choices for themselves. That is the most fundamental freedom in a democracy. \\n   A vibrant democracy depends on the ability of all voices to be heard, and how loudly one may wish to speak should be limited only by that individual, not by government. If an individual can and is willing to expend over $1,000 in support of a candidate, they should be able to do so. If they wish to express their support with their time or in any other fashion, then this, too, should be applauded and encouraged. And if individuals wish to ignore the political process altogether, then this, too, is a right to be defended. To tinker with this fundamental right gives power to some at the expense of others. \\n   Finally, I would submit, that we need to re-examine our attitude toward money in the electoral process, and I would propose that spending money to communicate one's message is not the root of all evil in politics. Candidates for public office have the important task of getting their message out to the voters. In statewide races across the country, candidates must spend substantial amounts of money for print and electronic media, since it is the best current method of reaching the maximum audience. \\n   Take a moment and think about the power of the media today--television, newspapers and radio frame the debates of important issues. A candidate must be able to raise enough money to get his or her message out to the public. \\n   When I was campaigning for my Senate seat back in 1988, I faced enormous opposition from the newspapers. Newspapers have vast resources to openly campaign for a candidate. Had I not had the freedom and ability to counter their message, I would not be a Senator today. \\n   True reform will not strip candidates, parties, or individuals of their ability to counter the messages in the media. True reform should recognize the imbalance current law has created, and would seek to level the playing field between candidates and the media. Remember, the First Amendment protects freedom of the press, but it also protects the freedom of individuals to speak loud and clear. \\n   Madam President, I believe in the First Amendment. Protecting that right must be our primary goal. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19991005\\n\\n    Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from Maryland, Mr. SARBANES, to introduce the Debt Relief for Counties Act of 1999. This bill simply forgives much of the debt owed to us by the world's poorest countries in exchange for commitments from these countries to reform their economies and work toward a better quality of life for their people. Our effort today is premised on the fact that we must help these poverty-stricken nations break the vicious cycle of debt and give them the economic opportunity to liberate their futures. I ask my colleagues to join me in this worthwhile effort. \\n   Today, the world's poorest countries owe an average of $400 for every man, woman, and child within their borders. This is much more than most people in these countries make in a year. Debt service payments in many cases consume a majority of a poor country's annual budget, leaving scarce domestic resources for economic restructuring or such vital human services as education, clean water and sanitary living conditions. In Tanzania, for example, debt payments would require nearly four-fifths of the government's budget. In a country where one child in six dies before the age of five, little money remains to finance public health programs. Among Sub-Saharan African countries, one in five adults can't read or write, and it is estimated that in several countries almost half the population does not have access to safe drinking water. \\n   Mr. President, the problems that yield such grim statistics will never be solved without a monumental commitment of will from their leaders, their citizens, and the outside world. That is not what we propose to do here today. Our bill is only a small step in the right direction, but it is one we can do quickly and for relatively little cost. \\n   The effort to forgive the debts of the world's poorest countries has been ongoing for more than a decade. During this time the international community and the G7 came to the realization that the world's poorest countries are simply unable to repay the debt they owe to foreign creditors. The external debt for many of the developing nations is more than twice their GDP, leaving many unable to even pay the interest on their debts. We must accept the fact that this debt is unpayable. the question is not whether we'll ever get paid back, but rather what we can encourage these heavily indebted countries to do for themselves in exchange for our forgiveness. \\n   Our bill requires the President to forgive at least 90 percent of the entire bilateral debt owed by the world's heavily indebted poor countries in exchange for verifiable commitments to pursue economic reforms and implement poverty alleviation measures. While roughly $6 billion is owed to the United States by these poor countries, it is estimated the cost of forgiving this debt would be less than ten percent of that amount. The U.S. share of the bilateral debt is less than four percent of the total, but our action would provide leadership to the rest of the world's creditor nations and provide some savings benefits to these countries as well. \\n   Our bill also requires a restructuring of the IMF and World Bank's Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC). This program was begun in 1996, but to date only three countries \\n   have received any relief. While the premise of HIPC is sound, its shortcomings have become evident during the implementation. It promises much, but in reality it benefits too few countries, offers too little relief, and requires too long a wait before debt is forgiven. A process of reforming the HIPC was begun this year during the G7's meeting in Cologne, and our bill meets or exceeds the standards set out in the Cologne communique. \\n   Specifically, we shorten the waiting period for eligibility from six to three years. We extend the prospect of relief to more countries. And we ensure that savings realized from the relief will be used to enhance ongoing economic reforms in addition to initiatives designed to alleviate poverty. This is a sound and balanced approach to help these poor countries correct their underlying economic problems and improve the standard of living of their people. \\n   Mr. President, this legislation is not a handout to the developing world. Rather, it is an investment in these countries' commitment to implementing sound economic reforms and helping their people live longer, healthier and more prosperous lives. In order to receive debt relief under our bill, countries must commit the savings to policies that promote growth and expand citizens' access to basic services like clean water and education. \\n   We have included a strict prohibition in our bill on providing relief to countries that sponsor terrorism, spend excessively on their militaries, do not cooperate on narcotics matters, or engage in systematic violations of their citizens' human rights. We are not proposing to help any country that is not first willing to help itself. \\n   Mr. President, the debt accumulated in the developing world throughout the Cold War and into the 1990s has become a significant impediment to the implementation of free-market economic reforms and the reduction of poverty. We in the developed world have an interest in removing this impediment and providing the world's poorest countries with the opportunity to address their underlying economic problems and set a course for sustainability. \\n   I believe our bill is an important first step in this process and I look forward to the support of my colleagues in the Senate.  \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990928\\n\\n    Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend and colleague Senator ABRAHAM, to introduce the Merit Act, which is legislation to ensure that every classroom in America is staffed with a competent, qualified and caring teacher. Last Congress, the Senate debated a number of initiatives to further this goal and passed this legislation as an amendment to a comprehensive education reform bill, which was vetoed by the President. Earlier this year, I joined Senator GREGG in cosponsor the Teacher Empowerment Act. Both the TEA, and the MERIT ACT are important reform bills to enable local schools to staff their classrooms with the best and brightest teachers. \\n   The 21st Century begins in just under 100 days. If our children are to be prepared for the challenges ahead, educational excellence must become our first order of business. As Congress continues to focus on a number of important reforms to federal K-12 education policy, I strongly believe that any real education reform must confront the most basic, the most important, and the most neglected aspect of public education: the quality of instruction in the classroom. \\n   Parents all over the state of Florida, and I imagine the same is true around the country, are concerned that the success --or failure--of their child's entire academic year will be determined by the quality and expertise of their child's teacher. Studies show that the most important factor in determining student success on standardized tests is the teacher's ability to present the material. Studies also show that when a student is assigned an ineffective teacher, the damage is not limited to one year. In fact, student test scores do not recover for three years, even if their subsequent teachers are excellent. \\n   America's classrooms are staffed with many dedicated, knowledgeable, and hardworking teachers. Nevertheless, the case for sweeping reform is not difficult to make. While the United States already spends more money per pupil than virtually any industrialized democracy in the world, our children frequently score near the bottom in international exams in science and math. Without exceptional teaching, no amount of resources will be able to turn bad schools into good schools. Throwing more money at the problem is no longer the answer. \\n   Our schools and classrooms should be staffed with teachers who have the appropriate training and background. Students deserve teachers with a thorough knowledge of the subjects they are teaching and the ability to convey complex material in ways that students can understand. One way to determine the competency of teachers would be to test them on their knowledge of the subject areas they teach. \\n   At a time when states are raising the bar for student achievement, few are raising standards for teachers. Today, seven states have no licensing exams for new teachers, and of the \\n   43 states that do have licensing exams, only 29 require high school teachers to pass an exam in the subject they plan to teach. However, in many cases, these requirements are waived when there is a shortage of qualified candidates. \\n   We have a clear interest in ensuring that beginning teachers are able to meet high standards and are knowledgeable about the subject matter they are presenting, and a number of states have taken the initiative to test their prospective teachers. However, when you consider that many teachers--especially teachers in low income districts--do not even have a minor degree in the subject they teach, it is important to periodically evaluate the performance of all teachers. Schools are often strapped for good teachers and will simply staff a science class with a math teacher. These are cases where testing could provide valuable insight as to the mastery of the teacher in additional subjects, and would identify those teachers who need additional encouragement. \\n   Common sense also dictates that we should not concentrate all our attention on under-performing teachers. We must also recognize that there are many great teachers who are successfully challenging their students on a daily basis. Today, our public schools compensate teachers based almost solely on seniority, not on their performance inside the classroom. Merit-pay would differentiate between teachers who are hard-working and inspiring, and those who fall short. \\n   The legislation we are introducing today, known as the MERIT ACT--which stands for Measures to Enhance Results in Teaching --is the same legislation that passed the Senate last Congress with bipartisan support by a vote of 63-35. It rewards states that test its teachers on their subject matter knowledge, and pays its teachers based on merit. \\n   Here is how it works: we will make half of any additional funding over the FY 2000 level for the Eisenhower Professional Development Program available to states that periodically test elementary and secondary school teachers, and reward teachers based on merit and proven performance. There will be no reduction in current funding to states under this program based on this legislation. As funding increases for this program, so will the amount each state receives. Incentives will and should be provided to those states that take the initiative to establish teacher testing and merit pay programs. \\n   Again, I want to emphasize that all current money being spent on this program is unaffected by this legislation. Only additional money will be used as an incentive for states to enact teacher testing and merit pay programs. \\n   Finally, this legislation enables states to also use federal education money to establish and administer teacher testing and merit pay programs. This broad approach will enable states to staff their schools with the best and most qualified teachers, thereby enhancing learning for all students. In turn, teachers can be certain that all of their energy, dedication and expertise will be rewarded. And it can be done without placing new mandates on states or increasing the federal bureaucracy. \\n   It is interesting to note that as Governor of the State of Arkansas, Bill Clinton enthusiastically supported teacher testing, and as Governor of South Carolina, Secretary of Education Richard Riley advocated a merit-pay plan. In fact, then-Governor Clinton in 1984 said that he was more convinced than ever that competency tests were needed to take inventory of teachers' basic skills. He said, ``Teachers who don't pass the test shouldn't be in the classroom''. While President Clinton vetoed this legislation last year, I am hoping he will stand by his State of the Union address where he stated that new teachers should be required to pass performance exams and all teachers should know the subject matter they are teaching. \\n   I would also like to mention the important steps being taken by schools around the country to address the need for merit-based pay. Most recently, in Denver, Colorado, schools have reached an agreement with the unions to commence a two year demonstration program which will pay teachers based on  performance. It is important to note the two largest unions, the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers, have approached the Denver plan with an open mind. In this program, teachers can earn an additional $1500 by the end of an academic year if a majority of the teacher's students ``improve.'' I am encouraged by the initiative taken by Denver's schools to implement innovative approaches to teacher compensation, and I look forward to the continued cooperation of America's teacher unions. Without their cooperation, reforms to education in America are often frustrated. In the end, I believe teachers, administrators, parents and students will be able to devise a system that is fair and one that works to improve teacher and student performance alike. \\n   I look forward to working with my colleagues as we continue the fight to give dedicated professionals who teach our children a personal stake in the quality of the instruction they provide. I hope there will again be broad, bipartisan support for this bill.  \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-19990928\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, Senator GRAHAM and I rise again to introduce the Florida Coast Protection Act of 2000. This legislation will amend current law to give states the ability to have all pertinent environmental information on hand before they are forced to rule on oil and gas drilling development plans, and it would also implement a permanent ban on leasing in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico. \\n   Mr. President, Floridians have always been justifiably concerned about the prospect of oil and gas exploration in the waters off our coast. We are well aware of the risk this activity poses to our environment and our economy because, in Florida, a healthy environment means a healthy economy. Millions of people come to Florida each year to enjoy the climate, our beaches, and our fine quality of life. The tourism industry in Florida provides millions of jobs and generates revenues in the billion of dollars. It would take only one disaster to end Florida's good standing as America's vacationland. We cannot afford to let that happen. \\n   Throughout my tenure in the Senate I have opposed exploration and drilling off Florida's coasts. My goal--and the goal of the entire Florida Congressional delegation--is to permanently remove this threat from Florida's coast. In recent years, we have stood together in opposition to drilling and have successfully extended the annual moratorium on all new leasing activities on Florida's continental shelf. While the opposition of Floridians to oil drilling is well-documented, the reality remains that leases have been issued, potential drilling sites have been explored, and it is likely that actual extraction of resources could take place within the next few years. \\n   In order to prevent a repeat of the past mistake of leasing in the OCS off Florida, our legislation makes permanent the ban on any new leasing activity within 100 miles of our coast. In addition, it gives states the flexibility to make a determination regarding the consistency of oil and gas development and production plans as required by the Coastal Zone Management Act after an environmental impact statement detailing the direct and cumulative impacts of the project is completed by the Minerals Management Service. \\n   It is this second provision which is so important. Many in this body may not be aware that my state is currently engaged in a battle to keep drilling rigs off its coasts. In the process, the government of the state of Florida was forced, by current law, to make a consistency determination on a pending development plan without the benefit of the environmental impact statement. In fact, the state was forced to conclude that the plan is inconsistent with its own coastal zone management  program months before the environmental impact statement was concluded. As I stand here, the EIS for this development plan is still not finalized and its draft is currently the subject of public hearings. Without the benefit of this detailed study, the state is unable to accurately assess the primary, secondary and cumulative impacts drilling will have on our coast, estuaries, marine life and our economy. No state should be put in a similar position and our bill seeks to correct this. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990924\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Given the merits of the project, we were disappointed that Barry University was not included in the legislation before us that allocates funds to the ``Economic Development Initiatives'' for such purposes. Barry University's proposal meets the criteria established by the Subcommittee in terms of serving low-income populations. Our hope is that this project can be re-considered during final deliberations on the bill. Specifically, we would request that favorable language be included in this bill directing the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to spend a minimum of 1.5 million dollars from the Economic Development Initiative fund to finance this important program that promotes economic and social revitalization. We would appreciate the Senator's support, along with the Chairman's in the funding of the Barry University Intercultural Community Center in the Conference Report. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990922\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend from Florida, Senator GRAHAM, to engage the distinguished Chairman, Senator BOND, in a colloquy. Specifically, I wish to make the Chairman aware of an important priority for the State of Florida which was not funded in this bill. Last year, the public housing reform act passed by Congress contained authorization for the construction of a community services student union building at Bethune-Cookman College in Daytona Beach, Florida. Accordingly, we included this project as one of our important priorities for the legislation before us today. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-19990922\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I thank the Chairman for his assurances. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-3-19990922\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend from Florida, Senator GRAHAM, to engage the distinguished Chairman, Senator BOND, in a colloquy. Specifically, I wish to make the Chairman aware of two critical projects in Florida that did not receive funding in this bill. The first is the City of West Palm Beach's water reuse project. This wetlands-based potable water reuse program is critical not only to the water supply of the City of West Palm Beach but also to the Everglades restoration effort. \\n   During dry season, the City takes water from Lake Okeechobee which is a critical primary source of water for the Everglades. West Palm Beach is attempting to eliminate this water use through their innovative water reuse project. The City has received federal support in each of the past three fiscal years. Work is progressing on schedule, but a final installment of federal funding is needed to complete the work and bring the project on line. \\n   I would point out to the Chairman that this project is funded in the House VA/HUD and Independent Agencies appropriations bill. I would urge the Chairman to work with our House colleagues during the upcoming conference to ensure that funding for this critical project is completed in this fiscal year. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-4-19990922\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I thank the Chairman for his assurances. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-5-19990922\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend from Florida, Senator GRAHAM, to engage the distinguished Chairman, Senator BOND, in a colloquy. Specifically, I wish to make the Chairman aware of an important priority for the State of Florida which was not funded in this bill. The city of Sarasota, Florida has long been working with the federal government to address its water treatment system problems. Many of the city's residents are still on septic tanks and the federal government has been interested in addressing this problem because of polluted runoff into the Sarasota Bay National Estuary. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-6-19990922\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I thank the Chairman for his assurances. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990914\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. The Refuge currently co-exists with Florida's Space Coast. However, sea turtle nesting at this site is sensitive to impacts from development and human activity. To mitigate these impacts, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service coordinates with the local and state governments regarding joint management of beaches, index nesting beach surveys, public education programs, and appropriate public use facilities. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990805\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I thank my distinguished colleague for yielding me that time. \\n   Mr. President, the vote on our tax relief bill is nothing less than a vote of confidence, reaffirmation of our belief in the wisdom of the American people and of our faith in the capitalist system. It all boils down to one basic, fundamental question: who has first claim on the income of Americans--does it belong to the government or to the individual families who create the income through the sweat of their brows and the genius of their (brains?) \\n   The President and the vast majority of our friends on the other side of the aisle act like the money belongs to the  government. They reject our tax relief bill as ``too big,'' as if taxpayers earn income at the sufferance of the government. Under this view, Uncle Sam does not live under a budget he sets the budget for every American family, which must be content with the table scraps after the enormous appetite for spending in Washington has been satiated. \\n   Two and one-quarter centuries ago, the rejection of this arrogant, government-comes-first theory of taxation was the impetus for the founding of our Nation. Our political forefathers would not stand for the notion that Americans were mere pawns of a distant court, which could raid their purses and pocketbooks at any whim. America was founded not on concepts that divide peoples, such as race, or geography, but on the American Idea that brings us all together: the inalienable right to liberty. \\n   From our Nation's very conception, this idea has served as a beacon for people of all creeds and colors seeking refuge from he heavy hand of meddlesome government. In America, the government serves the people, and must necessarily trust the people to do what is right by and for themselves. The government should not try to do it all. We provide a safety net for the least fortunate, those who cannot help themselves, but everyone else is trusted with the responsibility of providing for their own financial security. \\n   And by all accounts, this combination of liberty for our citizens and restraint on the part of the public sector has, in fact, succeeded. By the end of the 19th Century, America was in the forefront of the Industrial Revolution. By the mid-20th Century, despite the MIRE of a worldwide depression, the United States was able to mobilize its industries and its men to rout one own of the twin evils of tyranny in the Second World \\n   War. And by the close of this Century, we succeeded in defeating the other Soviet Communism, by the force of our will, the commitment of a strong Commander-in-Chief, Ronald Reagan, and the power of our competing idea of liberty. Our Nation is President Reagan's shining city on a hill, the economic envy of the world and the destination of all who yearn for freedom. \\n   But this President and his supporters in the Congress just don't get it. The tax burden on our citizens is at an all time, peacetime high--20.6 percent of the economy. Meanwhile, the federal government will be overcharging the taxpayers by more than $3 trillion over the next 10 years. A Nation that trusted its people, that protected their liberty, would not flinch from the right thing to do: cut taxes so that our families can enjoy the fruits of their labors, instead of greedy Washington programs. This tax bill does just that, leaving $792 billion in the hands of the people to whom it belongs. \\n   This tax cut is a measured, balanced response to the surpluses that will be flowing into the capital. It leaves 75% of the surpluses to be used to retire debt, and finance important priorities like Medicare and national defense. Every penny in the Social Security trust fund is left in a lockbox to be used to shore up the retirement security of our citizens. And the tax cuts are phased in over time, so the bulk of the cuts are in the last 3 years of the coming decade, when surpluses would otherwise skyrocket and tempt a government spending spree. \\n   But voices are raised in opposition to the tax cut. It is said that the government cannot afford a tax cut of this size. But that is exactly backwards: our taxpayers cannot afford to continue to shoulder a record-high tax burden. Back in 1993, without the vote of a single Republican member of Congress, President Clinton pushed through a tax increase totaling $241 billion over 5 years. The rationale for this tax increase was the need to reduce our budget deficit. Well, the budget deficit is gone and we now have surpluses as far as the eye can see. The on-budget, non-Social Security surpluses will exceed $1 trillion over the next decade. We propose to let the American people keep $792 billion of these overpayments. Is that too much? \\n   Not when you consider that the 5-year tax cut of $156 billion pales in comparison to the Clinton tax hike, imposed \\n   on what was then a much smaller economy. According to my Joint Economic Committee staff, the 1993 Clinton tax increases will take some $900 billion from the American people over the next decade. Our tax cut of $792 billion does not even offset the lingering ill effects of that tax hike. Are we being too generous? Or have the taxpayers been too generous for too long? \\n   It is hard to find fault with the specifics of our tax cut package. Is it right that we should double-tax business investments, so our innovators lack the resources for research and development? Is it wrong to extend the R&D tax credit, to liberate our scientists and engineers? Is it right that people should pay higher taxes just because they are married? Do we want people to build their own nest eggs for retirement security, or do we want to force everyone to rely exclusively on the Social Security system? \\n   This tax relief package helps everyone. We make health and long-term care insurance fully deductible, and allow a dependent deduction for elderly family members. Education is more affordable through enhanced savings vehicles--IRAs and pre-paid tuition plans. Tax rates are lowered across-the-board. We eliminate the marriage penalty for taxpayers in the lowest tax bracket and repeal the Alternative Minimum Tax for individuals. \\n   Most significant is what this tax relief does for our future. As we enter the 21st Century, America needs a tax policy that will facilitate, not smother, innovation and new technology. Our tax relief bill improves the environment for pioneers in new products and services. The R&D tax credit is extended for 5 years--the longest extension ever, so business can count on it. The R&D credit will continue to fuel innovation in new technologies, leading to health and safety breakthroughs, and enriching our quality of life. \\n   Capital gains tax rates are also cut to their lowest levels in 58 years. Lower taxes on capital gains will help our entrepreneurs find the seed capital they need to launch new businesses, create new jobs and provide new products and services. And capital gains are indexed, eliminating the tax on phantom gains due to inflation--ending the government raid on the savings of long-term investors, particularly retirees. \\n   We also eliminate the most unfair tax of all, the estate \\n   and gift tax. No longer will business owners be discouraged from reinvesting their hard-earned profits because the specter of the federal death tax is hovering, waiting to swoop down and scoop up 55 percent of the increased value of the business. By eliminating the death tax, cutting the capital gains tax, and expanding IRAs, some of the largest barriers to capital formation are pulled down, and the result should be a rising tide of investment that carries our economy through the coming Century of Knowledge. \\n   I want to commend Chairman ROTH, and all of the conferees, for producing a balanced, thorough, and fair tax cut that benefits all taxpayers. High taxes are an infringement on the liberty of our families, who should not be struggling to make ends meet while their Federal servants hoard the wealth our families have created. When the question comes down to whether we trust the Federal Government or the family to use money wisely, I choose the family every time. I urge my colleagues to do the same, to side with the people, not the bureaucracy, and vote for the conference report. \\n   I yield the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990805\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from Florida, Mr. GRAHAM, to address briefly the issue of Everglades restoration and land acquisition funding. We had joined with the President in requesting slightly more than $100 million for land acquisition in Everglades National Park, state assistance grants, infrastructure investment, and modified water deliveries to the Park and Florida Bay. This funding is critical to keep the restoration effort on budget, on schedule, and consistent with the Congress' commitment in 1997 to fully fund Everglades restoration. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-19990805\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, the reservations of the Subcommittee are valid ones and my colleague from Florida and I are willing to be helpful however we can in addressing these concerns. I would say to the Chairman that we are making progress on these issues. The Department of the Interior tells me it is working closely with the State of Florida to remove the barriers to allocating the unobligated land acquisition and restoration balances. The Department assures these funds will be obligated by the end of this fiscal year. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-3-19990805\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I would ask the Chairman of the Subcommittee if he would be willing--given the movement toward resolving his concerns since release of the Committee's report--if he would be willing to work with us in Conference to increase the overall Everglades funding from the levels currently in the bill? \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-4-19990805\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I thank my colleague for his response and assurances on this important issue. I would also like to mention briefly the funding level for the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force. It is my understanding the Task Force's funding has been kept steady at $800,000 since it was statutorily authorized in 1996. I want to bring this matter to the Chairman's attention because of the restraints this low funding ceiling is placing on the Task Force's ability to carry out its mission in South Florida. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-5-19990805\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I thank my friend from Washington and yield the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990805\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join my colleagues, Senator MIKULSKI, Senator WELLSTONE, and Senator GRAMS, in sponsoring the Medicare's Elderly Receiving Innovative Treatments (MERIT) Act of 1999. \\n   This legislation ensures that frail elderly persons residing in nursing homes continue to have the opportunity for improved quality of care and better health outcomes provided by the EverCare program. This program is reimbursed by Medicare on a capitated fee basis to managed care organizations that deliver preventive and primary medical care geared to the special needs of this population. Care is given by nurse practitioner/physician primary care teams which also coordinate care when the patient is hospitalized. Ideally, as much care as possible is provided at the nursing home thus preventing the expense of hospitalization. A major goal is to maintain stability in the patients' life by caring for them in their place of residence. The typical patient is over 85, 82 percent are female, 75 percent are on Medicaid and 70 percent have dementia. \\n   The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) requires the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) to establish a new risk-adjusted methodology for payments to health plans which is to go into effect on January 1, 2000. An interim risk adjusted payment will be based on inpatient hospital encounter data. However, an unintended consequence of this methodology may be a dramatic drop in EverCare payments by more than 40 percent, according to Long Term Care Data Institute study. This would jeopardize the program, which is currently comprised of demonstration and non-demonstration components, since providers could not afford to remain in business. HCFA recognized the possibly of this and did grant an exemption from the interim methodology for one year, 2000-2001. HCFA, however, has not yet presented a methodology that would be fair and adequate to ensure the continuance of EverCare. \\n   This legislation exempts programs serving the frail elderly living in nursing homes from the phased in risk-adjustment payment methodology and continues payments using the current system. It directs HCFA to develop a distinct payment methodology which meets the needs of these patients and to establish performance measurement standards. It also allows the frail elderly to join EverCare on a continual basis without regard to enrollment periods. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990804\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition to the amendment before us today by the Senator from Mississippi. While I know my friends who support this amendment have the best of intentions in offering the agricultural relief package, I must say I am concerned with the direction of this debate. \\n   We find ourselves today, Mr. President, in an increasingly familiar place. Once again, there is a crisis in farm country and the Congress is called on to construct a comprehensive package of relief and support. The amendment before us would spend more than $7 billion on--among other things--direct cash payments to farmers. This follows our efforts last year when we provided just short of $6 billion in emergency payments to America's farmers. Since 1988 emergency supplemental acts and farm disaster acts have amounted to approximately $17 billion in emergency supplemental funding for USDA programs. \\n   Now I understand that much of this money was spent helping farmers who had suffered crop losses through drought, seasonal storms and other natural disasters. In fact, a portion of last year's emergency appropriations went to farmers who were harmed by weather conditions related to the El Nino phenomenon and other acts of God. \\n   In other words, we were attempting to help farmers in previous years because times were bad. What concerns me about this effort today is that we are helping farmers because times are good. Increasingly in these relief bills we are seeing the bulk of support going in response to low commodity prices. In fact, much of the rhetoric we're hearing is going to the issue of declining farm income and the difficulty farmers in the heartland and elsewhere are having finding markets for their goods. \\n   Today we're not addressing a crisis borne of declining productivity. It is not that America's farmer's aren't extremely good at what they do. Rather exactly the opposite. We are here because--stimulated by science and technology--farm productivity has persistently grown more rapidly than other sectors of the economy. More importantly, agricultural productivity has outstripped demand. And it leaves us faced with the one of the most basic economic functions: in the face of overwhelming supply and insufficient demand, prices will fall. \\n   In nearly all sectors, this phenomenon is a quiet one. The ``unseen hand'' of the market in most cases allocates resources among the population and prevents market saturation. But in the farm sector, Congress is often asked to intervene in this process and all too often in the past, we have. For far too long, we have allowed politics rather than economics to allocate agricultural resources and determine business success or failure. As seen by the overwhelming failure this century of centrally planned economies across the globe, political allocation leads to economic stagnation and long-term failure. \\n   It is for these reasons I fear our continued subsidization of the farm sector thwarts the free market process and will ultimately harm well-run farms by enabling continued market saturation. I understand the production of food is essential to the past and future of our country. I also recognize the instability and risk farmers face on a year to year basis and appreciate the need for occasional assistance. The New York Times, for example, contains an article yesterday discussing the drought disaster facing farmers in Maryland and West Virginia and the need for assistance in those areas. I do not discount the need for federal disaster relief. In Florida, Agriculture is a major part of our economy, and certainly there have been circumstances when we've called on Congress to assist us after hurricanes or winter freezes. These natural events warrant Congressional consideration and our best efforts. However, it seems our debate here is increasingly about politics rather than economics or weather-related disasters. \\n   In 1996, the Congress passed a Farm Bill which provided farmers of our major export crops with direct payments to transition them off the old subsidy programs and onto the free market. These direct payments were supposed to diminish each year until 2002. Instead, we are here--for the second year in a row--considering legislation to increase these payments. Once again, Congress is using emergency payments to undo the 1996 Farm Bill and circumvent the free market. I hear my colleagues blaming the free market for price failures and I find this to be a somewhat misguided notion. In fact, the market is working all too well; the overcapacity in agriculture that was papered over by government price supports for generations is now in full view. And the results are evident in the low commodity prices we're seeing on the markets today. \\n   I support the ideals and practices of family farming. I do not, however, support continually subsidizing businesses that fail. This is wasteful and destructive. By paying farmers who are unable to make profits in farming, you only delay their ultimate failure, and deter them from seeking other alternatives for income and employment. In addition, these farms that would otherwise fail still can produce crops that dilute the market and drive prices down, thereby creating a vicious cycle that we are seeing realized in this year's crisis in farm country. \\n   This problem far outstrips any two-day debate on emergency cash payments for farmers. What we need, Mr.  President, is long-term structural solutions that solve the underlying problems of oversupply in the face of insufficient world demand. One major impediment to the movement of people out of the farming sector and into other areas of the economy is the punitive capital gains taxes owed by farmers who sell their land. I will be introducing legislation soon to repeal the capital gains tax on the sale of farmland. This will allow farmers to realize an additional dollar in five on the sale of their land. They can then use this money to help them in the transition to non-farm businesses or work. While I agree with my colleagues that we need solutions to the crisis in American agriculture, I submit we need solutions that solve the underlying economic problems rather than patchwork measures that do little more than treat the symptoms and defer the problem to another year and another Congress. \\n   Mr. President, my opposition to this amendment is not based on a disdain or lack of appreciation for American agriculture. On the contrary, I believe it is a vital part of our economy and food security is clearly in our national interest. But the farming way of life is not served by government handout and bailouts of alarming size and regularity. Rather--like most other businesses--it is only preserved through sound business practices, hard work and an understanding of market fundamentals. Agriculture does not operate outside of the laws of supply and demand, and I urge my colleagues to carefully consider the long-term impact of continual subsidization on this important sector of the American economy. \\n   I hope my colleagues will oppose this amendment and explore ways to help farmers who are facing natural disasters rather than price disasters. We cannot allow the short-term politics to deter us from the long-term effort to steer agriculture towards the free market. Nobody wants to see failure in America. Nobody wants to see families lose their farms. Nobody wants the agrarian way of life in America to fade from existence. For these very reasons, Congress has an obligation to stay the course and lay the free-market groundwork for a prosperous farm economy. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990804\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the amendment my colleague from Florida, Senator GRAHAM, and I have offered on behalf of the Florida Center for Climate Prediction. \\n   The Center is a consortium between the University of Florida, Florida State University and the University of Miami to study climate variability in the Southeast region. The objective of this unique partnership is to explore the potential value and practical application for long-term climate data and science to the agricultural community in my state and throughout the Southeast. \\n   The consortium's purpose is to develop and evaluate a useful set of tools and methodologies for assessing the regional agricultural consequences of the El Nino/La Nina phenomenons and applying these forecasts to agricultural decision-making. This is a truly innovative project and I am pleased this partnership is making good progress on these important agricultural issues. \\n   Our amendment will provide $300,000 in funding for the Center in the Federal administration section of the Cooperative State Research and Education, and extension Service [CSREES]--Research and Education Activities section of the bill before us today. I appreciate the support my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee provided this important research initiative.  \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990804\\n\\n    Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990803\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I thank the Chair. \\n   First, I want to address a point that was made a few moments ago, an argument that went something like this: If we were to open up our markets, that action would, in essence, allow terrorists or countries to buy more food products. I just think that is fundamentally wrong. I think in fact they are buying all of the product that they can afford to buy now. And I would make the case that if they buy the product from us at a cheaper price because of it being subsidized, we are in fact subsidizing terrorist states. \\n   So I just fundamentally disagree with where the proponents of this amendment are going. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-19990803\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Sure. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-3-19990803\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Again, I say to my colleague who has raised this question that I do find it strange that at just the time when Members are coming to the floor and asking the American taxpayer to come to the aid of the American farmer, they are at the same time asking us to lift sanctions to allow them to sell products to terrorist states. \\n   I think, in fact, there is a connection between what is happening today--that is, some $6-$7 billion, depending on what this bill finally turns out to produce, $8-$9 billion in aid to American farmers, just after a few months ago with the additional aid to the American farmer--that you would find it appropriate to say to the American taxpayer: Now that you have given us this aid, we would like to have permission to sell our product to terrorist countries. I just find that unsupportable. \\n   I thank the Senator for raising the question. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-4-19990803\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. It clearly is a subsidy to the American farmer. What kind of effect it will have on the world price I do not think I am qualified to say. But it seems to me it is clear that if in fact there is a subsidy being received by the American farmer, that farmer could sell the product at a lower price.  \\n   I thank the Senator for his question. \\n   Mr. President, I oppose trade with tyrants and dictators, and I emphatically oppose subsidized trade with terrorist states. Again, make no mistake, that is exactly what this amendment does. Specifically, with my colleagues from Florida, New Jersey, and the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, we oppose the amendment to prevent any action by this body to limit the President of the United States' ability to impose sanctions on terrorist states. \\n   We had a similar vote last year, in which 67 Senators voted to oppose trade with terrorists. At the risk of stating the obvious, let me try to explain once again why the Senate should not change this position. \\n   Freedom is not free. I know my colleagues understand this simple axiom--this self-evident truth. But today we hear from our colleagues that the farmers of our Nation are undergoing a difficult time. So today, they have put before us a fundamental question: Does this great Nation, the United States of America, support freedom, or do we support terror? \\n   A few weeks ago, as I was preparing a statement on another issue, I came across a letter from His Holiness, the Dalai Lama of Tibet. In this letter the Dalai Lama says, and I quote, ``America's real strength comes not from its status as a `superpower' but from the ideals and principles on which it was founded.'' \\n   How may times have my colleagues been with me when a visiting head of state delivered to us the same message as the Dalai Lama's? I will provide one example. \\n   Last summer, the President of Romania addressed a joint session of Congress. He began his remarks by reminding us that Romania considered the United States the country of freedom and the guardian of fundamental human rights all over the world. He went on to say:  \\n   Throughout its history, your country has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed and the needy, a source of inspiration for the creative, the courageous and the achieving. It has always been, and may it ever remain, the land of the free and the home of the brave.  \\n   We are a nation founded on principles--the principles of freedom, liberty, and the respect for human dignity. And our commitment to these principles gives us our real strength today. It is that simple. \\n   I began this statement by posing a question on freedom versus terror. We know, even take for granted, the answer to that question--the United States opposes terror. But what about the strength or our commitment to these principles? On occasion, a short-term crisis can blind us--cause us to lose sight of our values and their importance to who we are and from where we derive our strength. \\n   Today's debate typifies one such moment. The poster which has been shown on this floor indicates the issue before us with respect to terrorist nations and their leaders--Qadhafi, Castro, and others. \\n   In exchange for very limited market expansion, some would take away the President's authority to restrict trade with six terrorist regimes--six countries whose combined markets represent a mere 1.7 percent of global agricultural imports; yet these minor importers perpetrate or harbor those who commit the world's greatest acts of terror. \\n   Some would have us open trade in agricultural products with these terrorists--in effect placing our principles up for sale. So what is the strength of our commitment to these principles? If we are to choose freedom over terror, what price should we expect to pay? There can be no doubt in anyone's mind the value of our commitment to freedom certainly exceeds the U.S. share of 1.7 percent of the world's agriculture market. \\n   But for those who may actually find this less clear than I do, it gets easier. The request by those who wish to trade with terrorists gets more extreme. With this amendment to language providing subsidies of U.S. agriculture, we are in effect being asked to subsidize global terrorism. The supporters of this amendment are asking the taxpayers of the United States to subsidize American farmers, who will then sell to terrorist states. \\n   The United States must not subsidize terrorist regimes. I find it unconscionable that we would even consider such a proposal. When two countries engage in a trade, even if just one commodity is being exported, both countries benefit from the exchange. So by opening agriculture exports to Iran, Sudan, Cuba, Iraq, Libya, and North Korea, we are offering direct support to the regimes in power. If they chose to purchase from the United States, they would be doing so because they see it as being in their best interest. Their benefit would be greater in this case because the products sold to terrorists would be subsidized by the U.S. taxpayer. \\n   Terrorism poses a direct threat to the United States. The terrorist threat was considerable during the cold war when the Soviet Union and its allies often backed movements or governments that justified the use of terror. The threat is even greater today, when chemical or biological weapons, no bigger than a suitcase, can bring death and devastation to tens of thousands of people. \\n   The deaths in the World Trade Center bombing or in Pan Am 103 remind of us what terrorism can produce. Another important reminder is the image of American humanitarian aircraft being blown out of the sky by Cuban Air Force MiG fighters in the Florida Straits. We are moving from a world where terrorists use dynamite or rifles to one where they may use a weapon of mass destruction. The world today is more dangerous in many ways than it was 10 years ago, and the form of that danger is terrorism, which makes it even more dangerous for the United States to engage in trade with terrorist states. \\n   So where does this leave us? With this simple principle--the United States must not trade with any nation that supports terrorism in any way, direct or indirect. We must insist that there can be no business-as-usual approach to nations that threaten our national security and national interests. We are well aware of the counterarguments. If we don't sell, some other country will, so what is the point? Or why not sell food? You can't turn wheat into a bomb, can you? Well, maybe not, but it is possible for a government that supports terror to use our food exports to win popular support, and it is possible to use the money saved by purchasing subsidized American goods for yet more terror. \\n   We can all agree that the United States must stand for freedom and against terror, and I hope the strength of our commitment to this principled stand runs deep. Today we are being asked how deeply are we committed to opposing terrorism. Make no mistake, our principles provide the real source of America's strength. If we are serious about battling terrorism, there can be no compromise with terror and no trade with terrorist nations. \\n   Mr. President, I yield the floor. \\n   Mr. FITZGERALD addressed the Chair. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990803\\n\\n    Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of the Teacher Empowerment Act, which is legislation introduced by my friend and colleague Senator GREGG. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this legislation, which responds to several critical needs facing American education. In particular, it addresses teacher quality and quantity. It addresses local control of educating our children. It requires accountability to parents and students. In short, it is a plan to ensure that every child in America is prepared for global competition in the 21st Century. \\n   The Teacher Empowerment Act recognizes the expertise of our state and local governments in educating our children. American parents trust their teachers and principals to make appropriate educational decisions for their children. In reality, Washington bureaucrats have called the shots for far too long. The results indicate that in lieu of achievement, we now have reams of paperwork and a myriad of programs to address local problems at the national level. We can and must do better. \\n   The Teacher Empowerment Act puts decision making authority back into the hands of local schools. It encourages states to implement innovative teacher reforms and high quality professional development programs to increase teacher knowledge and student achievement. Local schools would be encouraged to fund innovative programs such as teacher testing--a concept which I have strongly supported and which this body supported last year in a bipartisan vote--as well as tenure reform, merit-based pay, alternative routes to teacher certification, differential and bonus pay for teachers in high need subject areas, teacher mentoring, and in-service teacher academies. \\n   Our children are counting on us to ensure that they receive an education second to none. That starts with exceptional teachers and schools that are  able to address the individual needs of its students. This bill returns to local schools the ability and authority to accomplish these goals. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.  \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990729\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I would like to talk a few minutes about one particular provision in the tax bill we are debating, the extension of the Research & Development tax credit. Last week the Finance Committee took an historic step, and reported a bill which would have made the R&D tax credit a permanent feature of our tax code. Yesterday, unfortunately, every single member of the minority voted to sunset the provisions of the tax bill, so instead of a permanent R&D tax credit, we have a ten-year extension. \\n   Though the actions of our colleagues across the aisle prevented us from having a permanent R&D tax credit, I am pleased that the on-again, off-again nature of the credit will not undermine America's innovators for the next decade. I have long supported federal policies to increase the nation's R&D investment because of the central importance of scientific research to the health and well-being of our people, its positive contribution to our economic growth and our higher standard of living, and the improvements which add to our quality of life. \\n   Both business and government play important and complementary roles in making sure that America continues to lead the world in research and innovation. The federal role in R&D is focused on investment in long-term basic research. I will continue to do my best to increase federal R&D spending on basic research, particularly on biomedical research which leads to huge benefits to all Americans. \\n   Today, private industry plays the largest role in the nation's research effort, funding 65% of all R&D. Industry's role makes it clear ..... that if overall R&D is to increase, we must pursue policies which create a good business climate for firms to pursue long-term increases in their R&D budgets. We want America's leading-edge companies to hire new scientists, invest in new technologies and new research facilities--and the R&D tax credit provides that crucial incentive. \\n   To see the benefits of R&D, look no further than America's economic performance today. We are in the eighth consecutive year of non-inflationary growth, and technology industries deserve a large share of the credit. In fact, high-tech industries have accounted for about one-third of real GDP growth in recent years. \\n   Advancements from R&D lead to a huge number of improvements to our quality of life. The most dramatic impact of R&D on our quality of life is evident in biomedical research and health care. Here are some examples of the payoff to medical R&D: \\n   It used to be that patients with kidney failure had to undergo frequent transfusions, which are expensive, carry substantial risks, and leave many patients anemic. Many kidney patients had to cut back on work or quit their jobs, or go on public assistance. Through extensive R&D, one of America's top biotech companies created a new drug that allows the body to create red blood cells again and enables people to restore their energy. In the past decade, this drug has helped millions to remain productive. It has reduced transfusions in the United States by nearly one-fifth, and fewer people have contracted blood-born disease. \\n   Another example of the real-life benefits from R&D is the new class of drugs, developed in the late 1980s, which are giving millions of people who suffer from depression a new lease on life. Because of these new depression drugs, the cost of treating depression in the United States has plummeted--expensive psychiatric care and in-patient stays, which many could not afford, are now disappearing in favor of these new treatments. \\n   There are two telecommunications companies which invested in R&D to create new technologies to bring state-of-the-art medicine to previously underserved and remote locations. These new technologies allow transfer of high-resolution photographs, radiological images, sounds, and medical records from leading medical centers to physicians and patients in remote locations. \\n   These are just a few of hundreds of great success stories coming out of America's medical research labs--successes coming from companies responding to the R&D tax credit incentive. These examples make clear that R&D is not simply a dollars and cents issue. Federal R&D policy makes improvements to the quality of life across-the-board for all Americans. \\n   The R&D tax credit has proven its effectiveness. Numerous studies during the past decade have found that each dollar of tax credits generates between $1 and $2 of additional R&D. Therefore, taxpayers are getting a solid return on their investment in terms of greater economic growth, a higher standard of living, and in numerous cases--a longer and healthier life span. \\n   As chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, last month, along with Senator BENNETT, I hosted a high-tech summit which brought together business leaders from all across the high technology industries. One issue everyone seemed to agree on was that a permanent R&D tax credit would advance the development of new technologies, leading to breakthroughs which benefit the environment, increase transportation safety, treat serious illnesses and save lives. And on top of all this, a Coopers & Lybrand study found that a permanent extension to the credit would raise American incomes due to higher productivity growth and contribute substantially to our economic growth. \\n   The R&D tax credit has proven its worth many times over. Mr. President, though I am pleased we have extended R&D for 10 years, it is my hope that the R&D tax credit will one day be a permanent fixture in our Tax Code so it can spur innovation and economic growth throughout the next millennium. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990729\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join my colleagues, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, Mr. HELMS and Mr. ROBB, in sponsoring the Medicare Return to Home Act of 1999. \\n   This legislation will ensure that senior citizens enrolled in Medicare+Choice health plans who normally reside in continuing care retirement communities or nursing homes have the opportunity to return to the same facility after a period of hospitalization. Many of the retirement communities contain fully licensed facilities established to provide skilled nursing services to their residents when required them. Often, people choose a continuing care retirement community because of the different levels of care that will be available to them as they age in that community. These living arrangements allow couples and individuals to maintain their independence by having the ability to move in and out of various levels of care according to their needs over time. People who are fully independent when they move into a residential community often require assisted living, skilled nursing care or some other assistance over the course of their lifetime in residence. \\n   An increasing number of seniors have chosen Medicare+Choice plans as the way that they wish to receive health care services under Medicare. These plans reduce the potential for substantial out-of-pocket costs for the very sick which might be the experience with the traditional original Medicare plan. \\n   One unfortunate consequence of the Medicare+Choice option involves the inability of seniors to return to their chosen community or nursing home where they resided following a period of hospitalization. Some Medicare+Choice plans will only permit patients to be discharged from the hospital to a facility with which the Medicare+Choice plan has a contract. Then, patients cannot return to the residential community that they selected, which may have been chosen because it included a skilled nursing facility. Nor can they return to the nursing home in which they had previously resided. This can be traumatic for frail elderly patients and may contribute to their disorientation and impede their recovery. It places them in an unfamiliar setting away from home, possibly separating them from a spouse and friends. Staff at their chosen retirement community or nursing home may also be familiar with their individual needs and habits which could only assist in their return to wellness. It makes little sense for them to be sent elsewhere upon discharge from a hospital. \\n   Passage of this legislation ensures the ability of Medicare+Choice beneficiaries to return to the residential home facility of their choice or nursing home in which they previously resided following hospitalization under the following conditions: \\n   1. The enrollee chooses to return to the residential community facility where they had been living. \\n   2. The facility is licensed and qualified under state and federal law to provide the required services. \\n   3. The residential community or nursing home agrees to accept the managed care plan's payment which must be similar to the payment made to contracted facilities. \\n   This legislation provides for continuity in the lives of the elderly following a period of hospitalization. It does not increase costs to Medicare+Choice plans or to beneficiaries. \\n   It allows people to return to their loved ones in the facility where they have chosen to live. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990728\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, although I agree with many of the specific provisions in the Democrat alternative tax package--including a few bills that I have introduced--I must rise in opposition to this amendment. The plain fact is that the tax cut offered is just too small. We have budget instructions to cut taxes by $792 billion over the next 10 years, and we should cut taxes by $792 billion. \\n   I am glad I have this opportunity to talk about tax cuts, one of my favorite subjects. \\n   We are in the midst of what should be a very easy task: reducing the tax burden on our citizens by $792 billion over the next ten years. After all, over the next decade, the federal government is on track to collect over $3 trillion dollars more than we have budgeted for spending. \\n   In other words, we will be overcharging the taxpayers by $3 trillion. You would think that the suggestion to return to the taxpayers a mere 25 percent of these overpayments would not be controversial. But we have heard, over the past few months, the defenders of the status quo, the advocates of big government, raise their voices in criticism of our tax cut goal. \\n   These critics say that tax cuts are not needed, that taxpayers do not deserve to keep more of their hard earned money. It has even been suggested that the tax burden on our families has been falling. Well, the facts could not be any clearer: the federal government will tax away 20.6 percent of our nation's gross domestic product this year. That is an all-time, peacetime record, a level that was only exceeded when we mobilized to win World War II. \\n   But even though the tax burden is a record high, even though we will be overcharging the taxpayers by $3 trillion over the next decade, every excuse under the sun is being raised against tax cuts. Some of these arguments are contradictory, and all are wrong. \\n   Some argue, from a Keynesian demand-side perspective, that tax cuts will overstimulate the economy. But even after a $792 billion tax cut, the federal government will run up over $2 trillion in surpluses over the next ten years--from a Keynesian viewpoint, $2 trillion in surpluses is not considered a stimulus. And with all of the lags, the delays, and the phase-ins, the bulk of the tax cuts will not arrive until years 2007, 2008, and 2009. \\n   Can anyone seriously suggest that, in a $9 trillion economy, a $4 billion net tax cut for fiscal year 2000 will overstimulate consumer demand? Or even a $25 billion tax cut in 2001? Would a $39 billion tax cut in 2002 overheat the economy, when this is only .004 percent of projected GDP?  \\n   Clearly, the facts do not support the argument that our tax cuts will overheat the economy. In any event, from the demand-side perspective, the tax cut would be irrelevant. If we do not cut taxes by $792 billion, it is safe to say that spending will increase by $792 billion over the next decade--spending by the government, that is. That is what President Clinton means when he says we cannot afford a tax cut--his bureaucrats are working overtime to dream up new ways to spend the money, as if the government has first claims to the fruits of our citizens' labor. \\n   What kind of spending initiatives can we expect? A few years back, as many of us recall, President Clinton's so-called stimulus package included spending on such urgent needs as building parking garages at the beach, resurfacing tennis courts, researching the sicklefin chub fish, renovating swimming pools, building golf courses, soccer fields, and softball diamonds, and constructing an ice skating warming hut. \\n   Now, the President is not the only source of such wasteful spending ideas--we in Congress are very susceptible to pressures to spend, spend, spend. But no one here doubts for a minute that if the $792 billion in taxes are instead brought to Washington, the money will all be spent. That is one very good reason why we must keep the money out of Washington in the first place. \\n   The argument is also raised that a $792 billion tax cut leaves no money to meet some other important government goals such as debt reduction. But we still have $1.9 trillion in social security surpluses that will be in a ``lock-box'' to retire debt and shore up our citizens' retirement security, and another $505 billion in non-social security surpluses that can be used for Medicare, National Defense, and our other priorities. It is my hope that these surpluses will be used for real priorities, not the ice skating warming huts and beach parking garages. It should be clear that this half-trillion dollars is more than enough to cover our priorities. \\n   The rest of the arguments against our tax relief goal are similarly mistaken. Some people argue that the money is needed to retire publicly-held debt--although, after the tax cut, the remaining 75% of the surplus is available for debt reduction. Even with our tax cut, publicly-held national debt will be reduced from 40% of GDP to just 12% of GDP by 2009. \\n   Other people argue that the Federal Reserve Board would react to the tax cut by tightening the money supply. I have already noted that the very small size of the tax cuts over the next two years--just .0015% of GDP--does not add up to a dramatic increase in consumer demand and, in fact, will not increase demand since government spending would have increased by that same amount were we to collect the taxes. And I will point out that, on many occasion, including today, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has stated that he believes that government spending is the worst possible use of the surpluses, and that he would support tax cuts if spending is the alternative. Furthermore, a tax cut that removes government barriers to savings and investment is not an ``artificial stimulus'' that should worry the Fed one bit. Inflation, after all, is caused by too many dollars chasing too few goods, not by too many investors creating wealth and opportunity. An even stronger economy, fueled by the freedom and enthusiasm of our entrepreneurs, is not something to fear. \\n   It is even argued that a sizable tax cut passed now makes a future economic downturn more hazardous, as if the tax cuts needed for an economic rebound will have already been wasted by our efforts this year. Of course, that argument makes the case for tax cuts, as any tax cuts that would succeed in getting us out of a recession should keep us out of one in the first place. That is why former Fed Governor Lawrence Lindsey considers a tax cut a good insurance policy against an economic downturn. \\n   When you consider all of the arguments, there really is no case against cutting taxes by at least $792 billion. Chairman ROTH is to be commended for sticking to his guns and reporting out of Committee a bill that cuts taxes by that full amount, despite all of the pressure exerted by all of the advocates of big government, who would rather spend the money. \\n   One final point I want to make is that these abstract discussions tend to obscure the real reason we are here. Tax cuts are not about numbers, they aren't about aggregate statistics, they aren't about increasing demand by 4 thousandths of a percentage point--tax cuts are about people. We are cutting taxes because of the 67-year-old owner of a family business in Florida's panhandle, who is discouraged from reinvesting his hard-earned profits because the specter of the federal death tax is hovering, waiting to swoop down and scoop up 55% of the increased value of his business. We are cutting taxes because of the two-earner family, struggling to make ends meet, that has to pay over $1,000 extra in taxes just because they are married. \\n   We are cutting taxes so that waitresses, truck drivers, teachers and carpenters can put an extra $1,000 in their IRAs each year, to build a better nest egg for retirement. We are cutting taxes to enable a biomedical company to budget that one additional research project that just might lead to a breakthrough in the treatment of glaucoma or a cure for cancer. And we are cutting taxes to reduce government barriers to saving and investment, so the capital is available for the American entrepreneurs of the 21st Century to develop markets in technologies we cannot even imagine today. We need to cut taxes to get government out of the way and give people the freedom to pursue their own dream--not Washington's. \\n   I thank the Chair. \\n   I yield whatever time I did not use. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990722\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, on this occasion of the almost annual debate on NED, the National Endowment for Democracy, we can and we must declare our commitment to promoting freedom in the world. \\n   Freedom often exacts a price--it indeed is not free. Ronald Reagan understood this when he created NED, as have successive Presidents and Congresses who have consistently funded NED. \\n   Freedom is sacred. It is to be honored, protected, and shared with the world. It is the core of all human progress, and therefore, the spread of freedom enriches us all. \\n   But let us not forget, the price of freedom can be great. Just as we focus in this body these days on our abundance we must not forget those who have come before us; we must not forget in whose shoes we are walking. How many Americans have died; have put their lives on the line in the glorious pursuit of that sweetest of goals--emancipation from oppression and tyranny. We are the direct benefactors of the dedication, selflessness, and even the spilled blood, of countless people.  \\n   Should we be proud of those achievements? Of course, but we must also accept the weight--the responsibility--of this gift. The awesome responsibility which we have inherited. Because, when I said that freedom is not free, I was not only speaking of the cost to those currently suffering in the world to throw off the yoke of tyranny, but also the price to us, the benefactors of past actions. \\n   We are once again on the floor of the Senate to defend the National Endowment for Democracy. The last time we fought this battle, 2 years ago, 72 Senators voted to restore the funding to NED after the subcommittee zeroed the account. We are here today facing the same circumstances. The good news with the regularity of this debate, if we look for the bright side, is that we know very well of the strong support in the Senate for NED. And let me explain why. \\n   The history is important. In 1983, Ronald Reagan outlined an initiative for the United States to publicly lead the struggle for freedom around the world. A policy which I remember well as a young House Member and in many ways continues to influence my thinking about American foreign policy. A fundamental pillar of that policy was the National Endowment for Democracy. \\n   Let me read to you from a letter by President Reagan, from July 4, 1993.  \\n   On this 217th anniversary of our nation's independence, I am reminded that America's greatness lies not only in our success at home, but in the example of leadership that we provide the entire world. \\n   Our work, however, is not complete. As I look abroad, I see that the struggle between freedom and tyranny continues to be wages. Disappointly, in some places, it is autocracy, not freedom, that is winning the day. That is why I strongly support continued Congressional funding for the National Endowment for Democracy (NED). Ten years ago, at Westminster, you will recall that I outlined a new, bold initiative for our country to publicly lead the struggle for freedom abroad. As past of this effort, at my request, the National Endowment for Democracy was created.  \\n   Mr. President, let me point out a few fundamental things. First, NED is not a ``cold war relic,'' as some critics argue. You will note that President Reagan did not say that the purpose was to defeat communism, to defeat the Soviet Union, or to contain any particular ideology. He said that the mission of NED was to support America's efforts to ``lead the struggle for freedom.'' You should also note that the letter from which I read is dated July 4, 1993--2 years after the fall of the Soviet Union. So let me be clear: NED is not about the cold war and has never been exclusively about fighting communism or the Soviet Union. The National Endowment for Democracy is about freedom. \\n   My second point is that the need for NED is as great today as it has ever been. \\n   We opposed communism because the flawed ideology oppresses people and empowers tyrants. Communism has almost disappeared as a threat today; but tyranny has not--oppression has not. Indeed, tyranny and oppression continue to rule in far too many places around the globe. If you accept that we were right in the past to oppose freedom's foes, then we have the same task today, perhaps even more complicated than in the past. \\n   This vote, therefore, comes down to a simple issue: does the struggle for freedom continue in the world and does the United States continue to have a role in the struggle for freedom abroad? Does tyranny still reign in far too many places on earth? The answer is quite obviously, ``yes.'' \\n   Let me address some critical questions others have raised. \\n   Does NED work? NED works extremely well by providing resources to the freedom-activists throughout the world. NED identifies people struggling for economic, political, labor, press, and other reforms and gets them the resources necessary to fight against local oppression. \\n   His Holiness the Dalai Lama of Tibet says the following about NED:  \\n   The National Endowment for Democracy furthers the goals of your great nation and has provided moral and substantive support for oppressed peoples everywhere. Its unique independent mission has brought information and hope to people committed to peace and freedom, including the Tibetans. I sincerely hope that this institution will continue to receive support, because America's real strength comes not from its status as a `superpower' but from the ideals and principles on which it was founded.  \\n   So the final question which someone may rightly put to this debate: why not the State Department? Isn't NED redundant? \\n   To answer this question, I defer to some experts who understand the executive branch and State Department well. I turn to a bipartisan group of former Secretaries of State and National Security Advisors. \\n   In a 1995 letter, former National Security Advisors Allen, Carlucci, Brzezinski, and Scowcroft state that NED:  \\n   ..... operates in situations where direct government involvement is not appropriate. It is an exceptionally effective instrument in today's climate for reaching dedicated groups seeking to counter extreme nationalist and autocratic forces that are responsible for so much conflict and instability.  \\n   Let me emphasize that these National Security Advisors state that NED is operating where the U.S. government cannot. \\n   I also have a letter from former Secretaries of State, including Secretaries Baker, Muskie, Eagleburger, Shultz, Haig, Vance, and Kissinger. This distinguished group states the following:  \\n   During this period of international change and uncertainty, the work of NED continues to be an important bipartisan but non-governmental contributor to democratic reform and freedom. We consider the non-governmental character of the NED even more relevant today than it was at NED's founding.  \\n   Let me review the main arguments. First, NED's necessity did not end with the cold war, but remains an integral part of America's opposition to the enemies of freedom. Second, the world continues to need America's invaluable work in promoting freedom--perhaps even now more than ever. And finally, NED makes a unique contribution to America's initiative to ``lead the struggle for freedom abroad.'' \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990722\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to engage the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee in a colloquy. First let me begin by thanking my friends for ensuring the committee report included $2 million under the National Ocean Service account to support scientific research and coral reef studies. It is my understanding this money is to be divided equally between the National Coral Reef Institute in Ft. Lauderdale, FL, and the University of Hawaii. This research is critical to our understanding of the factors at work in the degradation of reef ecosystems around the world and I appreciate all my colleagues did in Committee to support this effort. \\n   I say to my colleagues, it is my understanding the Chairman's amendment contains additional funding for this account. Is it correct to say these funds are in addition to the $2 million currently provided by the Committee to the National Coral Reef Institute and the University of Hawaii? \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-19990722\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I thank my colleagues for this clarification and for their support of coral reef research. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-3-19990722\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee if he would consent to discuss with me for a moment two issues of concern to me with respect to NOAA activities in Florida. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-4-19990722\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. First, let me say I appreciate my friend from New Hampshire's hard work for the strong support he's given to the State of Florida in the bill before us today. But I would like to bring to the Chairman's attention an initiative undertaken by Florida's top three research universities: the University of Florida, Florida State University and the University of Miami. These three institutions came together to ensure their extensive capabilities in the areas of marine, atmosphere and climate prediction research were focused on the needs of the entire Southeast region. They have especially come together to study the El Nino phenomenon. Their effort has been recognized by NOAA and they have become one of the agency's first regional assessment centers. \\n   My concern, Mr. President, is about the possibility that NOAA may reduce resources available to Florida and this valuable research initiative. Clearly, Florida and the Southeast region are significantly impacted by climatic developments. A strong and continued investment in Florida and the region--along with a balanced investment in the regional assessment centers--is essential. I would ask the support of the Committee to continue the base level funding of this important collaborative  effort. The institutions had been receiving approximately $500,000 per year through the Office of Global Programs, and I would like the Chairman's assurances that this level of funding should and will be continued during the next fiscal year. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-5-19990722\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Yes. I know the chairman is aware of the Florida Congressional delegation's strong commitment to the restoration of the Everglades and Florida Bay. I have heard some concern, however, that internal reallocations within NOAA could result in at least a $1 million reduction in South Florida based Florida Bay activities. The administration asked for significant funding of the Everglades-Florida Bay initiative in both FY 99 and FY 2000 through the Coastal Ocean Science Program. But the concern I'm hearing from Florida indicates that NOAA may reallocate funds away from this initiative and toward other programs and purposes. I would like the Chairman to join me in stressing to the agency that funds in this bill currently allocated for critical Florida Bay initiatives not be depleted. I would like the Chairman to join me in working to ensure the NOAA contribution to the interagency program for Florida and adjacent coastal marine waters is continued at the current levels. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-6-19990722\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I appreciate my friend's comments with respect to these two issues. I thank him again for his continued support of Florida priorities. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-7-19990722\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I would like to engage the Chairman of the subcommittee in a brief colloquy regarding Barry University in Miami Shores, Florida. Barry University has a strong history of addressing important Miami community issues like urbanization, ethnic diversity, community development and cultural understanding. Recently the University announced the planning of an Intercultural Community Center which is designed to promote necessary neighborhood and small business revitalization. The facility will provide conference space, meeting rooms, executive seminars and continuing education courses related to international business and commerce. \\n   It is my understanding Barry University will be requesting an Economic Development Administration grant for this project from the Department of Commerce during the next fiscal year. I would appreciate the Chairman's support in recommending the Department of Commerce give strong consideration  to the merits of University's grant application. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-8-19990722\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I appreciate my friend from New Hampshire's comments on this important initiative and for all he and the Senator from South Carolina have done in this bill for the citizens of Florida. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990722\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President today I am pleased to join my colleague, Mr. BREAUX, in sponsoring The Medicare Home Health Beneficiary Equity and Payment Simplification Act of 1999. \\n   This legislation sets forth a fully developed prospective payment system for Medicare home health benefits that can be implemented easily using currently available data and can be accurately monitored to prevent fraud and abuse. Most importantly, the bill restores access to covered services for the sickest, most frail Medicare beneficiaries while providing incentives for efficient treatment of all patients regardless of the acuity of their medical condition. \\n   The bill provides for a simple four-category prospective payment system for home health services (similar to the four-category system which has been in place for hospice services since 1983) which is based on data from a 1997 study conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation on characteristics of Medicare patients in need of covered home health services. The Kaiser Foundation study found that Medicare patients in need of home health services historically have fallen into one of the following categories: \\n   1. Post-hospital, short stay beneficiaries \\n   2. Medically stable, long-stay beneficiaries \\n   3. Medically complex, long-stay beneficiaries \\n   4. Medically unstable and complex, extremely high use beneficiaries \\n   Beneficiaries who meet all eligibility and coverage requirements for Medicare will be assigned to the appropriate category by a physician who does not have a prohibited relationship with the home health agency as defined in the ``Stark II'' law. Beneficiaries who do not clearly fit in one of the four categories will be placed in the first, lowest rate category. \\n   Payment rates for each of the categories is the average cost of treating patients in that category in 1994 as determined by the Kaiser Foundation study. Those rates are adjusted for wage variations in different parts of the country and updated by the home health market basket for each fiscal year. The Secretary of HHS is given the authority to provide additional payments to certain agencies that have higher costs due to reasons beyond their control. \\n   The bill would eliminate the 15% cut in Medicare home health reimbursement which is scheduled to go into effect on October 1, 2000. The bill would also simplify the reimbursement system by making payments based on the location of the agency rather than the residence of the patient. The bill is inten ded to provide a ``fail safe'' prospective payment mechanism in the event that HCFA falls behind in its schedule to implement a prospective payment system by October 1, 2000 that can be administered efficiently and monitored effectively. \\n   I urge my colleagues to join us in co-sponsoring this important piece of legislation. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990720\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise to speak for just a moment to express my profound sympathy and condolences to our colleague and friend, Senator TED KENNEDY, and the members of the Kennedy family, and for the Bessette family, as well. \\n   Although I know the pain of losing a loved one, I have little conception of the pain which Senator KENNEDY and his family are feeling with the multiple losses of family members at such early stages in their lives, and under such tragic conditions. \\n   My heart is heavy with grief for the family, and my thoughts and prayers are with them. I can only pray that they realize and are comforted in some small manner by the love, affection, and support of the Members of this body, as well as people all across this nation, for whom the Kennedy family is a symbol of courage, achievement, and service to mankind. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990715\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Dr. Larry Kerr, a health fellow for the Judiciary Committee, be granted the privilege of the floor for the remainder of the debate on the Patients' Bill of Rights. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-19990715\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I thank the Chair. \\n   Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senator FRIST, Senator JEFFORDS, and Senator COLLINS, and others, as we offer this amendment to provide cancer patients with coverage of health insurance benefits when they participate in approved clinical trials. \\n   Many health plans will not pay for the cost of routine patient care if patients want to participate in a clinical trial. As a result, beneficiaries with cancer are denied access to these trials of promising new therapies because these therapies are deemed ``experimental'' by most health plans and, therefore, not qualified for coverage. This means many cancer patients have two choices when they have exhausted all traditional therapies: either pay the cost of participating in a clinical trial themselves or go without additional treatment. \\n   For all but the most wealthy patients, it is cost prohibitive to take part in a clinical trial. This amendment will help ensure that a patient's decision about whether or not to participate in a clinical trial is based upon science and not cost. \\n   Clinical trials are one of the most effective ways of determining which treatments are beneficial. Yet cancer researchers have told me they have had difficulty enrolling the required number of patients to participate in the clinical trials they are conducting. Scientists have identified noncoverage by private insurers, as well as Medicare, as one of the primary reasons why patients do not participate in clinical trials. \\n   For example, approximately 2 percent of cancer patients are participating in clinical trials. This amendment will help scientists recruit cancer patients who wish to participate in clinical trials by breaking down the financial barriers which may preclude most patients from participating. \\n   Clinical trials are one of the most effective techniques for assessing the effectiveness of a scientific and medical intervention. Many of my Senate colleagues have joined with me in a bipartisan effort to double biomedical research funding through the National Institutes of Health. Last year, Congress appropriated $15.6 billion for NIH. This represented a $2 billion increase, the largest increase in NIH history. At a time when American researchers are making such tremendous progress in scientific areas such as cancer genetics and biology, it is essential that this knowledge be translated into new therapies through well-designed clinical trials. This amendment is a natural extension of the historic effort to double funding for medical research in our country. \\n   When my brother, Michael, was diagnosed with cancer, there were only three basic forms of treatment--surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Today, scientists are revolutionizing the treatment of cancer by developing many new weapons to kill cancer, including gene therapy and immunotherapy. \\n   On a personal note again, every time I get into these discussions, and every time I see the new efforts that are being pursued, and the successes that have been developed, I cannot help but think if Michael's melanoma had been discovered or if he had found the disease much later in his life, when these new procedures--gene therapy and immunotherapy were available--and if he had been able to participate in a clinical trial, which he attempted to do throughout his treatment many years ago, his life may have been saved. \\n   This amendment will help scientists continue the unprecedented progress being made to find new methods of treatment. \\n   Coverage of cancer clinical trials is a bipartisan issue. Earlier this year, for example, Senator ROCKEFELLER and I introduced legislation to provide for Medicare coverage of cancer clinical trials. I am pleased to say that 36 additional Senators, from both sides of the aisle, have cosponsored this legislation. I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this important legislation during the 106th Congress. \\n   The reason Senator ROCKEFELLER and I targeted our legislation to cancer is the same reason we have targeted this amendment to cancer today--there is a legitimate debate about what the true cost may be. Senator ROCKEFELLER and I believe the cost will be insignificant. And we have the studies to prove that. \\n   However, there are legitimate concerns with respect to cost which have been raised. Both the amendment we offer today and the Rockefeller-Mack legislation, call for a study and report to Congress in 2005 on the cost implications of covering cancer clinical trials. \\n   I support comprehensive coverage of clinical trials. But, at this time, we need more information before we go further. This amendment will help provide the information we need to make a better informed decision. \\n   During markup of S. 326, the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions considered an amendment offered by my friend and colleague, Senator DODD, to provide clinical trial coverage. \\n   Since then, my colleagues and I have more thoroughly studied this amendment. We have examined what barriers exist that impede enrollment in clinical trials. We looked into the cost implications. We considered the best way to define the term ``routine patient costs.'' \\n   Let me first highlight the many similarities in our amendment and the amendment which Senator DODD offered during committee consideration. \\n   Our amendment requires plans to provide coverage of routine patient costs. I will get back to that term in a few minutes. \\n   Our amendments ensures that health plans are not required to pay for costs of items and services that are reasonably expected to be paid for by the sponsors of a clinical trial. This includes tests or measurements conducted primarily for the purpose of a clinical trial. \\n   Our amendment permits plans to require clinical trial participants to use in-network providers, if they are available. If coverage is provided by a nonparticipating provider, payment would be at the same rate the plan would pay for comparable services to a participating provider. \\n   Our amendment is limited to those health plans over which Congress has sole and exclusive jurisdiction. \\n   Our amendment is limited to only the highest-quality clinical trials. These include trials approved and funded by the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Veterans Affairs,  and the Department of Defense. Only those trials which have undergone the rigors of peer-review will be considered. \\n   Our legislation differs with Senator DODD's proposal in three ways. \\n   The first difference is how to best define the term ``routine patient cost.'' In researching this issue, we have found that there is not a generally accepted definition of the term, ``routine patient cost'' associated with participation in a clinical trial. The Balanced Budget Act required the Institute of Medicine to conduct a study on the issue of cancer clinical trial coverage, including the definition of routine patient costs. This study is due in September, and it will likely help us to better define this highly technical term. There are other experts who have opinions on how to define the term ``routine patient cost.'' We believe it is best to leave this task to patients, employers, health plans and those with true expertise in the field of clinical trials. \\n   It is essential to remember that protocols for clinical trials vary widely, and routine patient costs for clinical trials also vary. Scientific researchers have indicated that developing one standard for determining routine patient costs will be a daunting task. I don't believe Congress is best qualified to make this important scientific determination. \\n   Therefore, our amendment provides for a negotiated rulemaking process to establish a time-limited committee charged with developing standards relating to the coverage of routine patient costs for patients participating in clinical trials. This way, organizations representing cancer patients, health care practitioners, hospitals, employers, manufacturers of drugs and medical devices, medical economists and others will be involved in the process of defining routine patient costs with respect to clinical trials. \\n   By May, this committee is required to develop standards for routine patient costs for individuals who are participating in those trials. If the committee is unable to reach a consensus, then the Secretary must develop these standards and publish a rule by June 30, in the year 2000. In either case, coverage for these benefits would begin for plans beginning on, or after, January 1, 2001. \\n   We believe that a negotiated rulemaking process is the best way for organizations representing all who are affected to collectively determine what costs should be considered in ``routine patient costs.'' These decisions will have a major effect of the cost of covering clinical trials. \\n   I will just underscore that again. These decisions will have a major effect on the cost of covering clinical trials. \\n   Under the Democratic bill, these organizations can only submit a comment to the Secretary, who has broad authority to determine what constitutes routine patient costs. However, those comments could be rejected out-of-hand by the Secretary. \\n   By contrast, the negotiated rulemaking process ensures that all who have an interest in the outcome have a seat at the negotiating table to make the decision. We believe it is essential that cancer patients have an opportunity to be involved in establishing standards for routine patient costs, and a negotiated rulemaking procedure affords them that opportunity. \\n   Second, as I mentioned earlier, our amendment differs from the Dodd amendment in that it is limited to cancer clinical trials. There are more clinical trials involving cancer than perhaps any other disease. This targeted approach will not only provide a needed benefit to a large patient population, but it will also provide significant information for the study and report called for in this amendment. \\n   Finally, our amendment includes a study and report to Congress on the costs to health plans and any impact on health insurance premiums. Senator DODD's amendment did not include this study and report, which I believe is extremely important. Congress can then use this important information to determine if they wish to expand coverage for patients with other diseases. \\n   Like most of my colleagues, I am very concerned about the ever-increasing costs of health insurance. According to the Congressional Budget Office, our amendment will result in an increase in health insurance premiums of less than one-tenth of one percent. The Dodd proposal would cost five times that amount. \\n   I have met with thousands of cancer patients throughout Florida and the rest of the United States, patients desperately wanting to participate in clinical trials when traditional therapies are no longer beneficial. \\n   Let me conclude my comments here today by relating an experience which puts a human face on why this issue is so important. \\n   As my colleagues may know, I frequently visit the National Institutes of Health to meet with scientific reserchers so I may gain a better understanding of the many advances which are taking place to detect and treat cancer and other diseases. \\n   Over the years, I have been fortunate to get to know Dr. Steven Rosenberg, a world-renowned scientist and oncologist who is an expert in the field of melanoma research and treatment. I first met Dr. Rosenberg after reading his book, ``The Transformed Cell.'' \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-3-19990715\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I ask for 2 additional minutes. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-4-19990715\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Last year, I was meeting with Dr. Rosenberg to learn about a clinical trial he is conducting on a state-of-the art melanoma vaccine. During our conversation, Dr. Rosenberg mentioned that one of my constituents was at NCI participating in that clinical trial. I asked if I might meet him. Before we went to his hospital room at NCI, Dr. Rosenberg showed me photographs which had previously been taken. This patient had purple, bulbous melanoma lesions several inches in diameter down the side of his body. \\n   Dr. Rosenberg introduced me to my constituent, and we engaged in casual conversation. \\n   At one point I asked him how he was doing. To show me how he was doing, this brave man took off his hospital gown and showed me that these lesions of huge size on both his arm and his side were totally gone. That is why I think it is so important that we have this amendment included in the legislation, so that other cancer patients will have the same opportunity. \\n   To conclude, what is this amendment really about? Most importantly, it is about giving patients fighting cancer the hope that an experimental therapy being tested in a well-designed clinical trial might save their lives. In addition to providing hope, it paves the way for new therapies that will, one day, not only provide hope, but a cure. It is about allowing cancer patients to make what may be the final major health care decision of their lives--whether to participate in a clinical trial. \\n   Mr. President, I've met with many patients who were participating in clinical trials. To me, these patients are, in many ways, like America's astronauts. Later this month, we will celebrate the 30th anniversary of man's landing on the Moon. Like the astronauts of Apollo, clinical trial participants are pioneers. They are heroes, who are helping to push science and medicine into new frontiers. We must provide hope to these brave Americans. \\n   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-5-19990715\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I am not sure I need 5 minutes. I could not help but listen very closely to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle with respect to the issue of clinical trials and the idea of targeting clinical trials to cancer. \\n   One could draw the conclusion from what they had to say either they never heard of the idea of targeting clinical trials to cancer or there was some confusion. I remind my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who have supported a clinical trial expansion of the Medicare program that is limited to only cancer --let me say that again. The clinical trial legislation that Senator ROCKEFELLER and I introduced earlier this year is limited to cancer only; just as this amendment is limited to cancer: Senator FEINSTEIN, Senator SARBANES, Senator JOHNSON, Senator  BINGAMAN, Senator KERRY, Senator LEAHY, Senator KERREY, Senator SCHUMER, Senator AKAKA, Senator MURRAY, Senator BREAUX, Senator MIKULSKI, Senator CONRAD, Senator WELLSTONE, Senator MOYNIHAN, Senator INOUYE, Senator GRAHAM, Senator HARKIN, Senator KENNEDY, Senator BOXER, Senator DURBIN, Senator ROBB, Senator BIDEN, Senator DODD, and Senator HOLLINGS. \\n   I submit that one of the reasons we have this not only in this amendment but also in the Medicare approach is because there is truly a concern about what the true cost of clinical trials is. As I said in my earlier comment, Senator ROCKEFELLER and I happen to believe the cost is quite small. In fact, there are arguments out there that Medicare is already picking up the cost of those clinical trials. We have limited it to cancer because we, in fact, believe we can develop information that will allow us to expand it. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-6-19990715\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. If the Senator would wait. What I have found, as I have listened to this debate now for 4 days, is the term ``compartmentalization'' comes back into my mind: The ability on the other side of the aisle to think of one procedure, one amendment, one concept at a time, as if it has no influence or no effect on the cost of health care and what it might do to those individuals who could lose their health care coverage because of increased costs. It is very reasonable to ask the question: What does it cost; how do you define certain aspects of the clinical trial that is going to take place? \\n   I will be glad to yield. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-7-19990715\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Can I inquire who is going to use that minute? \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-8-19990715\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I believe the Senator from Florida has been graciously given 1 minute by Senator KENNEDY. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-9-19990715\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. First of all, the impression created that HMOs or most HMOs cover all clinical trials is inaccurate. \\n   There is a second component to this thing. ERISA plans versus the plans that we have control over may be confusing the issue as well. \\n   In addition, though, I think it is important to focus. Again, this discussion has come down to a discussion about cost. I happen to agree with the Senator from Connecticut about the data that we have from those two health organizations. But I think he knows as  well that there are those out there who make claims that the cost of the clinical trials would be substantially higher than that--from OMB, CBO, the administration. \\n   So the point is that there is a legitimate debate about the cost of clinical trials. I am saying I think, before we go to the full extent of comprehensive coverage, we ought to fully understand what we are getting ourselves involved in. \\n   With that, I yield the floor. \\n   Mr. DODD addressed the Chair. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990714\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank Senator FRIST for yielding me time. I also appreciate greatly the comments made with respect to the clinical trials. Again, I look forward to continuing to work with him in the future on this issue. \\n   Mr. President, I want to respond to one provision of the amendment offered last night by my friend from Connecticut, Senator DODD. This provision goes to a concern that has been raised by patients throughout our country--the issue of health coverage for patients who are participating in clinical trials. \\n   As Members of the United States Senate, we must seek legislative solutions to a wide array of public policy issues. These issues include health policy, as we are doing today. They include tax policy, economic policy, foreign policy, and education policy. The list is quite expansive. Frequently, we find ourselves divided on issues of the day. \\n   However, I can think of no issue which better unites Republicans and Democrats, conservatives and liberals, as the issue of biomedical research. \\n   In addition to Senator DODD, we are fortunate to have many, many leaders in the Senate on this important issue. Senator SPECTER and Senator HARKIN are leading the historic bipartisan effort to double funding for the National Institutes of Health. Senator JEFFORDS, Senator FIRST, Senator KENNEDY, and Senator MIKULSKI have worked hard in their committee to authorize and oversee the activities of the HIH. Any many more of my colleagues have each contributed in their own way to help make funding for HIH the national priority it is today. As I said, few issues unite the Senate like medical research. \\n   One of the highlights during my 17 years as a Member of the Senate and House of Representatives has been to meet the scientists who are revolutionizing the way man fights disease, and to improve our quality of life. It doesn't matter if they are a young bench scientist or a Nobel Laureate, their mission remains the same--to find ways to detect and treat diseases. Today, there is a level of commitment and enthusiasm to this monumental endeavor that I've never seen before. Today, researchers dare to use the word, ``cure.'' That wasn't the case very long ago. \\n   As we work to make sure that scientists have the necessary resources to continue their remarkable progress, we must also address the ethical, legal and social implications of biomedical research. Science is moving faster than public policy can keep pace. It's as though science is on the Concorde, and Congress stalled at Kitty Hawk trying to get off the ground. \\n   There are very difficult, complex scientific issues which require Congressional action, but these issues also require thoughtful and careful deliberation. For example, Congress has been working for many years to ensure that health plans do not discriminate against people because of their genetic information. As a cancer survivor, I know how important it is to have confidence in knowing that a genetic test will be used for information, not discrimination. I've been part of a bipartisan effort to resolve this issue, starting with legislation introduced by our former colleague, Senator Mark Hatfield. \\n   Genetic nondiscrimination is a very complex issue with wide-ranging ramifications. There have been many questions to answer. Congress has struggled with how best to define medical and scientific terms. We have examined the impact of our actions on the cost and availability of health insurance. Frequently, we have determined that much more information was needed before deciding the best approach. \\n   We have addressed the issue of genetic nondiscrimination with thoughtful deliberation, and I believe the Congress must take the same thoughtful, deliberative approach when it comes to coverage of clinical trials. \\n   There are many questions to be answered. What are the cost implications? How will this new benefit impact the availability of health insurance? What impact will coverage of clinical trials have on health insurance premiums? How will it impact small business owners, who are struggling to provide health insurance for their employees? What is the best approach to defining medical and scientific terms, such as ``routine patient costs''?--becasue that definition will determine what the underlying costs of this effort will be. \\n   These are very important questions, involving very complex issues, with very significant implications. \\n   Mr. President, I support comprehensive coverage of clinical trials. But, as this time, we need more information before we go that far. \\n   Later today, or tomorrow, I will be introducing an amendment, along with Senator FRIST, Senator JEFFORDS, Senator COLLINS, and others, which will help provide patients, scientists, lawmakers, employers, health plans and others with answers to the many questions associated with health insurance coverage for clinical trials. I will outline our approach at that time. \\n   Mr. President, medical research is a bipartisan issue. We all agree that the basic scientific research funded by the National Institutes of Health must be translated into new forms of treatment through well-designed clinical trials. Earlier this year, Senator ROCKFELLER and I introduced legislation to provide Medicare coverage for cancer clinical trials. I am pleased to say that a bipartisan group of 36 Senators have cosponsored this bill. Senator SNOWE and others have introduced legislation to provide coverage through private health plans. We may approach the issue in different ways, but we all agree that the Senate must address the issue of clinical trial coverage, and we must do so now.  \\n   Mr. President, I look forward to discussing my amendment later in the debate. \\n   I yield the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990630\\n\\n    Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I oppose this travel amendment in the strongest possible terms. This is the wrong language at the wrong time. It represents a fundamental change in our Cuba policy--a change without proper consideration. \\n   The Foreign Relations Committee has not considered this language; in fact, nobody has seen this language until it was introduced this afternoon. We should not rush this language through. \\n   We should not do this. This is a half-baked approach, which makes for weak policy; it is not a mature effort to craft serious policy. \\n   Fidel responds to our positive gestures with arrests, oppression, and crackdown. This effort is misguided and must be tabled. \\n   Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990622\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able to address the Senate as if in morning business for up to 15 minutes. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-19990622\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I thank the Chair. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990622\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, proponents of the quota legislation to be considered later today have spoken with vigor and passion regarding the ``injury'' that was suffered by domestic steel companies and the threat imports pose to the workers at those companies.  \\n   However, I am compelled to rise today to respond to many of the assertions raised regarding the steel industry specifically, and more generally I think it is important to speak to several other factors related to the bill. First, there are economic benefits all Americans enjoy as a result of lowering trade barriers; second, the harmful message a quota bill would send to our trading partners; and, third, the inappropriateness of Congress singling out a specific industry for special treatment. \\n   The first point I would like to make is that the import surge is over. According to the Department of Commerce, imports have returned to their traditional levels. In fact, overall steel imports in the first 4 months of 1999 were below the ``pre-import'' surge level. Moreover, even with the import surge of 1998, U.S. steel producers reported profits of over $1 billion. \\n   Furthermore, in reviewing data provided by the Steel Manufacturers Association, I was surprised to find that U.S. steel production has increased over the last 10 years. The 1998 steel output of 107.6 million tons was 10 percent greater than 1990 and the highest for any year since 1981. \\n   Additionally, I was interested to discover that since 1987, imports as a percentage of domestic consumption have remained constant at around 20 percent. Again, according to this data, no ground has been lost despite protestations to the contrary. \\n   Some have argued that the financial ill health of several specific companies such as Bethlehem Steel Corporation, Weirton Steel Corporation, Laclede Steel Company, Acme Metals Incorporated, and Geneva Steel Company are the direct result of last year's import surge. However, the fact is that many of the integrated steel mills have a history of declining financial health evident well in advance of the Asian crisis and the 1998 import surge. This is reflected in their stock performance which, without exception, shows a pronounced decline in the value of the stock over the last 5 years. Again, it has nothing to do with the surge in imports. \\n   Noting the declining employment figures in the steel industry, proponents of the quota bill suggest that the United States is losing market share, but the fact is imports have not led to a decrease in market share. U.S. steel production in traditional integrated mills has remained fairly flat. Import competition has merely forced U.S. steel to become more efficient. The growth in domestic production that has allowed U.S. steel to retain its domestic share has been almost exclusively a result of our Nation's mini-mills which now account for almost 50 percent of domestic steel production. Mini-mills use an innovative production technique to recycle scrapped steel. These highly efficient and environmentally friendly producers are transforming the steel industry, and I think here it is worth noting that the association of mini-mills is neutral with regard to the proposed quota legislation. \\n   Finally in this area, some argue our foreign competitors are playing by a different set of rules. \\n   This is exactly what our current antidumping laws are intended to address. The steel industry has shown itself to be intimately familiar with and more than willing to take advantage of these laws. Even though steel accounts for only 5 percent of our imports, the industry has generated 46 percent of the unfair-trade complaints brought before the U.S. International Trade Commission during the last 2 decades. Our current laws provide appropriate protection for all industries. They should not be circumvented in order to provide extraordinary protection for a single industry. \\n   All too often we hear complaints of lost jobs and invariably the blame is laid on trade. This allegation has gone unanswered for far too long. Trade has given us far more jobs than would otherwise be available. The fact is that the size of the trade sector has grown steadily during the last 50 years. As a share of the economy, trade doubled between 1950 and 1980, and it has doubled again between 1980 and 1998. Not surprisingly, employment has expanded from 99 million in 1980 to 133 million today. And, the unemployment rate has fallen to 4.2 percent, the lowest level in 30 years. \\n   Far from harming our economy, trade has been a major contributing factor to our growth and our prosperity. Real GDP is now 64 percent greater than it was in 1980 and we have experienced only 9 months of recession during the last 16 years. Moreover, our growth rate is now the highest and our unemployment rate the lowest among the G-7 nations. \\n   Trade makes it possible for us to focus on the production of the things we do best, and thereby produce a larger output and enjoy a higher standard of living. For goods and services that we produce cheaply, we can expand our output and sell abroad at attractive prices. And for things we do poorly, we can acquire them more economically from foreign producers. Thus, trade promotes prosperity. \\n   We have fought for open markets both through GATT and now the WTO. And we have been engaged in this fight, this battle for almost 50 years. For some time, we have told the world that economic freedom and a market economy are key ingredients of prosperity. The steel quota bill undermines this message. \\n   Let me make four points with respect to the message. \\n   A quota bill would send the wrong message to the European Union. A quota bill would send the wrong message to the former Communist countries seeking to establish market economies. A quota bill would send the wrong message to investors. And a quota bill would send the wrong message to our trading partners. \\n   Let me just touch lightly on each of those. \\n   With respect to the European Union, \\n   we are currently in the midst of a trade dispute with the EU regarding their restrictions on both bananas and beef. The steel quota bill undercuts our position on these issues. How can we complain about the restrictions of others while we ourselves are erecting trade barriers? \\n   With respect to the leaders of the former communist countries, this bill says when we think it is convenient, it is all right to substitute political manipulation for markets. I can assure you, the leaders of the former communist countries are watching. If a prosperous America with a low unemployment rate is willing to bail out troubled firms, how can we expect them to refrain from such action. \\n   With respect to investors, while much of the world has been in recession, investment flowed into the United States and the U.S. economy remained strong. In no small degree, this confidence of investors was due to the openness of our economy and our reliance on markets rather than politics. \\n   Again, with respect to our trading partners, our trading partners--most of which have lower and slower rates of growth and higher unemployment--are unlikely to stand idly by while we impose trade barriers. Retaliation and escalation of trade barriers are likely side-effects. \\n   Finally, it bears mentioning that it is a serious mistake for Congress to play favorites. This is precisely what is involved here. \\n   This bill imposes a tax on steel-users in order to subsidize steel-producers. A substantial share of the U.S. steel industry refines raw steel into finished and specialty goods. The U.S. steel industry is therefore a major purchaser of imported steel. Higher steel prices which will surely accompany import quotas will increase the cost of refined steel and make these products less competitive than would otherwise be the case. \\n   Moreover, this bill would treat the steel industry different than other industries. Steel is not the only industry that has been adversely affected by currency devaluations and weak demand due to the Asian crisis and recession in several parts of the world. The sales of many firms were affected as the result of these factors. Why should this industry be singled out for special treatment? \\n   In conclusion, I want to stress that the legislation we will be considering later today proposes that the Congress intervene in the market, risk a trade war, and endanger the future health of our economy in order to insulate a segment of out steel industry from competition. I maintain there is already sufficient legislation on the books to protect industries against unfair competitive practices. Quotas and trade barriers are the wrong path. The world has already gone down this ``trade  war'' road once before with the Smoot-Hawley Law of 1930. Let's not make that same mistake again. \\n   Additionally, I should note that Chairman Greenspan recently has sounded the dangers of protectionism. He now believes that rising protectionism is the single most dangerous threat to our future growth and prosperity. I share his concern. \\n   Make no mistake about it--important principles are at stake here. We should be reducing trade barriers rather than increasing them. We have no business playing favorites. As our recent High-Tech Summit indicated, trade in both goods and ideas has made an enormous contribution to our prosperity. We must not allow this misguided effort to assist some at the expense of others and endanger American prosperity. \\n   With that, I yield the floor, Mr. President. \\n   Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990616\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of the Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999. This bill was introduced by Senator JEFFORDS and co-sponsored by 77 members. The primary purpose of this legislation is to expand the availability of health care coverage under the Social Security Act for working individuals with disabilities. This bill establishes a Ticket to Work and Self-Sufficiency Program in the Social Security Administration to make available meaningful work opportunities for the disabled. \\n   Some months ago, in Florida, I met a woman who does not have the use of her arms. This woman is an accomplished artist who uses her feet to create beautiful works of art. She spoke with me about the difficulty she has had over the years obtaining health insurance for routine medical care and asked me to support this bill. It is with her in mind and the many other talented, hard-working disabled Americans that I support this act which will make it possible for them to obtain health coverage and lead productive working lives. \\n   This bill allows states to offer Medicaid coverage to workers with disabilities beyond what is currently available to them under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. It creates two new optional eligibility categories and allows states to offer buy-ins for the working disabled so that they can maintain health care coverage, work, and have as much independence as their disability allows. One option permits states to offer a Medicaid buy-in to people with disabilities who work and have an earned income above 250% of poverty with specified levels for assets, resources and unearned income set by the state in which they reside. This is important to many of the disabled who have income or assets that exceed the current level and have an earned income that has exceeded $500 per month during the past year. The state can and should impose a sliding scale of cost-sharing of the premium, up to 100% of the premium, based on the income of the individual. This will allow many of the disabled who simply cannot get health insurance because they have income or assets above a certain level, to obtain health coverage. With the passage of this legislation, a person with disabilities who may be an artist, computer programmer or run a telephone answering service can now be successful at work and have no fear of being unable to obtain health coverage. \\n   The second option allows states that elect to participate in the first option to also cover people who have a severe impairment but can lose eligibility for Supplemental Security Income or Social Security Disability Insurance because of medical improvement. In certain cases, the only reason a person improves is because they receive medical treatment. This bill prevents a person from losing their health care coverage when their health improves due to medical treatment. The state can allow this type of person to buy into the state Medicaid program at a premium set by the state. This is a blessing to persons with disabling conditions which are amenable to treatment such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, depression, or sickle cell anemia. It allows people who can work to work and receive treatment for what may be a chronic disease and have no fear of losing their health coverage. \\n   An additional benefit of this bill provides for the continuation of Medicare coverage for working individuals with disabilities. An extended period of eligibility will allow people who receive Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) to continue to receive Part A Medicare coverage without payment for up to six years after returning to work. At present, disabled people may receive Medicare coverage for nine months followed by 36 months of extended eligibility but after that, they have to pay the Part A premium in full. Often, people returning to work following a period of coverage by SSDI, work part time so they are ineligible for health insurance or they cannot obtain insurance through their employer or from the private market. This bill would permit them to receive Part A coverage and have coverage they could not otherwise obtain. \\n   I join with my colleagues in support of this legislation to help the disabled help themselves. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990616\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I want to engage the distinguished Senator from new Mexico and the distinguished Senator from Nevada, managers of the pending bill, in a colloquy. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-19990616\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I thank the Senator. \\n   Florida International University in my State of Florida has done a truly remarkable job of working with the Department of Energy in carrying out critically important environmental research and development of deactivation and decommissioning environmental technologies. More specifically, FIU's Hemispheric Center for Environmental Technology (HCET) has a proud history of partnering with DOE through its Environmental Management program to form a true `center of excellence' in these areas and the President's fiscal year 2000 budget request for the EM program assumes full funding for continuation of this impressive partnership. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-3-19990616\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I yield to my colleague from Florida. \\n   Senator GRAHAM. I echo the comments of the Senator from Florida about the FIU Hemispheric Center for Environmental Technology and reinforce the importance of the FIU Center in assisting the Department of Energy in deactivation and decommissioning of some of the most strategically important DOE sites in the Nation, including Fernald, Chicago, Albuquerque, Richland, and Oak Ridge facilities. I am proud of the role that HCET plays in these efforts. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-4-19990616\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I thank my colleague from Florida. It is my understanding that the President's budget contains sufficient funding ($5,000,000) to fully fund the current working agreement between Florida International University and the Department of Energy. Is that the Chairman's understanding? \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-5-19990616\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I thank the Chairman. I specifically request that, as the distinguished senior Senator from New Mexico and the chairman of the Energy and Water Development Subcommittee continues to shepherd this legislation through the Senate and conference with the House, he would make every possible effort to provide the full budget request for the DOE's Environmental Management program and protect the full funding contained therein for the DOE-Florida International University partnership. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-6-19990616\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I thank the distinguished Senators from New Mexico and Nevada for their commitment and leadership on this important legislation. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990616\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to remedy a problem in the way the U.S. taxes the foreign operations of U.S. electric and gas utilities. With the 1992 passage of the National Energy Policy Act, Congress gave a green light to U.S. utilities wishing to do business abroad, lifting a long-standing prohibition. U.S. utilities were allowed to compete for the foreign business opportunities created by the privatization of national utilities and the need for the construction of facilities to meet increased energy demands abroad. \\n   Since 1992, U.S. utility companies have made significant investments in utility operations in the United Kingdom, Australia, Eastern Europe, the Far East and South America. These investments in foreign utilities have created domestic jobs in the fields of design, architecture, engineering, construction, and heavy equipment manufacturing. They also allow U.S. utilities an opportunity to diversify and grow. \\n   Unfortunately, the Internal Revenue Code penalizes these investments by subjecting them to double-taxation. U.S. companies with foreign operations receive tax credits for a portion of the taxes they pay to foreign countries, to reduce the double-taxation that would otherwise result from the U.S. policy of taxing worldwide income. The size of these foreign tax credits are affected by a number of factors, as U.S. tax laws recalculate the amount of foreign income that is recognized for tax credit purposes. \\n   Section 864 of the tax code allocates deductible interest expenses between the U.S. and foreign operations based on the relative book values of assets located in the U.S. and abroad. By ignoring business realities and the peculiar circumstances of U.S. utilities, this allocation rule overtaxes them. Because U.S. utilities were until recently prevented from operating abroad, their foreign plants and equipment have been recently-acquired and consequently have not been much depreciated, in contrast to their domestic assets which are in most cases fully-depreciated. Thus, a disproportionate amount of interest expenses are allocated to foreign income, reducing the foreign income base that is recognized for U.S. tax purposes thus the size of the corresponding foreign tax credits. \\n   The allocation rules increase the double-taxation of foreign income by reducing foreign tax credits, thereby increasing domestic taxation. The unfairness of this result is magnified by the fact that the interest expenses--which are the reason the foreign tax credit shrinks--are usually associated with domestically-regulated debt, which is tied to domestic production and is not as fungible as the tax code assumes. \\n   The result of this economically-irrational taxation scheme is a very high effective tax rate on certain foreign investment and a loss of U.S. foreign tax credits. Rather than face this double-tax penalty, some U.S. utilities have actually chosen not to invest overseas and others have pulled back from their initial investments. \\n   One solution to this problem is found in the legislation that I am introducing today. This remedy is to exempt from the interest allocation rules of Section 864 the debt associated with a U.S. utility's furnishing and sale of electricity or natural gas in the United States. This proposed rule is similar to the rule governing ``non-recourse'' debt, which is not subjected to foreign allocation. In both cases, lenders look to specific cash flows for repayment and specific assets as collateral. These loans are thus distinguishable from the typical risks of general credit lending transactions. \\n   The specific cash flow aspect of non-recourse financing is a critical element of the non-recourse debt exception, and logic requires that the same tax treatment should be given to analogous utility debt. Thus, my bill would exempt from allocation to foreign source income the interest on debt incurred in the trade or business of furnishing or selling electricity or natural gas in the United States. The current situation is a very real problem that must be remedied, and I urge my colleagues to support the solution I am proposing. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990527\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today in support of additional funds to be made available for Air Force Research, Development, Test and Evaluation in the Fiscal Year 2000 Department of Defense Authorization measure to be used to complete development of a state-of-the-art 3 dimensional optical imaging and tracking instrumentation data system. \\n   The 3 Data System is a laser radar system that provides high fidelity time, space, positioning information (TSPI) on test articles during flight. The instrumentation can be applied to air, ground, and sea targets. Additionally, it will provide the potential capability for over-the-horizon tracking from an airborne platform or pedestal mounted ground platform. It includes a multi-object tracking capability that will allow simultaneous tracking of up to 20 targets throughout their profile. The system will enable testing of advanced smart weapon systems; force-on-force exercises where multiple aircraft and ground vehicle tracking is involved; over water scoring of large footprint autonomous guided and unguided munitions; and enable an improvement to existing aging radar presently in service. It is mobile and can support testing at other major ranges and locations in support of other Service's requirements. \\n   The Air Force has identified the 3-Data System as having high military value as it will enable the effective evaluation of the performance of advanced weapon systems to be utilized in future conflicts. The Air Force has informed me that precision engagement is one of the emerging operational concepts in Joint Vision 2010. The 3-Data system would provide a capability to effectively evaluate the performance of advanced precision guided munitions and smart weapons prior to their use in a wartime environment. It would also directly support ongoing activities abroad through Quick Reaction Tasking that may require a multiple object tracking device to evaluate engagement profiles. This requirement is documented through 46th Test Wing strategic planning initiatives, developmental program test plans, and munitions strategic planning roadmaps.  \\n   The Air Force is presently attempting to meet this requirement through existing radar systems and optical tracking systems which cannot track multiple objects to the fidelity levels required and which require extensive post-mission data reduction times. This system will provide the capability to effectively track multiple targets simultaneously. \\n   Mr. President, I thank the Committee for their willingness to support this amendment. The 3-Data System will play a important role in enabling the Air Force to evaluate the capabilities and limitations of multiple smart weapons and their delivery systems during their develpoment. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990527\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Defense Jobs and Trade Promotion Act of 1999. This bill, cosponsored by Senator Feinstein and 16 of our colleagues, will eliminate a provision of tax law which discriminates against United States exporters of defense products. \\n   Other nations have systems of taxation which rely less on corporate income taxes and more on value-added taxes. By rebating the value-added taxes for products that are exported, these nations lower the costs of their exports and provide their companies a competitive advantage that is not based on quality, ingenuity, or resources but rather on tax policy. \\n   In an attempt to level the playing field, our tax code allows U.S. companies to establish Foreign Sales Corporations (FSCs) through which U.S.-manufactured products may be exported. A portion of the profits from FSC sales are exempted from corporate income taxes, to mitigate the advantage that other countries give their exporters through value-added tax rebates. \\n   But the tax benefits of a FSC are cut in half for defense exporters. This 50% limitation is the result of a compromise enacted 23 years ago as part of  the predecessor to the FSC provisions. This compromise was not based on policy considerations, but instead merely split the difference between members who believed that the U.S. defense industry was so dominant in world markets that the foreign tax advantages were inconsequential, and members who believed that all U.S. exporters should be treated equally. \\n   Today, U.S. defense manufacturers face intense competition from foreign businesses. With the sharp decline in the defense budget over the past decade, exports of defense products play a prominent role in maintaining a viable U.S. defense industrial base. It makes no sense to allow differences in international tax systems to stand as an obstacle to exports of U.S. defense products. We must level the international playing field for U.S. defense product manufacturers. \\n   The fifty percent exclusion for sales of defense products makes even less sense when one considers that the sale of every defense product to a foreign government requires the determination of both the President and the Congress that the sale will strengthen the security of the United States and promote world peace. This is more than a matter of fair treatment for all U.S. exporters. National security is enhanced when our allies use U.S.-manufactured military equipment, because of its compatibility with equipment used by our armed forces. \\n   The Department of Defense supports repeal of this provision. In an August 26, 1998 letter, Deputy Secretary of Defense John Hamre wrote Treasury Secretary Rubin about the FSC. Hamre wrote, ``The Department of Defense (DoD) supports extending the full benefits of the FSC exemption to defense exporters.*.*.*.[P]utting defense and non-defense companies on the same footing would encourage defense exports that would promote standardization and interoperability of equipment among our allies. It also could result in a decrease in the cost of defense products to the Department of Defense.'' \\n   The bill we are introducing today supports the DoD recommendation. It repeals the provision of the Foreign Sales Corporation laws that discriminates against U.S. defense product manufacturers, enhancing both the competitiveness of U.S. companies in world markets and our national security. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990526\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today Senator GRAHAM and I introduce legislation that would help protect Florida from economic devastation in the event of a catastrophic windstorm or other peril. \\n   Our legislation would amend Section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code to grant tax-exempt status to the Florida Windstorm Underwriting Association (FWUA), the Florida Residential Property and Casualty Joint Underwriting Association (JUA) and similar state-chartered, not-for-profit insurers serving markets in which commercial insurance is not available. The FWUA and JUA are non-profit entities established by the state to provide property and casualty insurance coverage in those markets not adequately served by other insurers. \\n   In most years, Florida is not hit by a major hurricane or natural catastrophe. In those years, the FWUA and JUA take in more premiums than are paid out in claims or expenses. Since these entities are not-for-profit, state law prevents those funds from being distributed--they are instead literally saved for a severely rainy or windy day. Nonetheless, the Internal Revenue Code requires 35% of those funds to be sent to Washington as federal income taxes rather than used to fund reserves. Designating the FWUA and JUA as tax-exempt will help Florida to accumulate the necessary reserves to pay claims brought on by a catastrophe. This bill gives the two Florida catastrophe funds the same tax-exempt status that is already enjoyed by a number of not-for-profit insurance provers. \\n   State law authorizes the FWUA and the JUA to assess property insurance policyholders throughout Florida to pay for losses generated by catastrophic storms or other perils. Thus, the benefits of the tax exemption would reduce the frequency and severity of assessments levied against individual policyholders. Greater funds would be available to cover losses which otherwise would be paid for by higher assessments on Florida policyholders--cutting taxes for the approximately 5,000,000 property owners in the state of Florida. \\n   This legislation has the bipartisan support of the entire Florida Congressional delegation in addition to strong backing from Governor Jeb Bush, the State Insurance Commissioner, the Florida Senate President and Florida's House Speaker. And this change in the tax code would result in only a negligible loss of federal tax revenue, according to Joint Tax. \\n   Our legislation is extremely important to homeowners and businesses throughout the state of Florida, all of whom are subject to assessment if reserves are not sufficient to pay claims in the event of a severe hurricane or other catastrophe. With hundreds of miles of magnificent coastline, Florida remains sensitive to the perils of nature. Enactment of our legislation permits Florida to prepare for the next Hurricane Andrew while alleviating some of the economic hardship exacted on Florida property owners. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990519\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, two years ago in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, we included a provision to correct an unfair and unsound tax policy of the Clinton Administration concerning business meal deductions. The 1993 Clinton tax increases included a reduction in the percentage of business meal expenses that could be deducted, from 80 percent down to 50 percent. The Administration marketed this as an attack on the ``three martini lunch,'' but the tax increase was in fact a big blow to the wallets and pocketbooks of working class Americans whose jobs require them to be stranded far from home. \\n   Workers who are covered by federal ``hours of service'' regulations--long-haul truckers, airline flight attendants and pilots, long distance bus drivers, some merchant mariners and railroad workers--have no choice but to eat their meals on the road. Their meal expenses are a necessary and unavoidable part of their jobs. The Clinton Administration's business meal tax increase hit these occupations hard. For the average trucker, making between $32,000 and $36,000 annually, this tax increase might be greater than $1,000 per year. This is a lot of money to these hard-working taxpayers. \\n   Congress addressed this inequity in 1997, passing a provision that would gradually raise the meal deduction percentage back to 80 percent for these workers. But a slow, gradual fix is not good enough. Today, Senator KOHL, Senator GRASSLEY, and I are introducing a bill that would immediately restore the 80 percent deduction for truckers, flight crews, and other workers limited by the federal ``hours of service'' regulations. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990514\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today Senator BOB GRAHAM and I, along with 17 of our colleagues, are introducing legislation to modernize the tax rules that apply to real estate investment trusts (``REITs''). \\n   This legislation is designed to remove barriers in the tax laws that impose unnecessary administrative burdens and make it more difficult for REITs to compete in an evolving marketplace. Our bill is similar to a proposal included in the President's Fiscal Year 2000 budget that permits REITs to establish a new type of subsidiary called a ``taxable REIT subsidiary'' (``TRS''). As with the President's proposal, the legislation we introduce today would permit REITs to establish a TRS to provide non-customary services to their tenants and to provide services to third parties. In return for these new rules, the TRS would be subject to a number of rules designed to prevent any income from being shifted out of the taxable subsidiary to the REIT. \\n   Congress created REITs in 1960 to enable small investors to invest in real estate. The REIT provisions were modeled after the rules that applied to mutual funds. If a number of requirements are met, a corporation electing to be a REIT may deduct all dividends paid to its shareholders. One of the major requirements for REIT status is that REITs must distribute virtually all of their taxable income to their shareholders. Thus, unlike other C corporations that tend to retain most of their earnings, the income tax burden for REITs is shifted to the shareholder level. Unlike partnerships, REITs cannot pass losses through to their investors. \\n   REITs are subject to a number of rules to ensure their primary focus is real estate activities. For example, at least 75% of a REIT's assets must be comprised of rental real estate, mortgages, cash items and government securities. A REIT also must satisfy two income tests. First, at least 75% of a REIT's annual gross income must consist of real property rents, mortgage interest, gain from the sale of a real estate asset and certain other real estate-related sources. Second, at least 95% of a REIT's annual gross income must be derived from the income items from the above 75% test plus other ``passive income'' sources such as dividends and any type of interest. In addition, a REIT cannot own more than 10% of the voting securities of a non-REIT corporation, and the securities of a single non-REIT corporation cannot be worth more than 5% of the REIT's assets. \\n   Although REITs were created in 1960, they did not really become a significant part of the real estate marketplace until the 1990s--partly because the original legislation did not permit REITs to manage their own property. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 changed this, by permitting REITs to manage their own properties through the provision of ``customary services'' to tenants. \\n   The market capitalization of REITs grew from about $13 billion at the end of 1991 to over $140 billion today. The taxes generated from REITs similarly have increased, with dividends from public REITs increasing from about $1 billion in 1991 to more than $8 billion today. While REITs remain a small portion of the entire real estate sector--in the range of 10% nationally--they account for as much as half of some sectors that require immense amounts of capital, such as shopping centers. While the REIT industry has come a long way in recent years, it continues to fulfill its original mission: permitting small investors access to attractive real estate investments. Almost 90% of REIT shareholders are individuals either investing directly or through mutual funds. \\n   Although REITs have seen remarkable growth in the 1990s, their ability to meet new competitive pressures in the real estate sector is in question as a result of tax law limitations on their activities. These rules limit the ability of REITs to provide full services to their tenants and to third parties. In general, REITs may only provide services to their tenants which the IRS has determined to be ``customary'' in the business, meaning services already provided by the typical real estate company in the market. REITs may only provide real estate-related services to third parties through preferred stock subsidiaries which they can own but not control. REITs are thus prohibited from offering leading edge, full service options to their tenants and limited in the use of their expertise to serve third parties. This presents competitive problems for REITs as the real estate marketplace has evolved and property owners have sought to provide a range of services to their tenants and other customers. \\n   As a result, REITs increasingly have been unable to compete with privately-held partnerships and other more exclusive forms of ownership. Today, the rules prevent REITs from offering the same types of customer services as their competitors, even as such services are becoming more central to marketing efforts. Examples abound: (1) offering concierge services to office and apartment tenants to pick up tickets or dry cleaning, to walk pets, etc.; (2) offering a branded credit card at shopping malls, with rebates to be used as store credits at stores in the mall; (3) high speed Internet hook-ups, including enhanced telecommunications services (e.g., creating and maintaining a website) offered by a landlord's partner; (4) partnering with an office supply provider to offer reduced prices on office supplies; and (5) pick-up and delivery services at self-storage rentals. \\n   Without greater flexibility to provide competitive services to tenants and other customers, REITs will become less and less competitive with others in the real estate marketplace. REITs will have to wait for services to be deemed ``customary.'' As a practical matter, that means a REIT must wait until the IRS concludes that almost everybody else has been providing the service. If a REIT is forced to lag the market, it can be neither competitive nor provide its investors with a satisfactory return on their investment. Certainly, this is not consistent with what Congress intended when it created REITs, and when it modified the REIT rules over the years. In keeping with the Congressional mandate to provide a sensible and effective way for the average investor to benefit from ownership of income-producing real estate, REITs should be able to provide a range of services through taxable subsidiaries. \\n   The Administration's proposed Fiscal Year 2000 Budget acknowledges this problem. The Administration proposes modernizing REIT rules to permit REITs, on a limited basis, to use taxable subsidiaries to provide the services necessary to compete in the evolving real estate marketplace. The Administration proposal is a good start, but I believe additional refinements would further promote competitiveness. The legislation that we are introducing today builds upon the Administration proposal. Our bill addresses the  appropriate needs of the REIT industry and its investors in a manner consistent with the underlying rationale for REITs and the requirements of the highly competitive, evolving real estate marketplace. \\n   This legislation would give greater flexibility to REITs by permitting them to establish ``taxable REIT subsidiaries'' (``TRSs'') that could provide non-customary services to tenants and services to third parties. The 5% and 10% asset tests would not apply to the TRS. REITs would continue to be subject to the 75% asset tests so the value of their TRS, together with the value of other non-real estate assets, could not exceed 25% of the total value of a REIT's assets. In addition, the REIT would have to continue to satisfy the 95% and 75% income tests, with dividends or interest from a TRS to a REIT counting towards the 95% test, but not the 75% test. Accordingly, at least 75% of a REIT's gross income would continue to consist of rents, mortgage interest, real estate capital gains and the other miscellaneous real estate-related items already listed in the Code. The income a TRS would receive from both third parties and REIT tenants would be fully subject to corporate tax. \\n   To ensure that a TRS could not inappropriately reduce its corporate tax liability by shifting income to the REIT, the bill includes a number of stringent rules that limit the relationship between the REIT and the TRS. To prevent the TRS from making excessive intra-party interest payments to its affiliated REIT, the proposal contains two safeguards. One, it would apply the current anti-earnings stripping provisions of Code section 163(j) to payments between a REIT and its TRS. This would prevent the TRS from deducting intra-party interest beyond a modest amount regulated by objective criteria in the Code. Two, a 100% excise tax would be imposed on any interest payments by a TRS to its affiliated REIT to the extent the interest rate was above a commercially-reasonable rate. \\n   Also, to be certain that a TRS could not reduce its tax obligations by deducting rents to its affiliated REIT, our legislation would retain the current rules under which any payments to a REIT by a related party would not be considered qualified rents for purposes of the REIT gross income tests. The only exception would be when a TRS rents less than 10% of a REIT-owned property and pays rents to the REIT comparable to the rents the REIT charges to its unrelated tenants at the same property. Under this exception, any rents paid to the REIT that turn out to be above comparable rents would be subject to a 100% excise tax. \\n   Under our bill, a 100% excise tax is also imposed on any rents a REIT charges its tenants that are inflated to disguise charges for services rendered to the tenant by its affiliated TRS. Limited exceptions would be made when: (1) the TRS charges the same amounts for its services to both REIT tenants and third parties; (2) rents for comparable space are the same regardless of whether the TRS provides a service to the tenant; and (3) the TRS recognizes income for its services at least equal to 150% of its direct costs of providing the service to an affiliated REIT's tenants. \\n   To discourage a REIT from allocating its expenses to its TRS (which would reduce the TRS's corporate tax obligation), the proposal would impose a 100% excise tax on any improper cost allocations between a REIT and its TRS. The Treasury Department would issue guidance on proper ways to allocate such costs. \\n   Finally, the bill proposes to eliminate the use of preferred stock subsidiaries by REITs. These subsidiaries, which have been established pursuant to IRS letter rulings since 1988, allow a REIT to provide services to third parties. While the asset test rules prevent a REIT from owning more than 10% of the voting securities of these subsidiaries, they typically own more than 95% of the value of the subsidiary. We propose to eliminate these subsidiaries by prohibiting REITs from owning more than 10% of the vote or the value in another corporation other than a TRS. REITs would be given three years to convert, tax-free, their preferred stock subsidiaries to taxable REIT subsidiaries. \\n   In addition, the bill includes some miscellaneous changes to the REIT rules that were under consideration when Congress approved a REIT simplification package a few years ago. The first provision deals with health care property. Under current law, a REIT can conduct a trade or business using property acquired through foreclosure for 90 days after it acquired such property, if it makes a ``foreclosure property'' election. After this period, the REIT can only conduct the trade or business through an independent contractor from whom the REIT does not derive any income. A health care REIT faces special challenges in using these rules when its lease of a nursing home or other health care property expires. \\n   To remedy these challenges and to ensure that care to patients remains uninterrupted, the proposal would make two technical changes to the REIT foreclosure rules. First, the foreclosure property rules would be extended to include leases that terminate (they already apply to leases that are breached). Second, for purposes of the foreclosure rules, a health care provider would not be disqualified as an independent contractor solely because the REIT receives rental income from the provider with respect to one or more other properties. For this purpose, other rules would be made to ensure that the terms of leases of other properties could not be manipulated to circumvent this rule. \\n   Another provision deals with the 95% distribution rule. From 1960 through 1980, REITs and mutual funds shared a requirement to distribute at least 90% of their taxable income. Since 1980, REITs have had to distribute 95% of their taxable income. The proposal would restore the 90% distribution requirement. \\n   Mr. President, I believe this is a major improvement in the REIT rules that preserves the original intent of Congress when it first created REITs in 1960, while permitting the industry to adapt to a changing marketplace. Most importantly, these REIT modernization rules would not expand the activities that can be conducted within the REIT, they simply give the REIT greater flexibility to establish fully-taxable subsidiaries that will enable the REIT to better serve its customers. \\n   This legislation is supported by the American Resort Development Association, the International Council of Shopping Centers, the National Apartment Association, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, the American Seniors Housing Association, the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, the National Association of Industrial and Office Properties, the National Association of Realtors, the National Multi Housing Council, and the National Realty Committee. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990512\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Affordable Housing Opportunity Act of 1999. My colleague from my home state, BOB GRAHAM, my colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator SANTORUM, and 42 other members of the Senate join me as original cosponsors of this effort to make sure that the Low Income Housing Tax Credit is not undercut by the effects of inflation. \\n   The Low Income Housing Tax Credit is one federal housing program that works. It works to produce affordable rental housing by allowing states to distribute tax credits to those who invest in apartments for low income families. It works because it is decentralized, it is market-oriented, and it relies on the private sector. \\n   The Low Income Housing Tax Credit works because it is based on sound economics. This is in stark contrast to the alternative government approach to the problem of a scarcity of privately owned, affordable housing units, the approach of rent control. Under rent  control, owners are restricted in the price they can charge for their apartments. Since this dramatically reduces the return on their investment in housing, potential owners of rental units take their money elsewhere. The result, confirmed in a study of rent control in California in the early 1990s, is that rent control actually reduces the number of rental units available for low income families. \\n   There is a better way. The Low Income Housing Tax Credit is that way. Under this program, tax credits are allocated by states and their localities to investors in low income housing. In return for agreeing to charge low rents for the units produced, the investors receive a tax credit that makes up for the financial risk of the investment. Instead of mandating low rents, the program provides an incentive for property owners to charge low rents. \\n   And, as Adam Smith would have predicted, this incentive does the job. Since 1987, state agencies have allocated over $3 billion in Housing Credits to help finance nearly one million apartments for low income families, including 70,000 apartments in 1997. In my own state of Florida, the Credit is responsible for helping finance over 52,000 apartments for low income families, including 3,300 apartments in 1997. The demand for Housing Credits nationwide currently outstrips supply by more than three to one. \\n   Despite the success of the Housing Credit in meeting affordable rental housing needs, the apartments it helps finance can barely keep pace with the nearly 100,000 low cost apartments which are demolished, abandoned, or converted to market rents each year. This is because the credit has been set at an annual amount of $1.25 per resident of each state, since its creation in 1986. To make up for the loss in value of the credit due to inflation, we propose to increase this amount to $1.75 per resident and to index the amount for future inflation. It has been estimated that this will increase the stock of critically needed low income apartments by 27,000 each year. \\n   There has long existed in this body a dedication to affordable housing, an interest that knows no party lines. One of the major, early proponents of federally supported affordable housing was Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio, known in his day as Mr. Republican, whose monument chimes regularly just a few hundred yards from here. With this strong, bipartisan pedigree, I have no hesitation in asking my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me to enact this proposal--which is similar to one contained in the President's budget and is supported by the nation's governors and mayors and the affordable housing community--to ensure the continued vitality of a program that works. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990511\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I am here today because finally, Tax Freedom Day has arrived--the day the average American has earned enough income to cover his or her Federal, State and local taxes for the year. Only today--after one-third of the year has already passed--have our working men and women earned enough money to pay their taxes for the year! This is truly amazing, and it is also truly wrong. \\n   Tax Freedom Day has moved successively later into the year for the past 7 years, as the Federal Government seeks to claim a larger and larger portion of the American family income. Since 1993, Federal tax revenues have grown 52 percent faster than personal income growth. And last year alone, Federal revenues grew 80 percent faster than personal income. \\n   Florida's Tax Freedom Day is even later--Floridians will not finish earning enough to pay their taxes for the year until Friday, May 14. They also shoulder the 5th heaviest total tax burden in the country. \\n   In 1999, Federal, State and local governments are projected to collect an average of $10,298 in tax revenue for every person in the country. This year, the Federal Government will collect more tax revenue as a share of GDP--that is 20.7 percent--than at any time since 1944. This is the highest level in peacetime history. \\n   If that isn't enough to put the high Federal tax take into perspective, let me share with you a few examples of just how much taxes impede our freedom every day of the year. \\n   I brought with me a daily tax clock to illustrate just how many different times we are taxed in ways we may not even realize. Think about the different things you do in the course of your average day. Planning your family's summer vacation? Forty percent of the cost of an airline ticket is taxes! When you drive to and from work today, 54 percent of the price of a gallon of gasoline is taxes. Did you call your mother on Mother's Day? Fifty percent of the cost of your phone bill is due to taxes. \\n   Taxes infringe on our freedom--our freedom to work, our freedom to invest and our freedom to provide for our families. It is more apparent than ever that the mammoth Federal Government we have created will never be satisfied--if there is money to be had, the Federal Government will take it. \\n   That is why it is more important than ever to provide tax relief to our families. We have a balanced budget, and soon we will be working with a Federal surplus. If the Federal Government has its way, this overpayment of taxes by the American people will be spent in Washington on new Federal programs. We need to give the American people their money back. I have proposed a tax plan which will do just that by, No. 1, providing tax relief for all American income taxpayers, No. 2, encouraging economic growth and, No. 3, ensuring U.S. technological leadership in the 21st century. \\n   We need to ensure the United States keeps its status as an economic powerhouse in the next millennium. The Federal Government's role in ensuring this happens is to cut taxes and get out of the way to give the American people the freedom to pursue their own dream--not Washington's. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990511\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join my colleague JOHN BREAUX in sponsoring the Medicare Psychiatric Hospital Prospective payment System Act of 1999. \\n   This legislation will ensure the continuance of available impatient psychiatric care by reforming how Medicare pays for services in free-standing psychiatric hospitals and psychiatric units of general hospitals. It will establish a prospective payment system (PPS) Currently psychiatric hospitals are the only institutional providers of care under Medicare not scheduled to move to a PPS system. \\n   The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) made major changes in the way psychiatric hospitals are paid. It reduced incentive payments and imposed a limit on what will be paid. The result of this was that many of these providers were hit by a big cut in the first year with no transition period to adjust to the reductions. It is important that these cuts not be continued because patient care may be put at risk. A recent study found that 84% of psychiatric hospitals had payment reductions due to BBA. The average margin went from minus 3% to negative 8.7%. \\n   This legislation proposes to transition psychiatric inpatient providers to a PPS which will allow these institutions to be able to plan and adjust for the future and insure their ability to provide quality care. The proposal also provides a measure of financial relief by limiting payment reductions to no more than 5% in the next two years. This relief will then be paid back in a few years under PPS. After the third year, PPS will be in effect and per diem rates can be adjusted downward by the Secretary of Health and Human Services to pay back savings temporarily lost through the limitation of initial payment reductions. The goal is for the bill to be budget neutral over five years and fully comply with the BBA. \\n   The most important feature of this legislation is that it moves psychiatric facilities out of a cost based system and into a system where they will be paid prospectively, like most other Medicare Providers, and can manage their finances effectively to provide high quality psychiatric care. \\n   I urge my colleagues to join me in co-sponsoring this important piece of legislation. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990506\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I thank Senator GRAMM for providing this time to me to make a statement with regard to a tax cut proposal that I have. \\n   Mr. President, my job as chairman of the Joint Economic Committee is to help Congress stay focused on the right policies to keep the U.S. economy energized. What that comes down to is finding ways to make sure Washington does less of what today it does most--tax, spend, and regulate--in order to let the American people do more of what they do best--which is to build, create and innovate. \\n   With that in mind, I instructed the JEC staff to focus on creating a tax plan that would accomplish three goals: first, provide tax relief for all American income taxpayers; second, promote even stronger economic growth; and third, ensure continued technological leadership in the 21st century. The plan I would like to talk about today accomplishes these three goals, and does so within the parameters of the on-budget surplus as estimated in this year's budget resolution. It does not use one penny from the Social Security surplus. \\n   As Ronald Reagan once said, when he was defining a taxpayer--``that's someone who works for the Federal Government but doesn't have to take a civil service examination.'' This comment really gets to the heart of how the size and scope of the Federal Government affects the way we live our lives. Americans are spending more and more time working to give more and more of their hard-earned dollars in taxes every year to the Federal Government. \\n   According to the non-partisan Tax Foundation, the average dual-income family will work until May 11 this year to pay their federal state and local taxes. So, as of today, the average American family has not even finished working to pay off their taxes for 1999. \\n   This year, the Federal Government will collect more tax revenue as a share of GDP than at any time since 1944. This is the highest level in peacetime history--20.7 percent of GDP consumed by the Federal Government. \\n   Since 1993, federal tax revenues have grown 52 percent faster than personal income growth. Last year alone, federal revenues grew 80 percent faster than personal income. \\n   We have a balanced budget in 1999 and we've got balanced budgets as far as the eye can see. Soon, we'll have a federal surplus as far as the eye can see. \\n   Our challenge now is to deal with that surplus. And, I think it's easy to see what will happen to this overpayment by the American taxpayer--if we leave it in Washington's hands. There will be numerous new government programs and they will be paid for by the Federal surplus. \\n   We have to change the terms of debate--and we have to do it now before the surplus is spent. First, let's not forget that the American economy does not exist to feed the Federal budget. Now that the budget is balanced, we have to get our priorities straight. \\n   To begin with: there is no such thing as ``public money.'' Every dollar of the Federal surplus was paid into the U.S. Treasury by American taxpayers. If we have a persistent surplus, we have to give the money back. \\n   For years, my fellow Republicans and I argued that it was wrong for the Government to spend more than it took in. We were right. But now, it is equally wrong for the Government to take in more than it spends. \\n   Yes, we should cut taxes so that people can keep more of what they earn. Yes, we should cut taxes because lower taxes spur economic growth. But the real rationale for lowering taxes--the reason tax cuts are an article of faith in the Republican Party--is that high taxes trespass on our freedom--our freedom to work, our freedom to invest, our freedom to support our families. \\n   So in my mind, it is not a matter of if we cut, but how much, and how can we maximize the pro-growth impact of whatever tax cuts we decide to enact. \\n   With these thoughts in mind, I would like to focus on what they Joint Economic Committee staff has come up with as a way to give the American income taxpayer meaningful tax relief, promote savings and economic growth, and ensure the United States remains a technological leader in the 21st century. And, Mr. President, I would like to elaborate on how this plan will accomplish each of these goals. \\n   The first goal is tax cuts for all American income taxpayers. \\n   Under this plan we would double the standard deduction to $14,400 for married filers and raise the standard deduction for single filers to $7,200. Increasing the standard deduction would provide much-needed relief to all low-income taxpayers. Moreover, this provision would significantly reduce the much-discussed marriage penalty and simplify the Tax Code. Nearly three-  quarters of all taxpayers use the standard deduction and would benefit from this increase. \\n   In addition, our plan would repeal the 1993 Clinton tax increase on Social Security benefits. In 1993, President Clinton imposed this tax increase on the elderly's benefits because he said it was needed to eliminate the budget deficit. Since there is no longer a deficit, we no longer need this tax. It is time to repeal this unnecessary surcharge on Social Security recipients. \\n   The second goal is economic growth. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990506\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Thank you, Mr. President. And I thank Senator GRAMM for yielding me time. \\n   This was an issue that I did not expect to be drawn into as far as the debate was concerned. But as I have listened to it, and as I have observed my colleagues over the last several days, as the lobbying on both sides of this issue has been going on, and seeing people move back and forth, I have become concerned about how people are making decisions. \\n   Finally, we have gotten down to the crux of the matter here, and that is, at least in my opinion, how monetary policy in the United States is going to be carried out. \\n   I believe it is so important that we focus on the issue of monetary policy, because one of the underlying strengths, one of the major factors in the economic growth that we have experienced for almost 16 years is the role of the Federal Reserve, a Federal Reserve that has been committed to price stability. \\n   To do something that will weaken the influence of the Federal Reserve with respect to monetary policy would be a tragic mistake. \\n   Here is my reasoning as to how this will come about. The Treasury is selling their idea to Members that all we really want to do is give the bankers a choice--that seems to be a fair and reasonable thing to do--let them decide. \\n   I was in the banking business. This is really not a choice. You are saying to the bankers, you make a choice about where you are going to put this. They know where the cost of capital is the cheapest, and the cost of capital is going to be the cheapest in an operating subsidiary. \\n   Why is the operating subsidiary going to be the cheapest cost to them? Because there is a subsidy attached to the bank, and so the bankers naturally will go to where their costs are the cheapest. They will, in fact, put these new powers into an operating subsidiary. Having done that, there is no longer a need for them to be involved in a holding company. The holding company is the vehicle, if you will, that allows the Federal Reserve to carry out its monetary policy. \\n   The second thing that is going to occur is by voting for the use of an operating subsidiary, you are really saying you want the taxpayers to expand the subsidy that goes into the banking industry or into the financial services industry. That is an individual decision that people can make. But I think it is wrong to try to approach this question about whether I am for the bankers or whether I am not for the bankers. This is an issue about whether you want to have a monetary policy that is of value to this country. \\n   I ask Members to consider what has happened in this country in these past 16 years as far as growth is concerned. The foundation of that growth has been the commitment that this Federal Reserve, and Alan Greenspan in particular, has had to the objective of price stability. We have finally reached the point where we have attained price stability, and we are talking about tinkering around with legislation that could lessen the influence of the Federal Reserve. \\n   As Senator DOMENICI indicated earlier, as you lessen that influence, you are going to increase the influence in the executive branch over the banking industry and monetary policy in this country. That would be a tragedy. \\n   I ask my colleagues who may be wavering on this issue, this is not a choice between Secretary Rubin or Alan Greenspan or commercial banks. This is a decision about monetary policy in this country and who should, in fact, have control of it. \\n   I ask you to support the position outlined by the chairman of the Banking Committee, Senator GRAMM. \\n   I yield the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-19990506\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I move to lay that motion on the table. \\n   The motion to lay on the table was agreed to. \\n   Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990505\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I thank the Chair. \\n   Mr. President, I thank Senator GRAMM for yielding me the time. I have a comment or two with respect to the process that we have gone through in putting this legislation together. \\n   I commend Senator GRAMM. I can't think of a time in my now 17 years in the Congress where I have had a chairman of a committee that has spent as much time with the other members of the committee, walking through a particular piece of legislation, each aspect of it, making sure that each of us was prepared and educated on the various issues. There are some difficult issues that face us--the whole issue of CRA, unitary thrifts, the mixing of banking and commerce, the issue of operating subsidiaries versus affiliates, all of them complicated. \\n   I can remember not too many years ago when there was this sense in America that the model which should be followed was the Japanese banking system that people looked at and said, we ought to look at Japan, the dynamic economy they were producing in the late 1980s. I think about how much things have changed in those 10 years. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-19990505\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I will be glad to yield for a moment. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-3-19990505\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. It is a dramatic change, and here we are. We have been talking about this legislation for all those years and we haven't made the modifications we needed to make. I hope we will be successful this time. \\n   I rise in support of the underlying bill and in opposition to the Sarbanes substitute. We all know that legislation to overhaul the bank regulatory structure is long overdue, and I join many of my colleagues in thanking the chairman for his hard work in writing this bill and bringing it to the floor. \\n   I will begin by quoting the words of the Senate Banking Committee report, which I believe presents a strong case for financial modernization. It states:  \\n   The argument for legislation to rationalize our financial structure is strong. Regulatory and court decisions have eliminated many of the barriers between commercial and investment banking. The barriers separating commercial banks from investment banks have been perforated in both directions. Finally, changes in the technology and practice of financial intermediation have rendered the restrictions of Glass-Steagall increasingly ineffective and obsolete.  \\n   There is nothing particularly remarkable about that language, Mr. President. In fact, those same arguments will be made by many of my colleagues here today. But what is remarkable about the statement I just read is that it comes from a committee report on banking legislation in 1991. Just as I believed those words to be significant 8 years ago, I believe them to be even more so today. Unfortunately, there was no overhaul of our banking system in 1991. And despite much hard work and a clear need for action, there has been none since. We are long overdue for this debate and I am pleased the Senate is addressing this important issue. \\n   Freedom and free enterprise have allowed our corporate and financial institutions to respond to changing times and to adapt to a changing financial environment. But this ability has reached its limits within the confines of present law. For our financial institutions to continue to grow, to compete, and to evolve, we must give them a new legislative climate in which to operate. That is the purpose of the bill before us today. \\n   Mr. President, our banking system is truly a model for the world. Emerging economies from Asia to Africa to Central Europe look to the United States for the blueprint and technical expertise to build an effective financial infrastructure. This is happening because we have found a remarkable balance between community banks and global institutions, between the regulators and the regulated, between the States and the Federal Government, and between ordinary people and the money they need to finance their hopes and dreams. In recent years, we have witnessed a wave of high-profile mergers, as institutions across the sectors hope to create ``synergy'' from offering a broad range of financial products to an expanding global customer base. For their part, many smaller, community-based institutions are using the new regulatory authorities to offer their customers one-stop shopping for individual financial needs--from ordinary retail banking to insurance products and securities instruments. \\n   All of this is very important to the continued financial well-being of our Nation and to the global competitiveness of our financial services industry. However, the expansions I speak of are not taking place with the approval of the Congress and are not occurring through any action on our part to change the law. Rather, these things are happening because--as the 1991 report mentioned--court decisions and the broadened interpretations of present law by the banking regulators have allowed them to take place in an ad hoc manner. In order to access the right to affiliate with other sectors, financial companies have to jump over increasingly complicated regulatory hurdles in order to adapt and survive. It is high time Congress weighed in on this important trend. It is high time we cleared the way for these affiliations and repealed the underlying web of Depression-era restrictions on our banking industry. \\n   That is what we accomplish in the bill before us today, Mr. President. This legislation allows companies to diversify holdings by lifting the prohibitions on affiliations among banks, insurance companies, and securities firms, thus allowing them to compete fully in a free-market environment. If Congress fails to act, we will once  again limit the potential of our financial sector and we will continue to impose needless and unnecessary regulatory burdens on individual financial institutions. The other body is moving with its own legislation. The Senate needs to act now to ensure that our financial sector is on solid footing for the new century. \\n   The bill before us repeals the Depression-era Glass-Steagall law prohibiting affiliations between commercial and investment banks. It allows banks and insurance companies \\n   to affiliate under the same corporate umbrella. It contains provisions outlining the appropriate regulation of bank sales of insurance, and it allows banks with assets of less than $1 billion to engage in a broader range of financial services through operating subsidiaries. Of course, Mr. President, the relationships between these entities are carefully constructed to ensure institutional safety and soundness and that the taxpayer-insured deposits of retail banking institutions are protected. \\n   The structure provided for in this legislation will end the ad hoc expansion and administration of our banking sector and provide the industry with a clear roadmap for the 21st century. In my view, it will lead to greater stability, enhanced safety and soundness, and improved choices for customers and consumers. \\n   So I urge my colleagues to support passage of this important bill and defeat the Sarbanes substitute. \\n   With that, I yield the floor. \\n   Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990505\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I thank Senator GRAMM and the other Members on the floor for this time. I will be brief. \\n   I have spoken on this issue throughout my time in the Senate serving on the Banking Committee which now is into its 11th year. I also make these comments from the perspective of an individual who was president of a small bank in southwest Florida for 5 years out of a 16-year banking career. \\n   One would think, listening to the comments that have been made by the distinguished Senator from Maryland, that we were proposing to repeal CRA. We are not proposing that at all. There may be Members who want to do that, but that is not what the issue is about. The issue is about regulatory overkill. \\n   This little bank that I was president of had about $60 million in assets--very small bank--in a community that was developed, one of these Florida developments, that began in the late 1950s. To suggest that this small community bank in a very well-defined and confined market was not providing resources to that market is just absurd. If we did not lend money into that market, we would, in fact, have gone broke. So all I am suggesting is the amendment being proposed here is being sold as if we were trying to repeal CRA. The information I have is with the committee position: Only 2.8 percent of the total assets of the banking industry in America are affected by this carve-out, 2.8 percent. There were 16,000 banks audited over a 9-year period and only three of those banks--I am talking about small banks now--only three of those banks were found to be significantly out of compliance. \\n   Small banks in America need some regulatory relief. That is all we are suggesting here. Again, my experience was this little bank of $60 million in assets had to assign one individual whose job it was to put pins into a map in our market showing where we had made real estate loans. That is all we had to do. But I had to assign one person to do that. She had to put programs into effect in the bank to make sure we were complying with lending to our community. It was the only place we could have loaned. \\n   So the idea that we needed to have the Community Reinvestment Act for my bank and for small community banks is absurd. I ask my colleagues to reject the amendment and to support the committee position. \\n   I yield the remainder of my time. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990325\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Not yet. We have not used our time yet. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-19990325\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I understand I have now 6 minutes. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-3-19990325\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. It is my intention then to use 3 of those minutes and then to yield to my colleague, Senator GRAHAM, for the balance of the 3 minutes. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-4-19990325\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, let me, first of all, thank Senator DODD for his vote for this resolution. I respect immensely his viewpoint and what he has stated over all these years, but I respectfully disagree with him. Again, I will just point out, all we are suggesting here is that the least America can do is to say we ought to ask the United Nations to condemn Fidel Castro for his human rights violations. That is not an extreme position to take, to ask the world body to condemn Fidel Castro for human rights violations. \\n   The reason we are doing this is because I think it is appropriate to respond to the impression that has been created over these last several months after the Pope visited Cuba. There has been this kind of love affair that Cuba has changed, that the world is now going to open up. The Senator said a moment ago, if Cuba would open up, if we would open up, we could come together. \\n   Clearly, what has happened since the Pope's visit, Fidel Castro has arrested more dissidents than he has released following the Pope's visit. He has instituted new laws which restrict the freedom of speech, even more restrictive than in previous years. He arrested 15 people trying to celebrate the birthday of Martin Luther King this year, and just this month he arrested and sentenced four prominent activists for writing about the basic rights of the Cuban people.  \\n   Mr. President, it seems to me that this country, a country that has been willing to stand up in defense of human rights, basic human rights all over the globe, is doing the right thing. I ask my colleagues in the Senate to support this resolution. \\n   I yield back my time and yield the floor to Senator GRAHAM. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-5-19990325\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the resolution. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990318\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990318\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that S. Res. 57 be discharged from the Foreign Relations Committee and, further, that the Senate now proceed to its immediate consideration.  \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-19990318\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there now be 1 hour, equally divided, on the resolution and that the only amendment in order be an amendment to the preamble which is at the desk. \\n   I further ask unanimous consent that following the debate time, the resolution be set aside and the Senate proceed to a vote on the resolution, at a time to be determined by the two leaders. \\n   I finally ask that following the vote on the adoption of the resolution, the amendment to the preamble be agreed to and the preamble, as amended, be agreed to. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-3-19990318\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I yield myself 15 minutes. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-4-19990318\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Thank you, Mr. President. \\n   Mr. President, I am pleased to have this opportunity today \\n   to speak about Cuba and why the United States must make every effort to pass a resolution in Geneva at the U.N. Human Rights Commission condemning the Cuban Government. \\n   The reality which I seek to convey today is very simply stated. Fidel Castro continues to run Cuba with absolute power, based upon the failed ideals of the Marxist revolution that he led 40 years ago. He is a tyrant, a dictator, and an enemy of freedom, democracy, and respect for basic human dignity. \\n   As many of my colleagues know, I have been reflecting on my Senate career lately as I weighed my decision on seeking another term. Let me share one of those memories with you right now. \\n   It was October 19, 1987, when I announced my candidacy for the Senate. I traveled to Key West, the southern most point in the Continental United States, to make my announcement. I chose this location for one simple reason. I knew my passion for foreign policy arose from a deeply held conviction that America's freedom could not be taken for granted, that our freedom was not complete so long as others suffered under the yoke of tyranny. Only 90 miles from where I declared my aspiration to be a U.S. Senator in order to take part in the fight against the enemies of freedom, Fidel Castro ruled with a failed ideology and a cruel iron fist. \\n   It seems that I have been in the Senate for a long time--10 years--but if I were to travel to Key West today, I am sad to say, I could still point toward Cuba and ask the same questions I did on October 19, 1987: What does it mean to live in peace if there is no freedom to worship God, no freedom to choose our livelihood, no freedom to read or speak the truth or to live for the dream of handing over a better life to our children and our grandchildren? Peace without freedom is false. The Cuban people are only free to serve their masters in war and in poverty. \\n   Mr. President, I have many good friends in the Senate, and I have great respect for my colleagues. We share so much of our lives with each other each day. And even though we are divided on many issues, in our hearts there can be no division on our feelings for the suffering people of Cuba. \\n   The island so close to our shores serves as a tragic reminder of the human cost of tyranny and oppression and that freedom is not free. \\n   Let me propose today that Fidel Castro has not changed in 10 years; in fact, he has not changed in 40 years. In the history books, 40 years can be covered in a single sentence. But in Cuba, it can also be an eternity. \\n   I think about the 12 years since I made that speech. How many people have suffered and died needlessly in 12 years? How many screams of agony have reached for the heavens from Havana in 12 years? How many tears of sorrow and anguish have fallen in 12 years? I fear we will never know the true scale of suffering, even though it takes place so close to our shores. \\n   Some of us have served in the Senate for a few years, some of us for 10 or 12, and some of us have been here for 30 years or more. Think what it must be like serving instead in one of Fidel Castro's prisons for all that time. In Cuba you could be imprisoned simply for doing what we do each day, and that is engage in the debate of ideas. Think about how different our lives would be if we lived in a similar environment. \\n   I assure you, Mr. President, that the human spirit is a powerful thing. We know that throughout the world and throughout history mankind has struggled for freedom against the greatest of obstacles. That struggle lives, breathes, sweats, and thrives in Cuba today. But it does so at a great cost. \\n   I have two short stories I want to share to demonstrate the price being paid in Cuba today. \\n   There is a famous man known as Antunez. He began supporting freedom in Cuba in 1980. He has been in and out of prison for much of his adult life. As of February 1999, reports out of the prisons have him in poor health. \\n   I want to read a quote from a letter he wrote and successfully smuggled out of Cuba 2 years ago. I quote:  \\n   On March 15 [1997], it will be seven years that I have been imprisoned but I have yet to lose my faith and confidence in the final triumph of our struggle. I am proud and satisfied that they will have been unable to--and will never be able to--bend my will, because I am defending a just and noble cause, the rights of man and the freedom of my country.  \\n   A second story: I have recently seen a March 10, 1999, statement of Dr. Omar del Pozo, which I want to share with you today. He was a prisoner of conscience, sentenced to 15 years in prison for promoting democracy and civil society in Cuba. Through the intercession of Pope John Paul II, Dr. Pozo was released and exiled to Canada after serving 6 years of the sentence. \\n   It is interesting to note the comments of a man who owes his freedom from Cuba's prisons to the Pope's visit to Cuba. Listen to what he has to say about the so-called changes taking place within the Cuban Government. And I am now quoting:  \\n   In Castro's man-eating prisons, lives are swallowed, mangled, and spit out in what can only be described as his revolving-door of infamy. Some may claim that the fact that I am able to stand before you here today is because I am a product of engagement with Castro. While I am certainly grateful for the international outcry that created pressure on Castro to release me, it would be negligent of me not to recognize that as long as the dictator remains in power, there will continue to be political prisoners who are destined to become pawns to be handed over as tokens depending on the occasion.........my release in no way benefited the hundreds, perhaps thousands, of men and women who were left behind.  \\n   Dr. Pozo's statement certainly rings true--that the visit of the Pope and his personal release and exile from his home do not, counter to popular belief, indicate a new day in Cuba. \\n   He continues on in his statement. Again, I quote:  \\n   Forty years have passed, and a new millennium dawns, and still political prisoners exist in a country only 90 miles from the shores of the freest nation on earth........In the confusion of cliches Cuba has become in the mass media: Castro and cigars, Castro and tourism, Castro and baseball, the terrible tragedy of Cubans and their legitimate needs and desires takes a backseat to the priorities set by the Comandante en Jefe and his regime. The truly tragic part is that there are some who, in the name of profit, are willing to compromise justice and play by his rules, with no regard for the welfare of the Cuban people.  \\n   Just as actions indicate no improvement in the Government of Cuba, one could argue that things are not really getting worse. In fact, the recent crackdown in Cuba is only a manifestation of the nature of the ruling regime. Again, let me quote from Dr. Pozo:  \\n   These past days, I have heard even experienced Cuba observers question why Castro has raised the level of repression at this point in time, considering the many gestures of goodwill he has received internationally prior to and following the Papal visit. The only possible answer is that it is the nature of the beast. Castro can not help it any more than he can help being a totalitarian dictator. It is who he is and will always be. It is because he is motivated by one thing and one thing alone: [and that is] absolute power. He wants to continue to stand on the backs of the Cuban people and he will persecute, torture and kill in order to accomplish his goal of being Cuba's ``dictator for life.'' By now, everyone knows who Castro is and what he is capable of. From this point on, the field can only be divided between those who are willing to overlook his crimes and those who are not.   \\n   Again, I just point out, those were not my words. These are the words of an individual who was released from Castro's prison because of the pressure brought on by the international community and by the Pope's visit. What he is saying here is that nothing has changed as a result of the Pope's visit to Cuba. He is saying nothing has changed. And he is saying to us--not me saying, but he is saying to us--that ``the field can only be divided [now] between those who are willing to overlook [Castro's] crimes and those who are not.'' \\n   Mr. President, in conclusion, let me once again say freedom is not free, but it is the most valuable thing that we know; it is, in fact, the core of all human progress. Freedom has everything to do with our spiritual, physical, and political lives. Without it--without freedom--what would we do? It is important to think about this in order to appreciate the words of the brave men and women in Cuba fighting for freedom, because they are, after all, fighting for everything and paying a large price indeed. \\n   I want to reach out to my colleagues today. We loathe tyranny and oppression. So let us stand united behind our delegation in Geneva; let us proclaim our views at the United Nations Human Rights Commission. Let us stand tall and speak with unity, conviction, and strength. Let us proclaim: ``The \\n   United States of America abhors tyranny and loves freedom. We oppose the enemies of liberty and we support those struggling for LIBERTAD.'' \\n   That, Mr. President, represents the meaning of this resolution in its entirety. I hope my colleagues will join me today in making this most important statement. \\n   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. \\n   Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-5-19990318\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. There are no further speakers on my side, so I am prepared to yield back the remainder of my time. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-6-19990318\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I suggest the absence of a quorum. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990317\\n\\n    Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I come before the Senate today with my esteemed colleague and friend, Senator GRAHAM, to introduce the Florida Federal Judgeship Act of 1999. I would not be here today if I did not wholeheartedly believe that the problem facing the court system in the Middle and Southern Districts of Florida is one of the most acute judgeship problems in the nation. If judicial resources are not increased in these two districts, the problem will become irreversible. Mr. President, the situation that presently exists in Florida rises to the level of an emergency and thus, the problem needs attention today. \\n   The legislation that Senator GRAHAM and I are introducing would create seven new judgeships for the state of Florida. The Middle District would receive five new permanent judgeships, and the Southern District would receive two new permanent judgeships. These numbers were officially recommended by the United States Judicial Conference earlier this week. \\n   The Middle District of Florida is nearly 400 miles, spanning from the Georgia border on the northeast side to the south of Naples on the southwest coast of Florida. This district includes, among others, the cities of Jacksonville, Orlando, and Tampa. The Southern District encompasses Ft. Lauderdale and Miami, along with other cities in the southern portion of the state. \\n   Additional judgeship positions have not been created for these districts since 1990. Since this time, the Middle District alone has had a 62 percent increase in the total number of cases filed. Moreover, Florida's population has increased nearly twice as fast as the nation during the 1990s. By 2025, the United States Census Bureau projects Florida will surpass New York as the third largest state with 20.7 million residents. \\n   Each year, Florida becomes a winter home to people from all over the United States and the world. In addition, the Middle and Southern Districts  are home to major tourist attractions such as Disney World, Universal Studios, Sea World, Busch Gardens, and South Beach. The heavy flow of both winter residents and tourism, along with Florida's growing number of permanent residents, causes the needs of these two judicial districts to be unique in this nation. \\n   In addition, the Middle District contains the federal correctional center at Coleman. When the penitentiary is completed in Spring 2001, this will be one of the largest prison complexes in the country and the largest in the state of Florida. The capacity at Coleman will be approximately 4,700 inmates and all complaints filed by these prisoners regarding the facilities and their individual care will be sent to the Middle District for resolution. \\n   To add to the problem, a portion of the Middle District has been designated a High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area. While I am pleased that Florida will be receiving additional assistance in the war against drugs, we also must recognize that this law enforcement initiative is expected to dramatically impact narcotic related arrests and therefore, prosecutions in the Middle District. \\n   Thus, it is apparent that without the addition of new judges, access to justice will no longer be swift in the Middle and Southern Districts. To provide Floridians with a safe environment and access to justice, a court system must be put in place which can handle the demands of this dynamic and growing part of our country. Accordingly, I urge the Judiciary Committee and the full Senate to consider and pass this legislation expeditiously.  \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990316\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today, along with Senators GRAMS, LIEBERMAN, and KYL, I introduce the Printed Circuit Investment Act of 1999. This bill would allow manufacturers of printed wiring boards and printed wiring assemblies, known as the electronic interconnection industry, to depreciate their production equipment in 3 years rather than the 5 year period under current law. \\n   As we approach the 21st century, our Nation's Tax Code should not stand in the way of technological progress. Printed wiring boards and assemblies are literally central to our economy, as they are the nerve centers of nearly every electronic device from camcorders and televisions to medical devices, computers and defense systems. But the Tax Code places U.S. manufacturers at the disadvantage relative to their Asian competitors, because of different depreciation treatment. This disadvantage is particularly difficult for U.S. firms to bear, as the interconnection industry consists overwhelmingly of small firms that cannot easily absorb the costs inflicted by an irrationally-long depreciated schedule. \\n   As technology continues to advance at light speed, the exhilaration of competition in a dynamic market is dampened by the effects of a tax code that has not kept pace with these changes. Obsolete interconnection manufacturing equipment is kept on the books long after this equipment has gone out the door. Companies with the competitive fire to enter such a rapidly-evolving industry must constantly invest in new state-of-the art equipment, replacing obsolete equipment every 18 to 36 months just to remain competitive. U.S. investments in new printed wiring board and assembly manufacturing equipment have nearly tripled since 1991--growing from $847 million to an estimated $2.4 billion. \\n   But this investment is taxed at an artificially-high rate, because deductions for the cost of the equipment are spread over a period that is several years longer than justified. The industry is at the mercy of tax laws passed in the 1980s, which were based on 1970s-era electronics technology. It is no wonder that the market share of U.S. interconnection companies has been cut in half over this period. Our Tax Code should not continue to undermine the competitiveness of American businesses. The opportunity is before us to correct the tax laws that dictate how rapidly board manufacturers and electronic assemblers can depreciate equipment needed to fabricate and assemble circuit boards. \\n   The Printed Circuit Investment Act of 1999 will provide modest tax relief to the electronics interconnection industry and the 250,000 Americans, residing in every state in the Union, whose jobs rely on the success of this industry. This industry should get fair and accurate tax treatment.  \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990316\\n\\n    Mr. MACK. Mr. President, in an effort to help increase awareness and education about cervical cancer, and to pay tribute to women who have battled the disease, today I am submitting a Senate Resolution to designate the month of January as ``National Cervical Health Month.'' I am pleased that Senator DIANNE FEINSTEIN and 31 bipartisan colleagues in the Senate have agreed to be original co-sponsors of this Senate Resolution. I understand that Representative JUANITA MILLENDER-MCDONALD will be introducing similar legislation in the United States House of Representatives, and I would like to commend her for the leadership she has shown in this important effort. \\n   I would also like to pay tribute to Ms. Carol Ann Armenti, Director of the Center for Cervical Health in Toms River, New Jersey. Ms. Armenti has worked tirelessly on behalf of cervical cancer patients and their families, and she has been a true leader in educating women about this disease. In January, her organization, along with the American Medical Women's Association, launched the National Cervical Cancer Public Education Campaign. The leadership of Ms. Armenti will have a lasting impact upon the lives of women of today, and future generations will be the beneficiaries of her work. \\n   Mr. President, the issue of cervical cancer is one which is deeply personal to my wife, Priscilla, and to me. In 1990, our daughter, Debbie, was diagnosed with cervical cancer. Because of our family history with cancer, Debbie was aware that she had an increased risk of cancer and she made sure to take advantage of early detection screening procedures. Fortunately, her cervical cancer was detected at an early stage, and she was treated successfully with surgery. Not long after her treatment, she have birth to our third grandson. Debbie's experience with cervical cancer exemplifies the fact that early detection saves lives. \\n   According to the American Cancer Society, nearly 1,000 women in Florida will be diagnosed with cervical cancer in 1999. This year, Florida will have the third largest number of new cases of cervical cancer. Yet, despite significant progress being made in the war on cancer, not all segments of the U.S. population have benefitted to the fullest extent from the advances made in the understanding of cancer. According to the U.S. Institute of Medicine report, ``The Unequal Burden of Cancer,'' rates of cervical cancer are significantly higher in Hispanic and African-American women. We simply must reinforce our efforts to eradicate this terrible disease. \\n   Research, education, and early detection are the most effective weapons we have in the war on cervical cancer.  \\n   Research is the key to finding a cure for cervical cancer, and significant progress is being made in this regard. Last month, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) took the rarely-used step of issuing a Clinical Announcement urging physicians to give strong consideration to adding chemotherapy to radiation therapy in the treatment of invasive cervical cancer. According to NCI Director Rick Klausner, this will likely change the standard of treatment for cervical cancer. Dr. Mitchell Morris of the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center called this new treatment approach, ``the first fundamental advance in the treatment of cervical cancer in more than 40 years.'' \\n   I'm also proud to say that several cutting-edge cervical cancer studies are taking place in my home state of Florida. Scientists at the University of Miami Sylvester Cancer Center are studying a new type of cervical cancer immunotherapy. They are developing ``killer cells'' specifically designed to target cancer cells which express human papilloma virus (HPV). By eradicating these cells, the hope is to kill the tumor, even if the cancer has spread. At the H. Lee Moffitt Comprehensive Cancer Center in Tampa, studies are underway to develop a cervical cancer vaccine using some of the same characteristics of the human papilloma virus. They are also examining biomarkers to detect cervical cancer before malignant changes occur. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990311\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, a unilateral statehood declaration by chairman Arafat would constitute a gross violation of the Oslo accords, in effect ending the peace process. And any state that he might declare, outside of the peace process, would be illegitimate, irresponsible, and wrong. \\n   I am pleased to see this initiative has been cosponsored by 90 Senators as of this morning. But we must realize that this show of support grows from a very deep and heartfelt concern. We want peace to succeed, but Chairman Arafat's threat to unilaterally declare a state clearly threatens peace. \\n   Mr. President, last week in a statement on the Senate floor, I asked how can peace be reached while the Palestinian leadership teaches children to hate. Today I ask, how can peace be reached when the Palestinian leadership threatens to unilaterally impose a final status. \\n   I rise today to oppose this threat to the peace process. I hope the President will join us in making this statement to Chairman Arafat. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990310\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today Senator BREAUX and I introduce a bill reaffirming that the lawmaking power is the province of the Congress, not the executive branch. Our bill prohibits the Treasury Department from issuing regulations that would impose taxes on U.S. companies merely because one of their subsidiaries pays money to itself. \\n   As a general rule, U.S. corporations pay U.S. corporate income tax on the earnings of their foreign subsidiaries only when those earnings are actually distributed to the U.S. parent companies. An exception to this general rule is contained in subpart F of the Internal Revenue Code, which accelerates the income tax liability of U.S. parent companies under certain circumstances. The Treasury Department has announced, in Notice 98-35, an intention to issue regulations that will accelerate income tax liability for U.S. companies--not based on the specific circumstances enumerated in subpart F, but instead on a new ``interpretation'' of the ``policies'' that Treasury infers from that 36-year-old provision. This action crosses the line between administering the laws and making the laws, and cannot be allowed by Congress. \\n   Notice 98-35 concerns so-called ``hybrid arrangements.'' These involve business entities that are considered separate corporations for foreign tax purposes, but are viewed as one company with a branch office for U.S. purposes. U.S. companies organize their subsidiaries in this manner to reduce the amount of foreign taxes they owe. Transactions between a subsidiary and its branch have no impact on U.S. taxable income of the parent, as its subsidiary is merely paying money to itself. But the Treasury Department intends to impose a tax on the U.S. parent to penalize it for reducing the foreign taxes it owes. \\n   This effort is wrong for several reasons. First, the Treasury Department possesses only the power to issue regulations to administer the laws passed by Congress. New rules based on Congressional purpose are known as laws, and under the Constitution laws are made by Congress. \\n   Second, the Treasury Department is elevating one policy underlying subpart F--taxing domestic and foreign operations in the same manner--over the other policy of maintaining the competitiveness of U.S. companies in foreign markets. This proposed tax would put U.S.-owned subsidiaries at a competitive disadvantage. \\n   Finally, the Treasury Department should not impose a tax on U.S. companies to force these companies to reorganize in a way that increases the taxes they owe to foreign countries. The Treasury Department is not the tax collector for other nations. And by raising the foreign tax bills of U.S. companies, the Treasury Department is also increasing the size of foreign tax credits and thereby reducing U.S. tax revenues. \\n   The Treasury Department is not only making policy that it has no right to make, it is also making bad policy. Our bill places a moratorium on this lawmaking. It also directs the Treasury  Secretary to study these issues and submit a report to the tax-writing committees of Congress. Many people and organizations, including the Treasury Department, desire changes in the tax laws. But only Congress has the power to make these changes, and this is a power we intend to keep. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990310\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, the Tibetan people are suffering today in the name of freedom, and I am pleased to rise with Senator MOYNIHAN to submit a resolution in solemn commemoration of this day, March 10, in Tibetan history. \\n   It was on March 10, 1959 that the Tibetan people said, ``enough is enough.'' The city of Lhasa organized into what later became known as the ``Lhasa revolt'' on this day forty years ago, to protect their beloved leader, the 14th Dalai Lama, and to reject the impositions of Beijing. Let me provide some details. \\n   The new communist government in Beijing sent an army to invade Tibet in 1949. The People's Liberation Army quickly overwhelmed Tibetan defenses. In 1951, a Tibetan delegation went to Beijing to negotiate a peace agreement. But negotiation is too kind of a word. The Tibetan delegation was forced to sign a PRC-written document known as the ``17 Point Agreement.'' Even though it was forced upon the Tibetan government, it promised to preserve Tibetan political, cultural, and religious institutions, and so was warily accepted by the Tibetan government. \\n   Mr. President, going back to the early days of the PRC, we can see a pattern. The terms on paper protected the Tibetan way of life. But the promises proved empty. I suggest this is a lesson our President today would be wise to learn. Whether regarding Hong Kong, weapons proliferation, or trade, we must remember what Ronald Reagan taught us--``trust, but verify.'' This is especially true of our dealings with communists and authoritarian rulers. \\n   In Tibet, nine years of trying to compromise with the communists, from 1951 to 1959, failed. In fact, the restrictions on Tibet increased progressively, as did the oppression and brutality of Beijing's rule. \\n   March 10, 1959 stands out as an important day, not only in Tibet's history, but also in the history of humanity's struggle for freedom. On this day, the people of Lhasa organized a permanent guard around the Dalai Lama's palace, and demanded the withdrawal of the Chinese from Tibet and the restoration of Tibet's independence. \\n   One week later, the Dalai Lama was forced to flee his home and his people while his palace was being shelled by the PLA. It is important to note that, in a great and triumphant official act, he repudiated the 17-Point agreement. \\n   According to Chinese statistics, 87,000 Tibetans were killed, arrested, or deported to labor camps during this ``Lhasa Revolt.'' Countless tried to follow the Dalai Lama to India--unfortunately, only a very small percentage of the thousands who attempted to escape through the Himalayas to India survived. If they could successfully avoid the Chinese military--then they would succumb to malnutrition, cold, and disease. \\n   Mr. President, we are today honoring the memory of the more than 87,000 Tibetans who paid with their lives for the preservation of Tibet. We also honor the 6 million Tibetans today who keep alive the hope of one-day returning home. \\n   Mr. President, we believe in certain inalienable rights; it is part of our constitution. I believe that our freedom cannot be complete, and we as a nation cannot achieve our fullest greatness, so long as others suffer from the yoke of tyranny and oppression. Tibet today suffers from cultural genocide at the hands of the PRC. And yet, don't they also have inalienable rights: to reject tyranny? to determine their political future including independence? to chose freedom and reject oppression? \\n   The answer, very clearly, must be a resounding ``yes.'' We have introduced  this resolution today, to register this ``yes.'' We do it for His Holiness, the Dalai Lama of Tibet. We do it for the 6 million Tibetans in the world today facing the very real and unfortunate threat of seeing their homeland destroyed and culture obliterated. And, we do it for each of us who believe that the gifts we have in our lives here do not excuse us from caring about the struggles of others. \\n   I am pleased to submit this resolution, and ask my colleagues to support its immediate adoption. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990309\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I thank the Senator for yielding. I will not use that much time. I thank the Senator for the leadership he has provided on this legislation. \\n   It was really not my intention to speak on this bill because I was under the impression that this bill had great bipartisan support, that we would bring this to the floor after coming out of committee, and it would breeze through the Senate. This is a piece of legislation that is supposedly--supposedly--supported by everybody. \\n   I am pleased to speak in favor of the Ed-Flex bill. Our children will thrive when State and local communities are given the freedom to craft their education plans according to the unique education needs of their children. Local schools do more when Washington bureaucracies do less. That is what this bill does. \\n   We are beginning the second week of consideration of this bill. We have been forced to file three cloture motions on what may be the most popular, most bipartisan legislation we will consider this Congress. \\n   I fear this may set the tone for the remainder of the 106th Congress, where consideration of any bill will be filibustered by the Democrats and drive partisanship to new heights. \\n   As I implied a moment ago, I am in some ways confused by what is happening. I do not understand how a bill that supposedly is supported by an overwhelming number of Members on both sides of the aisle has been caught up in this constant and continuous effort to amend the bill. \\n   I think the actions we have seen during this past week, and what we are anticipating through the balance of this week, raise the question about those who have cosponsored the bill and who say they are in support of it. I question whether they truly support the idea of Ed-Flex, which is to allow State and local communities to have more control over how dollars are spent. I think there is a ruse underway here. I think our colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to claim that they support the idea of giving local communities  and States more authority and more flexibility in how to spend their dollars, yet they come out here and offer amendment after amendment on this bill, knowing full well--and I ask the Senator from Tennessee if this is not the case--knowing full well the majority leader has said to them there will be other opportunities to offer these amendments on other education bills when they come forward. Is that an accurate statement? \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-19990309\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. As I said a minute ago, I really am serious now in raising questions about the sincerity of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle who purport that they are in favor of Ed-Flex but, yet, want to bog this piece of legislation down with a whole series of amendments they know are controversial. \\n   There is nothing wrong with us dealing with controversial amendments and controversial issues. We do that throughout our entire political careers. The question is the timing of it. The question is the approach. I am, again, dismayed by the attitude that is being projected here. I, again, question sincerity. \\n   Recently, we went through a 5- or 6-week period at the beginning of this new Congress with a very contentious issue dealing with the impeachment trial. But each side made a sincere effort to work with the other, and as a result I think we did a credible job. I think most people in the country think we did a credible job. Yet, on this the second piece of legislation we are considering, we are being forced to offer cloture motion after cloture motion after cloture motion--three so far. There should be no question in anyone's mind that the intention here, I believe, is now to kill this piece of legislation because it goes against their political interests. It goes against their philosophy. \\n   In all honesty, the differences in the approach about education in America is clear. Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are convinced the only way to improve education in America is to have a larger group of wiser bureaucrats in \\n   Washington make a determination about how resources ought to be allocated and what regulations ought to come down from Washington in order to solve this problem. \\n   We have a totally different view. We think if we give this money to the States and the local communities, they can make better decisions about what their top spending priority is. In some local school districts that is school buildings. In other school districts that is school books. In others, that is teachers. We ought to allow them to make those decisions. We should not stand in their way. \\n   Again, I came here to raise these points with respect to the process, as much as anything else. I remind everyone that, in the last Congress, there were 69 cloture motions that were filed--69 cloture motions. And here we are again battling along party lines about a bill that we were told might pass with 100 votes. I have serious reservations now whether that is going to happen. I think the actions of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are very clear. They are now trying to kill the idea of allowing States and local communities to have more flexibility. \\n   Again, I appreciate the work and the effort of the Senator from Tennessee on this issue. He has provided great leadership and I appreciate the opportunity and the time he has given me. \\n   With that, I yield the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990308\\n\\n    Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for Senate Resolution 57 condemning the Cuban government's human rights record and calling on the President to make all efforts necessary to pass a resolution condemning Cuba at the UN Human Rights Commission meeting in Geneva, Switzerland. \\n   Many people have written and spoken about the latest crackdown in Cuba as if they were discovering for the first time the nature of Fidel Castro's brutal regime. Fidel Castro is a tyrant. He rules with absolute authority and uses fear and greed to maintain his power. For forty years he has demonstrated to us his nature. He has not changed. We must continue our pressure on him--voice our opposition to him. And we must continue our support for the struggling Cuban people. The choice should not be difficult to make: we must stand with those suffering under one of the few totalitarian Marxists remaining in power in the world, and we must stand up to condemn the actions of the brutal regime. \\n   One clear reminder of who we are dealing with is the murder in the Florida straits of four Americans in 1996. They were flying a humanitarian mission when the Cuban Air Force shot their unarmed aircraft out of the sky. For three years, Mr. President, we have all known about this murder, and for three years, I have been struggling to understand why this administration refuses to take appropriate action. \\n   The Boston Globe published a very powerful essay by columnist Jeff Jacoby to mark this anniversary. I'd like to read from it. Jeff captures the starkness of the mismatched foreign policy in place, comparing the act, which Fidel Castro committed with this administration's unprincipled response. His piece is titled ``Murder Over the High Seas.''  \\n   They were trying to save lives. Three years ago this week, they paid with their own. \\n   When Armando Alejandre, Carlos Costa, Mario de la Pena, and Pablo Morales took to the skies that day in their little blue-and-white Cessna 337s, their plan was to search the Florida Straits for stranded boat people, refugees fleeing Cuba in makeshift rafts or flimsy inner tubes. There was little enough the fliers could do for any rafters they came upon--toss down food and bottled water, radio their location to the Coast Guard--but that little could make the difference between life and death. \\n   Of the four, Carlos was the most experienced. He had flown more than 500 such missions for Brothers to the Rescue, and had saved scores of boat people from drowning or dying of thirst. Armando, by contrast, was going up for only the second time. What all four had in common was a love of American liberty--and a profound concern for any Cubans so desperate to escape Fidel Castro's Caribbean hellspot that they would risk their lives to get away. \\n   On Feb. 24, 1996, Carlos, Armando, Mario, and Pablo took off from an airfield in Opa-Locka, Fla. They intended to fly just below the 24th parallel, well north of Cuba's territorial waters. Both planes contacted Havana air-traffic controllers as they approached the 24th parallel, identifying themselves and giving their position. Whereupon the Cuban Air Force, without warning and without reason, scrambled two MiG fighters and blew the rescue planes out of the sky. \\n   The Cessnas and their passengers were disintegrated by the Cuban MiGs. Only a large oil slick marked the spot where they went down. No bodies were ever recovered. \\n   Three of the men--Carlos, Mario, and Armando--were US citizens. Pablo, a former refugee who had himself been saved by Brothers to the Rescue in 1992, was a permanent US resident. What happens when four American civilians are butchered in cold blood, over international waters, by the air force of a Third World dictatorship? What terrible retribution does the United States exact for a quadruple murder so barbaric and unprovoked? \\n   The astonishing answer is: Nothing happens. There is no retribution. Indeed, the Clinton administration takes the position not only that Castro must not be punished for the four lives he destroyed, but that the victims' families must not be permitted to recover anything for their loss. \\n   In the wake of the shootdown, under intense political pressure, President Clinton agreed to sign the Helms-Burton Act. Title III of the statute allows American citizens whose property was confiscated by the Cuban government--Castro nationalized billions of dollars' worth of American assets in the 1960s--to file suit against any foreign company using that property. Title IV bars any officer of a foreign company trafficking in stolen American property from receiving a visa to enter the United States. \\n   Properly enforced, Helms-Burton would weaken Castro's grip on power by reducing the flow of foreign capital into his treasury. But Helms-Burton is not properly enforced. Title III has never taken effect because Clinton keeps suspending it (as the law permits him to do if he finds that a suspension ``will expedite a transition to democracy in Cuba''). Title IV has never taken effect because the State Department refuses to carry it out. \\n   The hobbling of Helms-Burton is a stinging insult to the memory of the four murdered men. But the Clinton administration has delivered a cut unkinder still. \\n   In 1996, the families of Armando, Carlos, and Mario sued the Cuban government for damages caused by the wrongful deaths of their loved ones, a legal remedy specifically authorized by the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act. In December 1997, Senior US District Judge James Lawrence King awarded the plaintiffs $187.7 million in damages. ``Cuba's extrajudicial killings ..... were inhumane acts against innocent civilians,'' he wrote in his final judgment. ``The fact that the killings were premeditated and intentional, outside Cuban territory, wholly  disproportionate, and executed without warning ..... makes this act unique in its brazen flouting of international norms.'' \\n   But when the families attempted to collect their judgment out of frozen Cuban assets, the Clinton administration blocked them. The president famous for feeling people's pain is less concerned with the pain of grief-stricken Americans, it would appear, than with the pain Castro might feel if the judgment were paid. \\n   The administration's position is staggering. Castro is an open and declared enemy of the United States and has been for 40 years. In sending combat aircraft to slaughter four unarmed Americans engaged in humanitarian rescue work, he committed an act of war. The response of the United States should have been to remove Castro from power and put him in the dock for crimes against humanity. (for the murder of just ``one'' American in 1989, the United States invaded Panama and seized Manuel Noriega.) \\n   Clinton's appeasement of Castro is a cruel betrayal. The families of the dead Brothers of the Rescue deserve better from their government. And the tormented people of Cuba, bleeding under Castro's whip, deserve better from their free and powerful neighbor to the north.  \\n   Mr. President, it is clear to me that the United States has failed to stand up for the protection of the individual when damaged by international terrorism. I spoke last week about this administration's failure to adequately address terrorism in the Middle East. The pattern remains consistent--appease the enemies of freedom, the advocates of terror, in the hopes that they will not strike again. This approach simply fails. I don't know how to say it any more directly that that. This approach fails. \\n   The Congress passed a law last year supporting the awarding of damages from the frozen assets of terrorist states being held by the Treasury Department to American victims. This law can help the families of the Brothers to the Rescue pilots. The President, however, waived this relief asserting our national security interests would be better served by protecting Castro's money. How can this be? Nobody has provided to me an adequate explanation of what interest would cause us protect terrorism and shun American victims. \\n   Mr. President, this resolution calls on the United States to stand up for freedom, justice, and human dignity. It states that the President of the United States should lead on this issue by having the United States introduce and make all efforts necessary to pass a resolution in Geneva condemning the human rights record of the Cuban government. Mr. President, if there is one time and one place where we are obliged to condemn human rights practices, it is at the UN Commission meeting in Geneva each year. That is what this resolution calls for, and I calls for its immediate passage.  \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990304\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to join with my distinguished colleagues, Senators CHAFEE, LIEBERMAN, and others, in introducing the Credit for Voluntary Early Action Act. This measure is an important first step towards reducing the regulatory uncertainty surrounding any possible regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. This bill will provided us a valuable platform for a thorough discussion of this important issue and I encourage all my colleagues to join us in our efforts. \\n   In my state of Florida, we learned long ago that a healthy environment is fundamentally necessary for a healthy economy. This is evidenced by our congressional delegation's historic bipartisan consensus on such important national issues as the protection of the Florida Everglades and our efforts to stop oil and gas exploration off our beaches. The citizens of my state know full well how necessary it is we keep our environment clean and pristine. \\n   I'm proud to stand with my colleagues here today and take Florida's common sense, market-based attitude on the environment to the national level. The legislation we're sponsoring today would encourage and reward voluntary actions businesses take to reduce the emission of potentially harmful greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide. \\n   Under our bill, the President would be authorized to provide regulatory credit to companies who take early voluntary action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This credit could be used to comply with future regulatory  requirements and--in a market-based approach--traded or sold to other companies as they work to meet their own environmental obligations. \\n   Participants in this innovative program would agree to annually measure, track and publicly report greenhouse gas emissions. Credit given would be one-for-one, based on actual reductions below an agreed-upon baseline. Credits issued under the program would be subtracted from total emissions allowed under future regulatory emissions requirements. \\n   I believe this approach makes sense for many reasons. For one, there are many uncertainties surrounding the issue of greenhouse gas emissions and their relation to global warming. The complexities and uncertainties associated with understanding the interactions of our climate, our atmosphere and the impact of human behavior are enormous. I have my own concerns about the science behind this issue, and have tremendous concerns about the regulatory approach outlined in last year's Kyoto agreement. It is not my intent--in cosponsoring this bill--to validate Kyoto or the underlying science. Those issues are best left to the scientists and future congresses. Today, we are simply trying to clear the way for voluntary emissions-reductions projects that would otherwise be delayed for years. And we accomplish this in a way that is not costly to the taxpayers. \\n   It makes sense to provide appropriate encouragement to businesses who want to invest in improved efficiency--those who want to find ways to make cars, factories and power production cleaner. Under our bill, these companies are encouraged--not based on government fiat or handout--to get credit for their own initiative and problem solving skills. \\n   Another reason I believe this legislation would be beneficial is because today's businesses have no control over the regulations that could be required of them down the road. Although today's Congress has no desire to legislate requirements on greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, it is extremely difficult to predict where the scientific and economic data will carry future policymakers. In my view, it makes sense to encourage businesses to be proactive in protecting themselves from any future restrictions enacted by a more regulatory-minded Congress and administration. \\n   Mr. President, all of us agree that a healthy environment is important to our future. It's time to put partisanship aside and solve our environmental problem in a way that will allow business to be in control of their own future while doing their part to address global warming. By allowing companies to earn credit for actions they take now, businesses can be prepared for any regulations in the future. \\n   I look forward to beginning an earnest debate about this issue with my colleagues in the United States Senate. I believe we have an innovative approach to confronting as issue fraught with uncertainties. We should be looking to solve more of our problems by using our free market philosophy rather than by costly Washington mandates that my not work. The Credit for Voluntary Early Reductions Act is responsible effort to validate on the national level what we've always known in Florida: a healthy environment is key to a healthy economy. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990303\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-19990303\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I understand we are in morning business. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-3-19990303\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. I ask unanimous consent to speak in morning business for not to exceed 30 minutes. I hope I will not use the full 30 minutes. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990303\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I very recently traveled to Israel. It had been several years since my last visit, and I expected this year we would bring some  important measures to the Senate floor. The timeline on the Oslo accords expires in May, and Arafat has threatened to unilaterally declare an independent state. The supplemental appropriations for the Wye River accords will soon be before us, and the timetable on the Jerusalem Embassy Act requires that the President report to the Congress why the United States Embassy has not been set up in Israel's capital city, Jerusalem. I learned a great deal during the week and I rise today to share a few simple thoughts regarding what I saw and what went through my mind as the week in Israel unfolded. \\n   Let me begin with the question that is on my mind today: How is it possible to engage in peace negotiations with people who maintain the right to obliterate you, who are filled with hatred toward you, and who harbor the dream of one day destroying your homeland? Peace is a matter of the heart. I believe in the depths of every person's heart is a desire to live in peace. But what I saw, which was the outcome of the Palestinian Authority rule, convinced me that their hearts and minds are set on other goals. The Palestinian leadership does not want peace. They want, first, their own state which they can control with total power. Then they want to use that state to eliminate the State of Israel. \\n   Let's be clear. The peace process, to be meaningful, must be about more than rules and laws and lines on a map. We can reach a short-term agreement on these points, but if the Palestinian leadership fails to abandon incitement of hatred, persecution, and terrorism, then we are all dreaming, only dreaming, and our President's behavior must be labeled foolish appeasement. There will not be peace until hearts and minds are changed, and we must focus our attention on these issues. \\n   Mr. President, many of my colleagues in the Senate and in the House are aware of the promotion of hatred contained in the Palestinian media, and more significantly in the Palestinian schoolbooks. Let me provide some examples. \\n   This is a picture that was taken off of Palestinian Authority-controlled television. It is a picture of a young girl, probably 6 or 7 years old. This is a young girl singing into a microphone. She is on a television show that would be what we would refer to as kind of a Mickey Mouse Club type of show that would be shown to children by the Palestinian Authority. I want to read to you what this little girl is singing. Again, this is a program that was produced by the people who are sitting across the table from you, supposedly negotiating peace. This is what the little girl is singing:  \\n   When I wander into the entrance of Jerusalem, \\n   I'll turn into a suicide warrior in battledress, \\n   In battledress. In battledress.  \\n   There is no way I can convey to you the emotion of actually seeing that scene on television. There is no way I can put the emotion into what she was expressing and the emotion that she was expressing as she sang those words. And after her song, she got an ovation from her classmates and from her teacher. \\n   This focuses us on the fundamental difference in approach between the Palestinians and the Israelis. I have a grandson about that age, about the age of that little girl. How would I feel if he were being taught hatred in school? If he were being taught hatred on television, how would I feel? How would you feel if your Government was teaching your children to hate? Could you conclude that they were serious about long-term peace with their neighbors? \\n   I also have some examples from Palestinian textbooks for a third-grade grammar lesson. Here is the task: ``Complete the following blank spaces with the appropriate word.'' And the sentence is, ``The Zionist enemy blank civilians with its aircraft.'' The correct answer is, ``The Zionist enemy attacked civilians with its aircraft.'' \\n   For seventh graders: ``Answer the following question: Why do the Jews hate Muslim unity and want to cause division among them? Give an example of the evil attempts of the Jews, from events happening today.'' These are from Palestinian textbooks today. \\n   One would expect, rather than focus on hatred, if they were serious about peace, they would focus on how the two peoples are working to live side by side. A history book for 12th graders published only last summer teaches: ``The clearest examples of racist belief and racial discrimination in the world are Nazism and Zionism.'' \\n   To see this taking place today is chilling. If you can, think about it in the context of being in Israel and being briefed by a member of the Government with respect to what is happening in what they refer to as the anti-incitement committee, which was set up by the Wye Agreement. To be sitting there and seeing this, I must say to you, was chilling. I found it to be extremely chilling. \\n   While the Government of Israel makes good-faith efforts to come to a peace agreement, the Palestinian Authority teaches children hatred. This causes me to ask, How can peace be obtained when the children are being taught hatred? \\n   Let me share another story. I attended Shabbat dinner at the home of Saul and Wendy Singer in Jerusalem. Saul worked on my staff for 7 years before moving with his wife to Israel. They just had their second child, a girl named Tamar. Wendy told the story of the day she was checking out of the hospital in Jerusalem, 2 days after giving birth. In a very ordinary and matter of fact way, the hospital gave her the necessities for bringing home a newborn baby. In addition to providing for diapers and other things we would expect, she was handed a gas mask for her baby. It is actually a tent which you put your baby under in case of a chemical weapons attack. \\n   In Israel, this preparation is routine. Everyone in Israel knows to have a gas mask ready. It just becomes a part of the craziness of everyday life. But when you bring home a newborn baby, when you bring home your baby and you get the chemical weapons tent at the hospital, then you realize how unordinary life is in Israel today. You realize that you are really simply struggling for a normal life, hoping for peace and security, praying to God, while actually living in a war zone. \\n   I had another profound meeting during this week. I met one evening privately--secretly--with Arabs who were being persecuted for their Christian faith. I met with about 10 Palestinian Christians. I will tell you just one of their stories, but I will change some of the details to protect the person I am describing. \\n   I remember an energetic man, in his early 40s, at the end of the table. I remember him because he seemed so full of life and love. He had a great smile on his face and displayed a wonderful sense of humor. I say this was memorable because, frankly, after hearing what he had been through, I do not know if I could express the sense of peace and love he did. This is his story. \\n   He had many children and very little money. He converted to Christianity in 1993. He clearly loved God, and he loved to tell people about his conversion. He described to me how in 1997, the Palestinian Authority asked him to come to the police station for questioning. When he arrived, he was immediately arrested and detained on charges of selling land to Jews. He denied this charge, since he was very poor and owned no land. He was beaten. He was hung from the ceiling by his hands for many hours. He showed me what I just said. He showed me how his hands were tied behind his back and then raised from the floor and hung that way for many, many hours. \\n   After 2 weeks, he was transferred to a larger prison where he was held for 8 months without trial. He was released in February 1998, after his family borrowed thousands of dollars to pay off the local authorities. And even though he is free, they are keeping his father in prison. They believe it is for his son's beliefs. He feels his father is being held hostage to prevent him from talking with people about his faith. Needless to say, these Christians met with me at considerable risk. They conveyed to me a message of fear and desperation. But their mere presence in the room with me demonstrated their hope, and it also caused me to ask, how can the people of Israel find peace with the Palestinian Authority while the Palestinian Authority engages in coercion and torture based upon religious beliefs? \\n   I also met with the parents of American children killed by Palestinian terrorists. In this meeting, I was struck by the courage displayed by these families after suffering the tremendous loss  of a child brutally murdered. These families told me of the hopes and dreams they had for their children. I couldn't help thinking about my own. My daughter, Debbie, traveled with me on this trip. She was in the room as these stories of brutality and murder were related. There was scarcely a dry eye in the room. \\n   I am sure Debbie was thinking about her three little boys, ages 14, 11 and 5. We were moved by the comments made by the parents as they described to us what had happened. \\n   I understand that the Palestinian Authority knows a great deal about these murderers, but they are not being punished. Some of them have gone to trial and were sentenced, but we don't know if they remain in prison. I was told that we know some have been released. \\n   There are reports that the Palestinian Authority allows them to leave prison each day and return in the evening--like free room and board more than like prison. I was also presented with stories of the lionization of these murderers in the press and again in the classrooms. Try to imagine how you would feel, try to imagine what would be going through your mind when you are dealing with the grief of the loss of your child. You know who is responsible. You know they know who is responsible. You saw them go on trial. You saw them then released. You have to ask yourself, what are we going through this peace process for? \\n   I would like to mention one story of many that I heard. Mrs. Dosberg sat directly across the table from me. When she told us of the loss of her daughter and son-in-law, the lesson of these murders became so clear--we must fight terror and we cannot back off. Mrs. Dosberg's family, her daughter, American son-in-law, and their 9-month-old daughter attended a wedding in central Israel on June 9, 1996. They decided not to bring their 2-year-old daughter along. Thank God. On the way home from the wedding they were stopped by Palestinian terrorists and killed in a so-called drive-by shooting. Fifty bullets were found to have been used in this murder, and yet, by some miracle, the baby survived. Even with a crime this gross, the Palestinian Authority did not arrest \\n   everyone involved or suspected in the shooting. One of those who remained free, it is believed, later took part in the bombing of the Apropos Cafe, killing many others. \\n   Another suspected killer, according to the Israeli Justice Ministry, was under arrest but given permission to come and go as he pleases from prison. \\n   Mohammed Dief, another suspected Palestinian terrorist, took part in the murder of two other Americans, at two different times, according to the mothers with whom I spoke. Mrs. Sharon Weinstock lost her 19-year-old son in a drive-by shooting masterminded by Dief. And only a year later, Mrs. Wachsman told me of the kidnap-murder of their son, also believed to have been planned by Dief. \\n   I am told Mohammed Dief remains a free man today. The obvious lesson--terrorists kill and those who are not jailed remain free to kill and to kill again thanks to the Palestinian Authority. \\n   How would I feel in their place? I couldn't keep the thought from my mind, as I listened. If I had lost a child and knew that the murderer or accomplices were on the loose, how would I feel? And if I knew the killer remained free to kill other people's children, how would I feel? It is so hard, hard to even consider, but I do know that I left there committed to doing whatever I could to help each of those families. \\n   Once again, I began to better understand the way the Palestinian Authority leadership was approaching peace. How can one find peace with people who do not condemn terrorism? Mr. President, how is it possible to engage in peace negotiations with people who want to teach their children to die in a holy war against you? How is it possible to engage in peace negotiations with people who persecute those of other faiths? How is it possible to engage in peace negotiations with people who keep terrorists on the loose to wreak havoc and evil against you and praise them for heroism? \\n   Today the Israeli people are exhausted by 50 years of violence against their homes and families, of sending their sons and daughters into the army, and they dream of a promised peace now. This is our hope and our dream as well. But we must not get confused. History is replete with examples of compromises which bring terror and destroy dreams. \\n   In the United States, many people seem to think that if we do not confront these obstacles to peace and if we look the other way, then we will be able to come to an agreement. The reality, however, is just the opposite. If we do not acknowledge the attitudes and acts of those at the peace table, then the peace process is already over, and we just won't admit it. \\n   In other words, the surest way to kill the peace process is to avoid confrontation, to fear upsetting a belligerent force and to avoid addressing incitement, violence, persecution and terrorism. The only way to keep the peace process alive is to focus on truth, freedom, security and justice. \\n   Israeli efforts, to date, have sought to keep the peace process alive, improve security during the negotiating process, and obtain reciprocity as a vital element of implementation. \\n   The process remains alive, but terrorism continues and is exalted by many in the Palestinian Authority, and reciprocity does not exist. The United States role has been to seek the middle ground. Unfortunately, this only rewards those willing to go to new extremes. \\n   The middle ground between Prime Minister Netanyahu and Chairman Arafat is not halfway between the two. The United States must not engage in moral equivocation. We must not shy away from holding Arafat responsible for acts of violence, incitement and persecution. \\n   The United States must demonstrate principled leadership and end the appeasement that perpetuates the cycle of violence. The peace process can only work when leaders uphold their agreements and answer to the people, and the United States remains a vigilant defender of the principles which bind us to Israel: freedom, democracy, and the rule of law. \\n   What should we do? I believe there are three things. First, we should insist upon the strict adherence to Oslo and the reciprocity codified at Wye. The purpose of the Wye accord was at long last to force the Palestinians to comply with commitments before further territory would be turned over. \\n   So at Wye, Israel agreed only to turn over territory in phases, in which it could verify Palestinian compliance at each and every step. In the first phase, Israel completed its redeployment after the Palestinian Authority completed its tasks. In phase 2, the Palestinians did not meet all their obligations and, therefore, Israel has not yet turned over the additional land. Reciprocity makes no sense unless it is based upon this formulation. Once Israel has ceded territory, it is unlikely it ever could recover it. The Palestinians, on the other hand, can turn on and off their promises. In fact, this is exactly what they have done. \\n   Second, we should stop paying Arafat. Any funds provided to the Palestinian people should continue to go through private voluntary organizations. We should also monitor much more closely the rampant corruption and mismanagement of funds provided currently. \\n   And third, we must aggressively seek the bringing to justice of Palestinian terrorists who killed American citizens. I am told that our Justice Department can do a better job here, that they have a great deal of information on the murderers of the Americans who are free in the Palestinian areas and, indeed, can make some requests for indictments. It is time to do this. Let's put the needs of the American families and other victims' families over the needs of those engaging in or supporting terrorism. \\n   Mr. President, these are very basic principles. I am not discussing today the intricacies of the peace process, U.S. funding, embassies, or any other number of issues we will be discussing this year in the Senate. We need to focus on a more fundamental level first. And I hope that this message will be heard at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. \\n   What I mean when I say this is that I hope the President will hear the message. I say this from a standpoint not of arrogance, not of confrontation, and I do not mean it in a political way. I just hope that the President will listen  and take another look at what he and his foreign policy team are trying to force the Israeli Government to do. \\n   There cannot be peace until there is a change of heart. I returned from this trip with a newfound concern for the future of Israel. I saw examples of incitement. I heard examples of persecution and hatred being taught throughout Palestinian society by their leaders. When the people engaged in peace talks return from the negotiating table only to disparage compromise and incite violence, there can be no progress towards peace. \\n   Israel has come a long way since I first began following the fate of this state and the people of Israel. In so many respects, life appears and feels normal. The economy is developing, the standard of living is growing and improving. But just below the surface of this normalcy, Mr. President, Israel still faces a threat to the state's very existence. Israel's survival remains, unfortunately, a very real and central concern 50 years after its independence. \\n   Some people believe, however, that by ignoring this threat, that the peace process can succeed. Mr. President, it will fail. It is clear to me that many in the Palestinian leadership today see the peace process toward the goal of eliminating the State of Israel. \\n   I suggest today that we get back to the basics. Peace is not possible while teaching children to hate and kill. Peace is not possible while persecuting those of other faiths. Peace is not possible while lionizing terrorism. We must stand up for freedom, security, and human dignity. We must stand up to ensure the security of Israel. We must stand up in the Congress, and we must insist that our President stand with us. \\n   Today is the day to end American pressure on Israel to force a peace agreement. Today is the day to remember it is up to the people of Israel to determine their own fate--their own security. We should pressure those who fill children with slogans of hatred and holy war; we should pressure them to change. We should pressure those who torture; we should pressure them to change. We should pressure those who encourage and support terror and murder, and those who rejoice in hatred. That is where the pressure should be. \\n   Now is the time, Mr. President, for a return to our principled stand. The only way to truly attain peace is to support freedom, democracy and justice, and oppose the cycle of hatred. We must face tyranny and oppression where it exists, condemn it, and stand up for peace--real peace based upon security, freedom, and a change of heart. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990303\\n\\n   Mr. MACK.

I am prepared. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-2-19990225\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. No more than 3 minutes. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-3-19990225\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, if there is ever a time and place to raise human rights concerns, it is at the annual meeting of the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva, Switzerland. That Commission is meeting right now. And I rise today to urge my fellow Senators to join with me and the 17 other cosponsors of this resolution to make a simple statement. We disapprove of the human rights abuses occurring in China and in Tibet. \\n   Since last year, when we passed this resolution with 95 votes, the President has engaged in two summits with Chinese President Jiang. During that time, many promises were made and agreements were concluded, and the United States did not introduce a human rights resolution in Geneva. \\n   We were told the United States would make progress by not introducing a resolution. And Wei Jingsheng, a prominent dissident, was released. Tomorrow, Mr. Wei will be here in Washington, DC, and he will urge the United States not to make the same mistake as last year. Mr. President, we must now make this statement of condemnation of China's human rights practices. \\n   We received many promises from the Chinese Government last year as well. But we know that the human rights conditions have only deteriorated. The State Department's human rights report clearly delineates the atrocities occurring in China and Tibet. And we know from press accounts that the crackdown on human rights and political activists has hardened. \\n   It is unconscionable that the United States would not take a stand against these blatant atrocities, especially when they are documented by our own State Department. By remaining \\n   silent, we do a great injustice to those fighting for freedom, democracy, and the rule of law inside China and Tibet. \\n   Mr. President, I want to quote from a statement made by Mr. Wei not long after he was released and exiled from his country. And this is what he said:  \\n   Democracy and freedom are among the loftiest ideals of humanity, and they are the most sacred rights of mankind. Those who already enjoy democracy, liberty and human rights, in particular, should not allow their own personal happiness to numb them into forgetting the many others who are still struggling against tyranny, slavery and poverty, and all of those who are suffering from unimaginable forms of oppression, exploitation and massacres.  \\n   Mr. President, this is an easy one. It does not matter whether the world votes with us or against us or abstains in Geneva. It does not even matter if this resolution will change the minds of anyone in Beijing. We do know, however, from the firsthand testimony of released dissidents, that the actions of the United States are important to those engaged in the struggle for freedom. We know from those released that by simply making this statement we demonstrate our solidarity with those who are engaged within the daily struggle for freedom, justice, and the respect for human dignity. \\n   I hope my colleagues will join me in calling for this expression of solidarity--this stand for freedom. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990212\\n\\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. Chief Justice, today the Senate finds itself at an unlikely crossroads in American history. We have assembled as a court of impeachment to sit in judgement of our President, William Jefferson Clinton, on the charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. We have worked our will in this matter according to a process rooted in English common law, written by our Founders into the Constitution, and exercised against the Chief Executive only once before in American history. \\n   This is not a task to be taken lightly, and we have not arrived easily at our decision. The Senate today is engaged in weighty struggles that go to the very heart of our private and public lives. We are at an unlikely juncture between principle and public opinion, repentance and the rule of law, perception and punishment, forgiveness and findings of fact. These are difficult issues, Mr. Chief Justice. We approach our task fully aware that our decisions today will reverberate across this great land and throughout the length and breadth of history. \\n   There has been much discussion about how we got here. And while the answer to that question may be varied in all its permutations, then amplified in the echo-chamber that is our modern public debate, it can be said with assurance that this whole unseemly business began when the President, caught in an improper private act, took deliberate steps to conceal it. And for all the other parties blamed for our presence here today--the media, the independent counsel, the political factions opposed to the President, the House of Representatives--it must be clearly understood that this process began with the deliberate and wilful acts of the President of the United States to lie in a Supreme Court sanctioned civil rights inquiry and obstruct the due course of justice. It all started with the high-handed disregard for the law exhibited by the nation's Chief Executive. It ends today. \\n   Mr. Chief Justice, when the sound and fury of the moment has passed, and this episode can be observed with the objectivity that comes with the passage of time, I believe it will be self-evident that we have followed the Constitution to the best of our abilities. In a free, democratic society such as ours, the foundation of freedom is an independent judiciary, the rule of law, and most importantly the Constitution. Our Constitution is the framework for American society, and I have been constantly reminded throughout these proceedings of the importance of our duty to honor the dignity of this document. \\n   The magnitude of this undertaking deserves no less than a sincerity of purpose and an absolute confidence in the wisdom of our Founders. The American people should not be swayed by those who argue the prominence of this case--in all its tawdry and unseemly detail--has made unnecessary a thorough process of determining the truth. We stand in judgement of the President. Our decisions will be remembered throughout history. Our precedent may be followed by future Senates. Yet, still we have heard throughout this exercise the unfortunate call to end these proceedings, save a few weeks, and inject the politics of expediency into a monumental Constitutional undertaking. I find these arguments display a remarkable lack of confidence in the  sound and just system outlined by our Founders to address very serious charges levied against the President of the United States. \\n   I am grateful the Senate rejected those calls and put in place a responsible mechanism for the thorough airing of fact and argument. I am confident our process during this trial, though far from perfect, was appropriate. We allowed time for detailed presentations on the part of the House of Representatives and the President. We held an extensive question-and-answer session to review and clarify matters presented by both sides. And we have allowed for the appropriate and necessary deposition of key witnesses. Unfortunately, the simple fact is that the outcome of this matter was, in many minds, predetermined. In spite of this, the integrity of the process was, time and again, fought for and protected. Now--today-- it only remains for us to cast our votes. \\n   BACKGROUND \\n   I wish to address my remarks not so much to the people listening in this room today, but rather to those future generations who will look back at the record and transcripts for guidance, direction, and a more thorough understanding of the process that played out in this chamber during the first two months of 1999. I mentioned earlier the significance of the Constitution. I cannot stress enough the essential role that this historical document has played in the trial of William Jefferson Clinton. This document laid the framework for what has taken place. Be it understood, the Senate tried the President because the Constitution requires that we do so. There is no exception for popular Presidents, such as William Jefferson Clinton. The Constitution provides for this process to be applied to everyone evenhandedly. \\n   Although the trial of this President was not a trial in the traditional sense, it is important to note that if the impeachment of a President presents itself again, there is nothing restricting a more traditional trial from occurring. In fact, I would encourage future Senates to utilize a judicial proceeding more closely aligned to a typical courtroom trial. Every impeachment trial will have its own dynamic environment, determined by the political and social context in which it occurs. The \\n   trial of William Jefferson Clinton occurred in a prosperous time. The citizens of this nation are largely satisfied, the President enjoys consistently high approval ratings, and the economy is outstanding. Impeaching and then trying the President has not engendered popular public support. I make these observations for future generations who reflect on this process simply to explain the mood of our nation and the political environment in which this proceeding occurred. As a result, we should not deceive ourselves into believing that public opinion did not impact this process. I would like to believe, however, that the competing demands of expediting the process versus honoring our Constitutional duties created a struggle that produced the most fair trial possible under the circumstances. Accordingly, the process we followed and the rules complied with may not be appropriate for the next trial. The decisions made in this environment should not be considered to set precedent that is inflexible. In fact, the precedent we set deserves thoughtful consideration and reasoned critique when reflected upon in the years and decades to come. \\n   In that light, our official duties in this matter began on December 19, 1998, when the United States House of Representatives impeached the President, William Jefferson Clinton. After listening to the evidence, reading the trial memorandums and the record, and carefully considering the arguments presented by both the House Managers and White House counsel, I believe the President is guilty of both articles. \\n   Before I address the merits of the case against the President, I think it is necessary to discuss whether the crimes of perjury and obstruction of justice constitute high crimes and misdemeanors as contemplated by the Framers of our Constitution. This topic has been the subject of much controversy in the past months. \\n   It is true that private acts are the genesis of the matter before us. Had the acts stayed private, we would not be here today. The President, however, brought these private acts under our public purview and created a matter of public concern when he used his position and his power to deny and obstruct the civil rights of Paula Jones. \\n   Contrary to what has been asserted, this is not just a case about a sexual encounter between the President and a young White House intern. This instead is a case about depriving Paula Jones, an individual who sought and was granted the right to file a civil rights action against the President, of her constitutional right to a day in court, a right which nine justices of the Supreme Court unanimously decided that she deserved. And--almost unbelievably--on the heels of this Supreme Court mandate, the President seemed to strengthen his efforts to deny Paula Jones' civil rights. Once these acts moved into the public arena, forming the basis for charges as serious as perjury and obstruction of justice, it is my opinion these acts became high crimes and misdemeanors as envisioned by our Founders. While our only precedent involves the impeachments of federal judges, I am satisfied the standards used in these cases also apply to the charges levied against the President. \\n   The President of the United States is the head of the Executive Branch and the Chief Law Enforcement Officer of this nation. When the Founding Fathers established our tripartite system of government, it was decided that the three branches of government would operate as checks and balances on one another. As a result, no branch would be more powerful than the other. This structure is at the very core of our success as a Republic. \\n   By obstructing justice and lying under oath, William Jefferson Clinton violated his duty as Chief Law Enforcement Officer, disrespected the Judicial Branch of the government, and undermined the foundations of our judicial system's truth-seeking process. If I were to determine that the President's actions did not constitute high crimes and misdemeanors, I would be asserting that the Executive Branch and the Office of the Presidency are more important than the Judicial Branch, and that the President of the United States is not obligated to abide by the rule of law. As a citizen and as a Senator, I cannot, in good faith, ignore the separation of powers argument. In my view, the President's conduct was in violation of the rule of law and his actions have betrayed the trust of the people of the United States. It is my firm belief that the serious offenses committed by William Jefferson Clinton are high crimes and misdemeanors and warrant impeachment, conviction, and removal from office. \\n   Amazingly, we continue to hear the argument that although the President's actions rise to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors, he should not be removed from office. The Constitution provides if a President is found guilty of high crimes, then he is automatically removed from office. Our Constitution does not allow for finding the President guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors, and then permitting him to stay in office. Only an amendment to the Constitution would make such a step permissible. \\n   There were several points during the trial of the President when I had a visceral reaction to certain charges raised by the House Managers. This reaction occurred, each time, at precisely the point when the Managers discussed the President's strategy to attack the character of Monica Lewinsky, Kathleen Willey and others. The callous disregard for the soul of another human being and the unsympathetic wounding of the character of another carried out by the President using the apparatus of the Presidency is chilling and deserves condemnation by \\n   those who cherish freedom. \\n   Before I proceed to my view of the specific articles, it may help to explain that I approach this process unencumbered by a law degree. While that in no way gives me license to disregard the legal aspects of the matter before me, it does permit me to translate legal concepts into layman's terms. As I worked my way through the voluminous record and sat through days of the trial, I found it easiest to understand this case if I approached it in chronological order. Given that, I will discuss the Obstruction of Justice count first, because in the course of this tragic series of events, I believe the President started down this slippery slope by the actions he took, as  opposed to the words he spoke. Sadly, the words, uttered under an oath to tell the truth, came later. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-mack-fl-1-19990204\\n\\n    Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 346, a bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to prohibit the recoupment of funds recovered by states from one or more tobacco manufacturers. Starting in 1989, several states filed lawsuits against tobacco companies to recover the costs of smoking related illnesses borne by states. The lawsuits led to final settlements between each state and the tobacco industry. \\n   Now, after providing no assistance to states in their legal battles, the Administration, through the Health Care Financing Administration, is attempting to claim a portion of this money. It is my opinion that this money belongs to the individual states, and should be spent as each state sees fit. This legislation accomplishes exactly that goal. \\n   The Health Care Financing Administration's pursuit of these monies also could jeopardize state programs all over the country. In Florida, Governor Jeb Bush announced an endowment, funded by tobacco monies, to insure the financial health of vital programs for children and seniors. The endowment fund is named in honor of the late Governor Lawton Chiles, who played a key role in obtaining the tobacco settlement for the people of Florida. Other programs, funded by the settlement, have already been put in place in Florida, and would be jeopardized if the funds were suddenly not available. \\n   Additionally, the Health Care Financing Administration's plan to obtain these funds by witholding federal Medicaid payments to the states could very well affect the states' ability to provide much needed care for the millions of Americans who depend on Medicaid. \\n   The Administration's attempt to dictate how the money should be spent demonstrates a disregard for state budgeting process. I hope that my colleagues will support this bi-partisan bill that protects state tobacco settlements from federal recoupment.  \\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-20001214\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New Mexico. I thank him for his customary graciousness. As I think about this year and look across the map of the United States and look at the results in the various States, I have even greater love and affection for New Mexico than I did before the year began. \\n   Mr. President, have you noticed that many things in politics and government seem to be taking longer than usual this year? It is December 14 and the 106th Congress is surprisingly still in session. But happily that allows me to come to the Senate chamber--this great American forum, which I love and respect so much--and reflect on the extraordinary opportunity Vice President AL GORE gave me to be his running mate this year. \\n   When I accepted the Vice-Presidential nomination at the Democratic Convention in Los Angeles in August, I began by asking: ``Is America a great country or what?\\'\\' \\n   Last night, we ended that remarkable journey in a disappointing way. Nevertheless, I want to answer my question this morning by declaring: ``Yes, America is a great country!\\'\\' \\n   Let me offer to my colleagues a few reasons why I feel this way today. In selecting me, a Jewish American, to be his running mate, Vice President GORE did what no presidential candidate before him had done. That required personal courage and confidence in the American people. Today we can look back and say that the Vice President\\'s confidence was totally justified. \\n   The fact is that while my faith was the focus of the earliest reactions to my candidacy, it was not even mentioned at the end of the campaign. That is the way we all hoped it would be. And that is good news for all Americans--a fulfillment of the promise that America makes to its citizens that in this country no matter who you are or where you start, you should be able to go as far as your God-given talents and individual determination will take you. \\n   The absence of bigotry in this campaign and the fact that the Vice President and I received the second highest number of votes in history of American national elections should encourage every parent in this country to dream the biggest dreams for each and every one of their children. \\n   Anything is possible for anyone in America. \\n   In the five weeks since election day--because this turned out to be the closest election in American history--our nation\\'s greatness was tested in a different way. But I am confident that in the end our election process can only be made stronger by this experience. \\n   For one thing, it opened our eyes to some long-overlooked problems with our system of voting, to the disparities in technologies and practices that may be stopping large numbers of voters from having their votes counted and that in particular may be undermining the electoral rights of many poor and minority citizens. These problems call out for investigation and reform. \\n   Whether you are happy or sad with the results of the 2000 election, I do think every one of us should be grateful this morning that here in America, we work out our differences not with civil wars but with spirited elections. We resolve our disputes not through acts of violence but through the rule of law. And we preserve and protect our system of justice best when we accept its judgments that we disagree with most. \\n   This election is over. I congratulate Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney and wish them well. Mr. President, I had the opportunity to do that personally in a very cordial conversation this morning with the Vice President-elect, Secretary Dick Cheney. \\n   As Vice President GORE said eloquently last night, it is time now for all of us to come together in support of these United States and the shared values that have long sustained us. Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney are in my prayers, and I know they are in the prayers of all Americans, as they begin now to assume the awesome responsibilities that go with leadership of this great country. \\n   In the strong words and soft voices they both used last night, Vice President GORE and Governor Bush raised us all up and pointed America toward the reconciliation that our history expects and that our national interests now require. \\n   As they both noted last night, this was the closest election we have ever experienced, with the vote for President essentially ending in a tie, the Senate split 50-50 and the House nearly even as well. That puts a special burden, not just on Governor Bush but on all of us in Congress to work on a bipartisan basis and in a cooperative spirit. As I have in the past, I fully intend to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and with President-elect Bush to find that constructive consensus without which we will not help the American people realize their potential. \\n   For my family and me, this campaign has been a thrilling and joyful experience. It has deepened the appreciation we have for the goodness of the American people and the love and loyalty we feel for this country. We could not have asked for a more warm, open, and accepting reception as we traveled around this blessed land. We could not have been more impressed with the common sense and strong values that unite our very diverse citizenry. From their Government, it became clear to me over and over again, most of them, most of the American people, want only a little help every now and then as they work so hard to make their lives better. That is exactly what we, together, should do for them. \\n   The most powerful emotion that I feel on this morning after is gratitude. I am grateful to be an American, proud to be an American; grateful to my wife Hadassah--my love and my partner--for the devoted support she gave me and the extraordinary way she reached out to everyone she met in this campaign; grateful to our dear children and mothers and sisters and brothers and relatives and friends whose help and love sustained us; grateful to Tipper and the Gore children for being such genuine and such generous friends, and  for the skill and grace with which they conducted themselves in this campaign; grateful to the Gore-Lieberman campaign staff, whose idealism, ability, and hard work make me optimistic about America\\'s future; grateful to my Senate staff here in Washington and back home in Hartford--they have served with me on behalf of the people of Connecticut for so many years, and continue to do so with such commitment during this eventful and unusual year--grateful to the people of Connecticut whose support over the past 30 years has put me in a position where AL GORE could give me the extraordinary opportunity he did this year; and grateful to the people of Connecticut without whose backing this year I would not now have the privilege of looking forward to 6 more years of service to them and with you, my colleagues, as a United States Senator. \\n   My greatest gratitude is to Vice President GORE himself. He has been my friend and colleague for 15 years now, but I have never been prouder of him than I was this year, and than I was last night. He conducted the campaign with dignity. He presented his policies and programs with conviction. He spoke with a precision that showed respect for the American people. He stuck to the record, and he worked hard, very hard. AL GORE ran this campaign as he lives his life: with honor, intelligence, and devotion. \\n   Today, the Vice President can look back on 24 years of public service with great pride in his accomplishments, and he can look forward to the years ahead with great excitement about the unlimited opportunities that await him. I wish him Godspeed, and I look forward to his continued friendship. The Vice President knows, as I do on this morning, that Psalm 30 \\n   assures us that weeping may linger for the night but in the morning there are shouts of joy. \\n   So, today, as some of us weep for what could have been, we look to the future with faith that on another morning joy will surely come. \\n   I thank my colleagues in the Senate from both parties for their warm personal wishes and support during the last 5 months. I look forward, now, to returning to this Chamber in January and working with all of you to help improve the lives of the American people and to help elevate their respect for the institutions of our great democracy. \\n   Mr. President, I again thank my friend and colleague from New Mexico for yielding me the time, I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-20001017\\n\\n    Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, 219 years ago this month, a small army camped at the gates of a small port in Virginia. And turned the world upside down. This collection of often poorly fed, poorly paid, and poorly armed men made a sacrifice from which we all benefit today. In October 1781, a few thousand American and French soldiers laid siege to Yorktown, forced the surrender of Cornwallis and his British regulars, and won American independence. \\n   Although we often remember the victory at Yorktown, too often we lose sight of the heroic efforts that made it possible. Too often we forget that this victory was the culmination of a miraculous campaign--when two nations, two armies, and two great men put aside their differences and worked together for a common purpose. \\n   It is my opinion that no single monument or battlefield would do justice to the scope of this event. That is why I, along with my colleagues, Senators DODD, KERRY, BIDEN, ROTH, SCHUMER, MOYNIHAN, SARBANES, and CHAFEE, am privileged to call for a national commemoration of the events leading to our victory at Yorktown and the end of the American Revolution. We have been strongly supported in this effort by the work of dedicated volunteers across the country--members of the Sons of the American Revolution in all of our states. I would especially like to acknowledge the help of Albert McJoynt and Win Carroll, for their work with my staff on this important project. \\n   The Washington-Rochambeau Revolutionary Road is 600 miles of history, winding from Providence, Rhode Island to Yorktown, Virginia. In the opinion of my colleagues and I, it is well worthy of designation as a National Historic Trail. Let us document the events in the cities and towns all along the road to Yorktown and the birth of this great nation of ours. Let us celebrate the unprecedented Franco-American alliance and the superhuman efforts of Generals George Washington and Jean Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, Comte de Rochambeau to preserve that alliance in the face of seemingly unsurmountable odds. Let us create a National Historic Trail along whose course we can pause and remember these men and women, their travels, and sacrifices--from the journey\\'s beginning when Rochambeau led the French army out of Newport and Providence, Rhode Island, into New York where he joined Washington\\'s troops, and through a cross section of colonial America to its culmination at the gates of Yorktown. \\n   The story of the alliance and the march is like many in our history--full of heroic characters, brave deeds, and political intrigue. Hollywood should take note: it would make for a blockbuster--and uplifting--adventure. The story unfolds through seven states and countless towns and stars the men and women of the march who left their mark wherever they went. \\n   Each of the towns on the trail makes its own unique contribution to the tale of the journey. Hartford and Wethersfield, in my own state of Connecticut--where the two generals met and through a translator planned their  strategy. In Phillipsburg, New York, the French and American armies first joined together and faced off against the British in New York City. Here, Washington and Rochambeau planned their high risk strategy--abandoning established positions in the north and racing hundreds of miles south to surprise and trap an unsuspecting British army. In Chatham, New Jersey, the French made a show of storing supplies and building bread ovens in order to disguise their march towards Cornwallis in Virginia, to confuse the British. They moved on through Princeton and Trenton, New Jersey--sites of previous colonial victories against great odds. \\n   But the march itself is only part of the story. The unprecedented alliance between France and America was cemented during this journey. Elite troops from one of the great European powers stood with the ragtag but spirited Continental Army to face and defeat the British Empire. Men who shared no common language and had in many cases been enemies in previous wars, shared clothing and food and cultures in order to achieve their goal. And as a proud member of the Armed Services Committee I am pleased to say this was a successful Joint and Coalition operation. \\n   The trail goes through Philadelphia, Pennsylvania--then capital of the colonies. Here Washington and Rochambeau stopped their men outside town, had them clean off the dirt of the trail and marched them through town with drums beating and flags unfurled before the Continental Congress and the people of Philadelphia. The grandeur of their new European ally helped restore the spirit of America during this very uncertain time. \\n   A few days later in Chester, Pennsylvania, Washington, the normally reserved commander-in-chief, literally danced on the dock when he learned the French fleet had arrived in the Chesapeake and trapped the British at Yorktown. For the first time, it seemed that victory for the colonies was possible. The armies marched on to Wilmington, Delaware and Elkton, Maryland, where American troops were finally paid for some of their efforts, using money borrowed by the bankrupt Continental Army from General Rochambeau. \\n   There are two central characters to this drama, without whom the march, siege, and victory would have never happened--Rochambeau and Washington. French ministers hand-selected the celebrated and experienced Rochambeau for the unique ``Expédition Particulie 2re\\'\\' because of his patience and professionalism. Lieutenant General Rochambeau had a distinguished military career. More importantly, he understood the need for America to play the leading role in the war. With dignity and respect, he subordinated himself and his men to Washington and his patchwork forces. While avoiding intrigue and scandal, he overlooked improprieties and affronts, and provided needed counsel, supplies, and money to Washington and his men. He is undoubtedly one of the key forces helping Washington to victory at Yorktown, and has rightly been called ``America\\'s Neglected Founding Father.\\'\\' \\n   Our nation\\'s capital region also played its part in this story. Troops camped in Baltimore near the site of today\\'s Camden Yards. Some crossed the Potomac near Georgetown, while others \\n   camped in Alexandria, Virginia. Along the way, General Washington made a triumphal return to Mount Vernon, and hosted a celebration for his French allies. All along the route, towns were touched and thrilled by the passage of the army and events swirling around them. Within this national commemoration, we should let each tell its own story in its own way. \\n   The force that held it all together throughout the march and on to victory was General Washington. This was not a new role for him. Before the war, Washington was one of the wealthiest men in the colonies and one of its few military heroes. Only he, with his public standing and incredible resolve, could have held together the fledgling Continental Army, the divided loyalties of the American people, a meddling Congress, disloyal generals, and an international alliance, for the six years leading up to the Yorktown Campaign. He overcame his own distrust and doubt and invited his old enemies, the French--who had held him prisoner in an earlier war--to field a European army in the colonies while he was working with all his energy to evict another one. Over the years, he had used his own money and credit to pay and feed his men. And he carefully balanced the need to combine his new nation\\'s independence with delicate European sensibilities to forge a winning alliance. In these months in 1781, he took a grand risk and won the war. Although the march is not his most famous hour, in many ways it is his finest. \\n   The armies marched on through Williamsburg, Virginia until they reached positions outside Yorktown in late September. Washington and Rochambeau and their troops went on to win this battle and the war. The rest is history. We should work today to ensure that this history, in all its rich detail, is not forgotten. We have the support of many state and local and private and public historic preservation groups in our efforts to establish this trail. We should use their momentum and enthusiasm to make it a reality. This bill begins that process, by directing the Secretary of the Interior to perform a resource study on the establishment of this trail, in coordination with their activities and other Congressionally mandated programs. In a time when it seems we have few heroes, let us take the time to better remember the heroes of our past. Those who sacificed so much for our freedom today deserve no less. \\n   Mr. SESSIONS: \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-20001012\\n\\n    Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss provisions (Section 934) in the fiscal year 2001 National Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 5408) aimed at supporting efforts within the Department of Defense to develop a set of operational concepts, sometimes referred to as `Network Centric Warfare\\', that seek to exploit the power of information and U.S. superiority in information technologies to maintain dominance and improve interoperability on the battlefield. I am reiterating points here that I made in a longer and more detailed statement this past summer on June 20 on this legislation. The concept of Network Centric Warfare calls for a military that links sensors, communications systems and weapons systems in an interconnected grid that allows for a seamless information flow to warfighters, policy makers, and support personnel. I am very pleased to see that our House and Senate Conferees have made a strong statement as to the importance of this emerging theory of warfare. They have joined a chorus of voices, including experts from the Naval War College, Office of the Defense, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff to push for an acceleration of DoD efforts to analyze, understand, and implement the concepts of Network Centric Warfare. In fact, Joint Vision 2020 set the goal for the Department of Defense to pursue information superiority in order that joint forces may possess superior knowledge and attain decision superiority during operations across the spectrum of conflict. \\n   After extensive discussions with a variety of Agency and Service officials, I believe that although there are many innovative efforts underway throughout the Department to develop network centric technologies and systems, as well as to develop mechanisms to integrate information systems, sensors, weapon systems and decision makers, these efforts are too often underfunded, low-priority, and not coordinated across Services. In many cases, they will unfortunately continue the legacy of interoperability problems that we all know exist today. To paraphrase one senior Air Force officer, we are not making the necessary fundamental changes--we are still nibbling at the edges. \\n   The legislation in Section 934 of H.R. 5408 explores many of the facets of this novel Joint vision of a networked force and operations. Section 934 (b) clearly states the policy of the United States with respect to Network Centric Warfare. The legislation makes it the goal of Department of Defense to fully coordinate various efforts being pursued by the Joint Staff, the Defense Agencies, and the military departments as they develop the concepts of Network Centric Warfare. The legislation then also calls for DoD to provide two reports to Congress detailing efforts in moving towards Network Centric forces and operations. The conference language reflects the fact that both the Senate and the House had compatible provisions on Network Centric Warfare in their respective bills. The final conference language essentially reflects the more detailed Senate version; it consolidates the wording while retaining the intent and each key element of the Senate bill\\'s proposals. Therefore the points I made in a more extended statement this past summer remain applicable to the final provision, and what follows is merely a reiteration and elaboration from that statement. At this point I also particularly want to note my appreciation for the strong support, cooperation, and contributions on this provision from my friends and Committee colleagues, Senators ROBERTS and BINGAMAN. \\n   Section 934(b) calls for a report focusing on the broad development and implementation of Network Centric Warfare concepts in the Department of Defense. The Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff are asked to report on their current and planned efforts to coordinate all Dod activities in Network Centric Warfare to show how they are moving toward a truly Joint, networked force. The report calls for the development of a set of metrics as discussed in Section 934(c)(J) to be used to monitor our progress towards a Joint, networked force and the attainment of fully integrated Joint command and control capabilities, both in technology and organizational structure. These metrics should allow Congress and DoD to evaluate technology development and acquisition programs that are related to Network Centric concepts and enable policy makers to set priorities and to make difficult resource allocation decisions. \\n   The legislation also requires the Department to report on how it is moving toward Joint Requirements and Acquisition policies and increasing Joint authority in this area to ensure that future forces will be truly seamless, interoperable, and network-centric, as described in Section 934(c)(G). These Joint activities are critically necessary to achieving networked systems and operations. Unless we move away from a system designed to protect individual Service interests and procurement programs, we will always be faced with solving interoperability problems between systems. For example, strengthening the Joint oversight of the requirements for and acquisition of all systems directly involved in Joint Task Forces interoperability would provide a sounder method for acquiring these systems. We need to move away from a cold war based, platform-centric acquisition system that is slow, cumbersome, and Service-centric. As part of this review, DoD should examine the speed at which it can acquire new technologies and whether the personnel making key decisions on information systems procurement are technically training or at least supported by the finest technical talent available. The report should, as part of this review, evaluate how to ensure that Service acquisition systems are responsive to the establishment of Joint interoperability standards in networking, computing, and communications, as well as best commercial practices. \\n   As described in Section 934(c)(I), the report must also address the need for coordination of Service and Agency Science and Technology (S&T) investments in the development of future Joint Network Central Warfare capabilities. In moving towards a more Joint, networked force we must continue to ensure that we provide our nation\\'s warfighters with the best technologies. The review should evaluate where we must increase our investments in areas such as sensors, networking protocols, human-machine interfaces, training, and other technologies, especially in the face of constrained S&T budgets. The Secretary of Defense should explain how S&T investments supporting network centric operations will be coordinated across the Agencies and Services to eliminate redundancy and how and where investments will be made to better address critical warfighting technology needs. This is more important than ever as we develop our next generation of weapon systems--better coordination and establishment of common standards in the technology development stages can only help to alleviate future interoperability problems. \\n   Any investments in S&T for a network centric force must also address the role of the operator in a network centric system. The report must pay attention to the training of our combat and support personnel so that they can make the best use of information technologies, as well as investing more in  research on learning and cognitive processes so that our training systems and human-machine interfaces are optimized. The recommendations on investments in the report should also accommodate the incredible pace of change in information technologies that is currently driven by the commercial sector. Dodd must analyze the commercially driven revolutions in information technology and modify the investment strategy to best leverage those developments through cooperative R&D and utilization of dual-use technologies. \\n   Section 934(d) describes the second report, which requires an examination of the use of the Joint Experimentation Program in developing Network Centric Warfare concepts. Network Centric Warfare is inherently Joint, and the Commander in Chief of Joint Forces Command is in the best position to develop new operational concepts and test the new technologies that support it. The report calls for a proposal on how the Joint Experimentation Program and the results of its activities are to be used to develop these new operational concepts, especially with regards to the design of optimal force structures for Joint operations. \\n   The Joint Experimentation process should also be used to develop Joint Requirements, Doctrine, and Acquisition programs to support network centric operations. It should serve to identify impediments to the development of a joint information network, including the linking of Service intranets, as well as redesigning combat support functions to leverage new network centric operation concepts. The review should evaluate each of these issues. This of course does not detract from the critical role that existing Service experimentation programs will play in developing new technologies and doctrine to make our fighting forces more efficient and interoperable, which should be a part of this analysis. \\n   This legislation will help focus the Pentagon and Congress\\' attention on the need to move our military into a more information savvy and networked force. We ask that these reports set forth the needed organizational, policy, and legislative changes necessary to achieve this transformation for decision makers in the military, Administration, and in Congress. The realities of the information technology revolution will force our future military operations to be network centric. We must act now to ensure that we stay ahead of the curve in technology and, more importantly, in thinking. I look forward to receiving plans and proposals to help get us there efficiently and effectively. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-20001006\\n\\n    Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Glastonbury Youth and Family Services on its thirtieth anniversary. For a generation, this agency has provided a much needed service to the families of Glastonbury, Connecticut. \\n   The children of Glastonbury are the future leaders of our state and nation, and it is critical to our continued success that they obtain the social and educational skills necessary to compete and succeed in the twenty-first century. The many programs offered by Glastonbury Youth and Family Services helps ensure that the town\\'s children are exposed to the very best role models both inside and outside of the home. Because of the hard work and dedication of the parents, children, and workers in this program, the future of Glastonbury is very bright indeed. \\n   Glasonbury Youth and Family Services has already helped open doors for countless young people, and I am confident that the children of the community will continue to benefit from its services far into the future. \\n   Mr. President, I ask that you and all of my colleagues join me in congratulating Glastonbury Youth and Family Services on this very special anniversary.  \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-20000721\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to describe a distressing situation that 23 Connecticut oyster farmers found themselves in earlier this summer, and to offer my thanks to Mr. COCHRAN and Mr. KOHL for helping Mr. DODD and myself correct an injustice to these hardworking individuals. In early June, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) informed twenty-three Connecticut oyster farmers by letter that they must repay approximately $1.5 million total in federal disaster aid payments that were granted due to a federal error. I am pleased to say that Mr. DODD\\'s and my amendment to forgive that repayment was included in the Agriculture Appropriations bill. \\n   The oyster industry is important to Connecticut\\'s economy--prior to 1997, Connecticut\\'s annual oyster crop was second only to Louisiana\\'s. However, between 1997 and 1999, our oyster industry was devastated by a disease known as MSX, resulting in massive losses. The market value plummeted from a 1995 high of $60 million to just $10 million. \\n   In the face of this severe loss to the oyster industry, the Connecticut Farm Service Agency (FSA) approved and distributed modest disaster payments to the oyster farmers in 1999. The payments were made pursuant to the 1998 Crop Loss Disaster Assistance Program (CLDAP), which is administered by the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP). With this critically needed assistance, the oyster farmers began to rebuild their livelihoods. \\n   Earlier this year, long after the funds had been invested and for purely technical reasons, USDA determined that the payments were made in error because most Connecticut oyster farmers grow their oysters in open beds rather than controlled environments. On June 2, 2000, USDA sent each of the 23 farmers a letter stating that they must repay the disaster assistance that they received the previous year. The oyster farmers were understandably frustrated and distressed by the message. I note, Mr. President, that only a small portion of oyster farming nationwide is done within controlled environments, and that production in a controlled environment was not a prerequisite for disaster assistance following damage to Florida and Louisiana oyster farms by Hurricane Andrew. \\n   USDA has acknowledged that it bears responsibility for the error in disaster aid payments. However, USDA strongly believes that it would have ``no legislative authority to waive ineligible disaster aid payments\\'\\' without specific Congressional direction. Consequently, the Connecticut delegation has worked closely with USDA legal counsel to draft legislation exempting the oyster farmers from repaying the ineligible disaster aid. Earlier this month, the House of Representatives included such an amendment in the House Agriculture Appropriations bill; the Congressional Budget Office scored the amendment as neutral. \\n   Today, I am pleased that the Senate has also recognized the injustice of holding hardworking oyster farmers responsible for federal error by including an amendment to forgive these payments in the Senate Agriculture Appropriations bill. Again, I thank Mr. COCHRAN and Mr. KOHL and their staffs for assisting Mr. DODD, myself, and especially the Connecticut oyster farmers in correcting an unfortunate situation. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-20000719\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues in paying tribute to our departed friend and colleague, PAUL COVERDELL. \\n   The Senate today is a very sad place, it is a shaken place, because of the suddenness of PAUL\\'s death. It is also a day on which I think we, by this tragic event, are reminded that underneath the headlines and the great debates and the partisan divides and all the rest of the sound and the fury, ultimately this institution, as so many others across America, is 100 people coming to work every day, trying to get a job done. It is the hundreds and hundreds of others who work with us here, our staffs and support personnel, who constitute what to me has always seemed to be a small town. \\n   Today we are saddened and we are shaken by the loss of one of the prominent people in this small town of ours on Capitol Hill, Washington, DC, United States of America, Senator PAUL COVERDELL. \\n   My wife said to me once: Remember that being a Senator is just your job; it\\'s not you. It\\'s a great job. It\\'s an honor to hold it. It is an extraordinary opportunity. But ultimately there is a ``you\\'\\' there. \\n   That personal side of all of us comes home today as we confront, and try to absorb and deal with, the death of our friend, our colleague, our coworker, PAUL COVERDELL. \\n   It reminds us, of course, of the limits of human understanding and human capacities. As great as we are as a species, as high as we have gone, as exciting as the reaches of technology are today, ultimately we reach a point of human limitation. It is the point where we meet up with faith in God that, hopefully, transcends those limits, capacities, and doubts and moves us forward. \\n   Thinking about PAUL COVERDELL\\'s death and his life, there are two quite disparate thoughts that came to my mind--but both of them, I think, fit him. I remember when I first came to Washington--this is an old expression--somebody said to me: Remember that there is no limit to what you can accomplish in Washington if you are not looking for credit. In so many ways that have been testified to here on the Senate floor today, that wisdom fits the career of PAUL COVERDELL. He was a quiet and gentlemanly person, not looking for headlines but committed and anxious to be part of making this place work.  \\n   The second sentiment is something I heard from my own beloved mother, and I will bet everybody heard it from their mother, which is, when I was growing up, she always said to my sisters and me: You know, it never hurts to be kind to people. You gain nothing by being harsh. \\n   That, too, is a very apt description of PAUL COVERDELL: a very fine human being, a very kind human being. In the normal interactions of this extraordinary place where we work together trying to get things done, PAUL always had a smile, always a kind word. Even in the partisan moments we all are involved in on the floor, they never seemed to become personal with him. That, in both senses, is the way it should be. \\n   It is, of course, sad but always true: We tend to appreciate people more when they are gone and speak more openly of them when they are gone. I think that is the case of this quiet, strong, decent, productive man. I have a sense, in listening to the comments made, of the critical role he played in this Chamber within the Republican caucus, to transcend the divisions that exist in any group of people, particularly any group of political people, and the critical role he played helping the Senate majority leader in trying to keep the place moving and getting some things done. \\n   I can testify, of course, to the fact that PAUL was clearly a proud Republican loyal to his party. He was not hesitant to reach across party lines to look for support for something in which he believed or to offer support to someone on our side of the aisle for something in which he believed and felt was right and necessary. \\n   I had the greatest opportunity to work side by side with PAUL COVERDELL as a cosponsor of the pioneering, progressive, very important education savings account proposal he made which would have taken the basic idea of higher education savings accounts and expanded them to cover K-12 education to help parents support the improvement of their children\\'s education. There is nothing we can do in this Chamber that is much more important than facilitating a better education for all of our children. \\n   It was easy to work with PAUL. He was obviously very bright, he was understanding, and he was energetic and steadfast. It is an idea I hope those of us on both sides who support it will carry on because it is a good idea, but it is also a tribute to him. \\n   I was thinking, earlier this year on a proposal that became associated with the Clinton administration; namely, the aid package to Colombia to deter and diminish the problem of drugs coming in from that country, PAUL stepped forward and gave sturdy, steadfast, effective support which ultimately resulted in its adoption with bipartisan backing of a problem that is obviously complex and indeed cannot but help us as we go forward. \\n   We all think of Nancy today and PAUL\\'s family. We extend to them our condolences, and we hope, of course, that they are strengthened and, in some measure, comforted at this difficult time by good personal memories of their time too short with PAUL, and I am sure they are strengthened and comforted by the pride they should feel and the extraordinary record of public service that was PAUL COVERDELL\\'s life, and hopefully given ultimate strength by their faith in God. The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh. Blessed be the name of the Lord. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-20000717\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the extremely distinguished occupant of the chair. I also thank my friend from Oklahoma. I will try to respond to his graciousness by being brief. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-2-20000717\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3811, which I filed at the desk. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-3-20000717\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be dispensed with. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-4-20000717\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment along with my colleague from Connecticut, Senator DODD, and Senator LEAHY of Vermont. I ask unanimous consent Senators DODD and LEAHY be added as cosponsors to the amendment. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-5-20000717\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, we think this amendment is critical for the energy security of the Northeastern United States. Last winter, in the Northeast, we were really whacked by oil market whims, as we saw the prices of home heating oil soar, and we hovered dangerously close to heating oil supply shortages. \\n   In New England, the price of home heating oil rose from an average of $1.18 a gallon to about $1.79 a gallon in just 3 weeks\\' time. \\n   Some residents of my State were actually paying over $2 for a gallon of heating oil, which meant they were spending almost $500--some of them--to fill their tanks. Of course, lower income residents and fixed-income residents, including thousands of elderly, were faced with the tough choice of buying heating oil for their homes or food for their tables. \\n   This burdensome situation was caused by high crude oil prices, resulting from low crude oil supplies and low stocks of home heating oil converging with a downward turn in the weather that led to these price shocks that so disrupted the Northeast. \\n   There were a series of meetings and much concern last winter. I think one of the best ideas that emerged was to build on the strategic crude oil reserve that we have and to create a regional Northeast home heating oil reserve in which the Government would possess home heating oil, which at times of crisis could be moved out into the market to increase supply and therefore reduce price. \\n   I recall that one of the places that this idea was discussed was at a bipartisan meeting of Members of Congress from the Northeast with the President at the White House. He said he would take this under advisement. In fact, President Clinton did act to create a Northeast home heating oil reserve earlier this month, pursuant to his congressionally authorized authority under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. \\n   This amendment, which Senators DODD and LEAHY and I offer, would appropriate $4 million to maintain the Northeast heating oil reserve that the President has now created. The President has directed that the reserve be filled with home heating oil by conducting oil exchanges with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Therefore, there is no initial cost of filling the reserve. \\n   However, the funding that is made possible by this amendment is critical for maintaining the reserve. The reserve itself is an integral piece of ensuring that if we do encounter exorbitant prices and short supplies again this winter, we will be able to count on our own publicly owned reserves of heating oil to get us through the crisis. \\n   In fact, the following Energy Information Agency report, unfortunately, indicates that the industry at the current time is way below the desirable level of building up inventories of home heating oil, which means that if this continues as we head toward the winter and the weather turns cold, people in our region of the country are going to be suffering economically and physically. So that is the intention of offering this amendment. \\n   I do want to indicate that I am exercising my prerogative as sponsor of the amendment to modify the amendment by striking the section of the amendment that begins on line 8 on the first page, and ends at the end of the document. This section describes an appropriate trigger mechanism for releasing the home heating oil reserve. In addition, I want to change the amount of funding requested from $8 million to $4 million. Finally, I would like to specify that the offset for these funds would come from unobligated funds from the  Strategic Petroleum Reserve petroleum account in the amount of $3 million, and $1 million from the Naval Petroleum Reserve and oil shale reserves. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-6-20000717\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to the Interior appropriations bill that I think is critical for the energy security of the Northeastern United States. My amendment would fund the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve, which was created by the President on Monday, July 10. The President created this reserve under his Congressionally authorized authority under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. \\n   The Northeast region of the country is heavily dependent upon home heating oil--instead of natural gas, as is the case in much of the rest of the country--for heating homes and other buildings during cold months of the year. As heating oil is refined from crude oil that is produced both domestically and abroad, the price of heating oil is subject to the same market whims that we have seen and continue to see in gasoline and other petroleum products. The difference, however, is that when a family runs out of heating oil, they literally run out of heat. This is a dangerous situation in the Northeast, where people may face days at a time of icy-cold weather. \\n   This part winter in the Northeast, we got a taste of market whims as we saw the prices of home heating oil soar, and as we hovered dangerously close to heating oil supply shortages. The price of home heating oil rose from an average in New England of $1.18 per gallon to about $1.79 per gallon in three weeks. Some residents were paying over $2.00 for a gallon of heating oil. Lower-income residents were faced with buying heat for their homes versus food for their tables. In this instance, we saw high crude oil prices and low stocks of heating oil converge with extremely cold weather, leading to the price shocks that so disrupted the Northeast. We saw a similar situation in 1996, when prices of heating oil soared. \\n   I want to offer my amendment to ensure that this type of problem does not happen again. My amendment would appropriate four million dollars to maintain the Northeast heating oil reserve that the President has created. The President has directed that the reserve be filled with home heating oil by conducting oil exchanges with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Therefore, there is no initial cost to filling the reserve. However, this funding is critical for maintaining the reserve. The reserve itself is an integral piece to ensuring that if we do encounter exorbitant prices and short supplies again, we will be able to count on our own reserves of heating oil to get us through the crisis. \\n   I would like to exercise my prerogative to modify my amendment by striking the section of the amendment that begins on line 8 on the first page and ends at the end of the document--this section describes an appropriate trigger mechanism for releasing home heating oil from the regional reserve. In addition, I would like to change the amount of funding requested from eight million dollars to four million dollars. Finally, I would like to specify that the offset for these funds will come from unobligated funds from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Petroleum Account in the amount of three million dollars and from the Naval Petroleum and Oil Shale Reserves in the amount of one million dollars. \\n   Senator DODD joins me in offering this amendment. \\n   I thank the Chair and yield the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-20000713\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the amendment which I have cosponsored with the Senator from Pennsylvania, using the 5 minutes that have been generously allocated to me by the Democratic leader. \\n   I am proud today to join with a distinguished and diverse coalition of Senators--Senators SANTORUM, ABRAHAM, HUTCHINSON, and DEWINE; and my fellow Democrats, Senators KOHL, KERRY, TORRICELLI, and LANDRIEU--in offering this amendment which we believe is a groundbreaking package to help low-income Americans into the economic mainstream. This is a truly bipartisan approach to bring economic revitalization to American communities and families. \\n   The truth is that we could not have broken this ground if we did not first find common ground. For that we are grateful for the leadership of President Clinton and Speaker HASTERT, who reached across the partisan divide to make this project a top priority. \\n   I think the amendment that we offer today is a model of cooperation and innovation. It combines much of the President\\'s new markets initiative with the Republican-initiated American Community Renewal Act, and blends them into a progressive new synthesis for stimulating investment, entrepreneurship, and economic opportunity in poorer parts of our country. \\n   This bill encompasses the range of the Clinton-Hastert plan with a few key additions which we think will make an outstanding package even better. \\n   One important addition is aimed at fixing America\\'s asset liability or, to be more precise, closing the growing gap in asset ownership in this country which separates millions of low-income Americans from their fair shot at the American dream. \\n   We believe that one of the best ways to help close this gap is to promote the use of individual development accounts, known as IDAs. Banks and credit unions that offer these special savings accounts match the deposits dollar-for-dollar, and in return account holders commit to use the proceeds to buy a home, upgrade their education, or start a business, in other words, to build assets. \\n   The only problem with IDA programs that I see is that there are not enough of them. This addition to the Clinton-Hastert proposal will now provide the support to make that happen. \\n   Another important addition to this package, that, again, reflects bipartisan cooperation in support of economically distressed communities, is the full funding of the existing 20 second round empowerment zones. \\n   We believe this amendment reaffirms and reinforces some old American ideals, including strengthening communities, rewarding work, and encouraging responsibility. \\n   I would say, in developing this package, and in offering it as an amendment today, it is our primary objective to continue working in a bipartisan manner. To that end, Senator SANTORUM, and I, along with the other cosponsors, recognize the need to continue a dialog on the charitable choice expansion provisions in this package. \\n   Specifically, we are prepared to work to narrow the scope of the expansion to a limited number of appropriate programs, building on the charitable choice precedent that Congress established in TANF, the welfare-to-work programs, in welfare reform. \\n   I also understand that some of my colleagues, and others, have expressed concern about the provision that would allow groups receiving Federal money to require their employees to adhere to the ``religious tenets and teachings of  the organizations\\'\\' provisions. I understand their concerns and look forward to working with them as this bill, hopefully, receives independent consideration. \\n   There is too much good in this proposal that has broad bipartisan support that will be fundamentally helpful to poor people in communities in America to have the proposal fail for one or two relatively small parts of it. \\n   So I say to my colleagues that we are committed to working with Members from both sides of the aisle, with the administration, and with those community-based and faith-based organizations in the field, working in these communities, to come up with an agreement that can be passed and signed into law by the President this year. \\n   I thank the Chair and yield the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-20000711\\n\\n    Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, on June 6, 2000. we lost a very courageous, brilliant, and dedicated American, Natalie Davis Spingarn. A noted writer, public servant, and leading advocate for cancer patients, Natalie was also a good friend who I miss greatly. She suffered many health problems over the years, but she lived her life with purpose, grace, and humor. Natalie built on her own experience as a cancer patient to lead the cancer survivor movement and to work for improved care and services for cancer patients. \\n   I met Natalie in 1963, when she was the press secretary for the late Senator Abraham Ribicoff and I was a summer intern. Natalie made a great impression on me then and, quite a few years later, Natalie served as a senior intern in my Senate office where she contributed her wealth of experience and knowledge to my efforts in the area of health policy. Natalie was a trusted adviser, who endeared herself to my staff and me with her wisdom, energy, compassion, and wit. \\n   Mr. President, I would like to call the attention of my colleagues to a wonderful article about Natalie Spingarn that appeared on June 7 in The Washington Post. Natalie was a frequent contributor to the Health section of the Post, and I know she would be proud to see Bart Barnes\\' tribute reprinted in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-20000630\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I come today to the floor of this Chamber, which is so rich with history, which has been the setting of some of the most determinative moments for our democracy, to talk about the state of our civic memory. \\n   Thomas Jefferson once famously said, ``If a nation expects to be ignorant and free, it expects what never was and never will be.\\'\\' I am saddened to say that this Nation, the guardian of the Jeffersonian ethic, seems well on the way today to testing his proposition. \\n   Or so the findings of a recent survey of America\\'s college graduates would suggest. That survey reveals that our next generation of leaders and citizens is leaving college with a stunning lack of knowledge of their heritage and the democratic values that have long sustained our country. \\n   The University of Connecticut\\'s Roper Center found that 81 percent of seniors from America\\'s elite institutions of higher education received a grade of D or F on history questions drawn from a basic high school examination. Many seniors could not identify Valley Forge, words from the Gettysburg Address, or even the basic principles of the U.S. Constitution. By comparison, 99 percent of them knew who Beavis and Butthead were and 98 percent knew who the rapper Snoop Doggy Dogg was. \\n   The Roper survey also shows that most major colleges no longer require their students to study history, which helps to explain why historical illiteracy is growing in this country. Students can now graduate from 100 percent of the top colleges and universities without taking a single course in American history. And students at 78 percent of those institutions are not required to take any form of history at all. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-2-20000630\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. I do so because I believe all of us--elected officials, educators, parents, the whole of our citizenry--should be alarmed by findings, by the Nation\\'s growing ignorance of our past and what it implies for America\\'s future. When we lose the memory of our past, when we lose our understanding of the remarkable individuals, events, and values that have shaped this Nation, we are losing much of what it means to be an American. We are losing touch with the civic glue that binds our diverse Nation into a single people with a common purpose. And, I fear, we are losing sight of the lessons our history teaches us and the fundamental responsibilities we share as citizens in a free democracy. \\n   Earlier this week I had the privilege of joining with my colleague from Washington, Senator GORTON, Congressman TOM PETRI of Wisconsin, the leaders of the ACTA, and assemblage of distinguished historians at a press conference to underscore the import of this report. With the Fourth of July in the offing, we wanted to seize the opportunity of this moment of patriotism to in a sense play Paul Revere, and to begin ringing the alarm bells about the growing ignorance of the contributions that Revere and many other great men and women made to this Nation. \\n   Among the scholars who attended were: Gordon Wood, Professor of History at Brown \\n   University; John Patrick Diggins, Distinguished Professor of History, The Graduate Center, City University of New York; James Rees, Director of George Washington\\'s Mount Vernon; Jeffrey Wallin, president, American Academy for Liberal Education; and Paul Reber, Executive Director of Decatur House, National Trust for Historic Preservation. With us, in spirit if not in body, were David McCullough, the prize-winning author of the illuminative biography of Harry Truman, and the great Oscar Handlin, Professor Emeritus at Harvard. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-3-20000630\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. I will read a few excerpts, because I think they uniquely speak to the ramifications of the problem. \\n   Gordon Wood explained: ``We Americans have a special need to understand our history, for our history is what makes us a nation and gives us our sense of nationality. A people like us, made up of every conceivable race, ethnicity, and religion in the world, can never be a nation in the usual sense of the term. ..... Up until recently almost every American, even those who were new immigrants possessed some sense of America\\'s past, however rudimentary and unsophisticated. Without  some such sense of history, the citizens of the United States can scarcely long exist as a united people.\\'\\' \\n   Theodore Rabb, Professor of History at Princeton, and Chairman of the National Council for History Education, quoting historian Kenneth T. Jackson, added: `` `Our binding heritage is a democratic vision of liberty, equality, and justice. If Americans are to preserve that heritage and bring it to daily practice, it is imperative that all citizens understand how it was shaped in the past .....\\' Indeed, the office of citizen cannot be properly filled in today\\'s democratic society without an understanding of American history.\\'\\' \\n   Stephen H. Balch, President of the National Association of Scholars, concluded: ``More than most nations, America is defined by shared memories. Great deeds, stirring moments, inspiring heroes, hard-won victories, occasional defeats, and, most significantly, lofty ideals--declared, attacked, and ultimately vindicated--map our collective identity. ACTA\\'s study, `Losing America\\'s Memory,\\' thus strongly suggests that were also in danger of losing America itself. Its findings should be a wake-up call for our educators who have been clearly shirking their responsibilities.\\'\\' \\n   And David McCullough issued this succinct condemnation: ``The place given to history in our schools is a disgrace, and the dreadful truth is very few of those responsible for curriculum seem to care, even at the highest level of education.\\'\\' \\n   These wise men have more than convinced me that this is a national problem deserving national attention. In that spirit, Senator GORTON and I today are introducing a resolution that we hope will help call public attention to America\\'s growing historical illiteracy and ideally begin to mobilize a national response. This bipartisan resolution, which is cosponsored by Senators BYRD, GORDON SMITH, and CLELAND, reaffirms the value we place on our truly exceptional history and makes an appeal to begin work immediately on rebuilding our historical literacy. \\n   Our call goes out primarily to America\\'s colleges and universities to recommit themselves to the teaching of history, particularly America\\'s national history. Specifically, it urges college trustees, administrators, and State higher education officials around the country to review their curricula and reinstate requirements in U.S. history. It also encourages students to select colleges with history requirements and to take college courses in history whether required or not. \\n   We also cannot ignore the role of our public schools in contributing to this historical ignorance, so we must ask educators at all levels to redouble their efforts to bolster our children\\'s knowledge of U.S. history and help us restore the vitality of our civic memory. This point was reinforced at our press conference by Mount Vernon Director James Rees, who noted with despair that George Washington\\'s presence in elementary school curricula has been gradually disappearing. As an example, he related that the textbook being used today at the elementary school he attended contained 10 times fewer references to the father of our country than the textbook he used in his youth. \\n   Mr. President, I hope our colleagues will join us in supporting and adopting this resolution and making an unequivocal statement. As we prepare to celebrate the Fourth, I can think of no finer birthday present to the Nation, no better way to honor the anniversary of America\\'s independence, than for us first to remember what moved that determined band of patriots to lay down all for liberty, what has sustained our democracy for these many years, and for us to act so that our children and those who follow them will never forget. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-4-20000630\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Will the Chairman of the Labor Health and Human Services Appropriations Subcommittee yield for a question? \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-5-20000630\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. First, I want to compliment the chairman and the ranking member, Mr. HARKIN for bringing this bill to the Senate in a very timely way and for the committee\\'s attention to the several health programs funded by this Bill that very broadly benefit the entire Nation. \\n   I also want to compliment the chairman and the ranking member for the committee\\'s report language from last year that urged the Department of Health and Human Services to address the inappropriate use of seclusion and restraint in mental health facilities across the Nation that has resulted in tragic and unnecessary deaths and injuries. The committee\\'s language has helped focus attention on this matter and progress has been made. For example, the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) has issued interim ``conditions of participation\\'\\' rules governing the use of restraints and seclusion in facilities receiving Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement. I thank the committee for its assistance in making progress on this matter. \\n   Mr. President, what we have learned from the National Mental Health Association, the Child Welfare League, and my own states Klingberg Center is that a significant obstacle to making further progress is the high turnover rate in many of the mental health facilities across the country and the recurring need to provide training to new personnel in these facilities on the appropriate use of seclusion and restraint. To address this national problem, would the Chairman support funding a demonstration project for model training and education programs for the appropriate use of restraints? \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-6-20000630\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chairman for his continuing leadership on this matter. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-20000629\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from Arizona whom I have come to call our commanding officer in the war for campaign finance reform. I am proud to serve under him. \\n   In this long struggle to cleanse our campaign finance system, we are about to achieve a victory. In a campaign finance system that is wildly and dangerously out of control today, we are about to draw a line. We are about to establish some controls based on the best of America\\'s national principles. \\n   The campaign finance reform adopted after the Watergate scandal had two fundamental principles: that contributions to political campaigns be limited, and that they be fully disclosed. \\n   These so-called 527 organizations totally violate and undermine both of those principles. Individuals, corporations, and associations can give unlimited amounts to 527 organizations, and those contributions are absolutely secret, unknown to the public. The contributors then audaciously enjoy a tax benefit for those contributions. Today, we say no more of that. Unfortunately, contributions will continue to be unlimited to 527 organizations, but at least now the public will know. \\n   As Senator MCCAIN indicated, this is not the end of the effort to reform our campaign finance system. It is only the beginning, but it is a significant beginning. I urge my colleagues across the aisle to support it. I thank the Chair. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-20000628\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. I thank my friend and colleague from Louisiana. \\n   Mr. President, I commend my friend and colleague from Louisiana, Senator LANDRIEU, and express my strong support for her amendment to better target our Federal education funding to the schools and children who need it most. I know from our collaboration on our comprehensive new Democrat education reform plan, the Three R\\'s legislation, that Senator LANDRIEU\\'s commitment to rescuing failing schools and providing every child with a quality education is unsurpassed in this body. \\n   I also want to thank my friend and colleague from Arkansas for her devotion to this cause, and for her very eloquent statement on behalf of this amendment. \\n   As Senator LANDRIEU and many others have rightly pointed out, we are facing an educational crisis in our poorest urban and rural communities, where learning too often is languishing, where dysfunction is too often the norm, and where as a result too many children are being denied the promise of equal opportunity. It is just not right or acceptable that 35 years after the passage of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, that the average 17-year-old black and Latino student reads and performs math at the same level as the average 13-year-old Caucasian American student. We must begin to respond to this emergency with a greater sense of urgency, and that is exactly what the Landrieu amendment aims to do, infusing $1 billion in new funding for FY 2001 into the Title I program for disadvantaged students and allocating those resources to the districts with the highest concentrations of poverty. \\n   We are currently spending $8 billion a year on Title I. No one in this body questions the value or mission of Title I, which was enacted in 1965 to compensate for local funding inequities and help level the playing field for low-income students. But the unpleasant truth is that this well-intentioned program is not nearly as focused on serving poor communities as it is perceived to be, leaving many poor children without any aid or hope whatsoever. \\n   According to the Department of Education, 58 percent of all schools received at least some Title I funding, including many suburban schools with small pockets of low-income students. Of the 42 percent that don\\'t receive any Title I support, a disturbing number have high concentrations of poor students. In fact, one out of every five schools with poverty rates between 50 percent and 75 percent do not get a dime from Title I. Let me repeat that startling statistic, because the first time I heard it I did not believe it--one of every five schools that have half to three quarters of its children living in poverty receives no Title I funding. None. \\n   How does this happen? The formulas we are using to allocate these funds purposely spreads the money thin and wide. Any school district with at least 2 percent of its students living below the poverty level qualifies for funding under Title I\\'s Basic Grants formula, through which 85 percent of all Title I funding is distributed. The rest of the money is channeled through the Concentration Grant formula, which is only marginally more targeted than the Basic formula, providing aid to districts with as few as 15 percent of their students at the poverty level. As a result, almost every school district in the country--9 out of every 10--receives some aid from this critical aid pool. \\n   In fairness, Congress did make an effort to correct this imbalance in 1994 through the last reauthorization of the ESA. We approved the creation of a new Targeted formula, which puts a much heavier weight on poverty and therefore would direct a much higher percentage of funds to schools with higher concentrations of poor children. The key word there, of course, is would. Congress has unfortunately never appropriated funding through the Target formula. Not a penny, Instead, we have perpetuated a system that promises one thing and delivers another, that succeeds in letting us bring home funding to each of our districts but fails to meet its fundamental goal of helping those most in need. \\n   That is exactly what this amendment introduced by the junior Senator from Louisiana will do. Once again, I congratulate her on her leadership. This is an amendment which would put our money where the needs generally are. I urge my colleagues to support it. \\n   I thank the Chair. I yield the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-20000628\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair, and I thank my friend from Wisconsin. \\n   Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for this bill, which contains nearly identical language to a bill I introduced earlier this session and to an amendment Senators MCCAIN, FEINGOLD, and I sponsored to the Defense authorization bill. This bill deals with the proliferation of so-called stealth PACs operating under section 527 of the Tax Code. These groups exploit a recently discovered loophole in the tax code that allows organizations seeking to influence federal elections to fund their election work with undisclosed and unlimited contributions at the same time as they claim exemption from both Federal taxation and the Federal election laws. \\n   Section 527 of the Tax Code offers tax exemption to organizations primarily involved in election-related activities, like campaign committees, party committees and PACs. It defines the type of organization it covers as one whose function is, among other things, ``influencing or attempting to influence the selection, nomination, election, or appointment of any individual to any Federal, State, or local public office. .....\\'\\' Because the Federal Election Campaign Act, (FECA) uses near identical language to define the entities it regulates--organizations that spend or receive money ``for the purpose of influencing any election for Federal office\\'\\'--section 527 formerly had been generally understood to apply only to those organizations that register as political committees under, and comply with, FECA, unless they focus on State or local activities or do not meet certain other specific FECA requirements. \\n   Nevertheless, a number of groups engaged in what they term issue advocacy campaigns and other election-related activity recently began arguing that the near identical language of FECA and section 527 actually mean two different things. In their view, they can gain freedom from taxation by claiming that they are seeking to influence the election of individuals to Federal office, but may evade regulation under FECA, by asserting that they are not seeking to influence an election for Federal office. As a result--because, unlike other tax-exempt groups like 501(c)(3)s and (c)(4)s, section 527 groups do not even have to publicly disclose their existence--these groups gain both the public subsidy of tax exemption and the ability to shield from the American public the identity of those spending their money to try to influence our elections. Indeed, according to news reports, newly formed 527 organizations pushing the agenda of political parties are using the ability to mask the identities of their contributors as a means of courting wealthy donors seeking anonymity in their efforts to influence our elections. \\n   Because section 527 organizations are not required to publicly disclose their existence, it is impossible to know the precise scope of this problem. The IRS\\'s private letter rulings, though, make clear that organizations intent on running what they call issue ad campaigns and engaging in other election-related activity are free to assert Section 527 status, and news reports provide specific examples of groups taking advantage of these rulings. Roll Call reported the early signs of this phenomenon in late 1997, when it published an article on the decision of Citizens for Reform and Citizens for the Republic Education Fund, two Triad Management Services organizations that ran $2 million issue ad campaigns during the 1996 elections, to switch from 501(c)(4) status, which imposes limits on a group\\'s political activity, to 527 status after the 1996 campaigns. A more recent \\n   Roll Call report recounted the efforts of a team of GOP lawyers and consultants to shop an organization called Citizens for the Republican Congress to donors as a way to bankroll up to $35 million in pro-Republican issue ads in the 30 most competitive House races. And Common Cause\\'s recent report Under The Radar: The Attack of The ``Stealth PACs\\'\\' On Our Nation\\'s Elections offers details on 527 groups set up by politicians, Congressmen J.C. WATTS and TOM DELAY industry groups; the pharmaceutical industry-funded Citizens for Better Medicare; and ideological groups from all sides of the political spectrum, the Wyly Brothers\\' Republicans for Clean Air, Ben & Jerry\\'s Business Leaders for Sensible Priorities and a 527 set up by the Sierra Club. The advantages conferred by assuming the 527 form--the anonymity provided to both the organization and its donors, the ability to engage in unlimited political activity without losing tax-exempt status, and the exemption from the gift tax imposed on very large donors--leave no doubt that these groups will proliferate as the November election approaches. \\n   None of us should doubt that the proliferation of these groups--with their potential to serve as secret slush funds for candidates and parties, their ability to run difficult-to-trace attack ads, and their promise of anonymity to those seeking to spend huge amounts of money to influence our elections-- poses a real and significant threat to the integrity and fairness of our elections. We all know that the identity of the messenger has a lot of influence on how we view a message. In the case of a campaign, an ad or piece of direct mail attacking one candidate or lauding another carries a lot more weight when it is run or sent by a group called ``Citizens for Good Government\\'\\' or ``Committee for our Children\\'\\' than when a candidate, party or someone with a financial stake in the election publicly acknowledges sponsorship of the ad or mailing. Without a rule requiring a group involved in elections to disclose who is behind it and where the group gets its money, the public is deprived of vital information that allows it to judge the group\\'s credibility and its message, throwing into doubt the very integrity of our elections. With this incredibly powerful tool in their hands, can anyone doubt that come November, we will see more and more candidates, parties and groups with financial interests in the outcome of our elections taking advantage of the 527 loophole to run more and more attack ads and issue more and more negative mailings in the name of groups with innocuous-sounding names? \\n   The risk posed by the 527 loophole goes even farther than depriving the American people of critical information. I believe that it threatens the very heart of our democratic political process. Allowing these groups to operate in the shadows pose a real risk of corruption and makes it difficult for us to vigilantly guard against that risk. The press has reported that a growing number of 527 groups have connections to--or even have been set up by--candidates and elected officials. Allowing wealthy individuals to give to these groups--and allowing elected officials to solicit money for these groups--without ever having to disclose their dealings to the public, at a minimum, leads to an appearance of corruption and sets the conditions that would allow actual corruption to thrive. If politicians are allowed to continue secretly seeking money--particularly sums of money that exceed what the average American makes in a year--there is no telling what will be asked for in return. \\n   The bill we are addressing today gives us hope for forestalling the conversion of yet another loophole into yet another sinkhole for the integrity of our elections. The bill aims at forcing section 527 organizations to emerge from the shadows and let the public know who they are, where they get \\n   their money and how they spend it. The bill would require 527 organizations to disclose their existence to the IRS, to file publicly available tax returns and to file with the IRS and make public reports specifying annual expenditures of at least $500 and identifying those who contribute at least $200 annually to the organization. Although this won\\'t solve the whole problem, at least it will make sure that no group can hide in the shadows as it spends millions to influence the way we vote and who we choose to run this country.  \\n   Opponents of this legislation claim that our proposal infringes on their First Amendment rights to free speech and association. Nothing in our bills infringes on those cherished freedoms in the slightest bit. To begin with, the Supreme Court in Buckley versus Valeo made absolutely clear that Congress may require organizations whose major purpose is to elect candidates to disclose information about their donors and expenditures. \\n   Even without that opinion, the constitutionality of this bill would be clear for an entirely different reason. And that is that this bill does not prohibit anyone from speaking, nor does it force any group that does not currently have to comply with FECA or disclose information about itself to do either of those things. Instead, the bill speaks only to what a group must do if it wants the public subsidy of tax exemption--something the Supreme Court has made clear no one has a constitutional right to have. As the Court explained in Regan versus Taxation with Representation of Washington, 461 U.S. 540, 544, 545, 549 (1983), ``[b]oth tax exemptions and tax-deductibility are a form of subsidy that is administered through the tax system,\\'\\' and ``Congressional selection of particular entities or persons for entitlement to this sort of largesse is obviously a matter of policy and discretion .....\\'\\' Under this bill, any group not wanting to disclose information about itself or abide by the election laws would be able to continue doing whatever it is doing now--it would just have to do so without the public subsidy of tax exemption conferred by section 527. \\n   Let me address one final issue: that it is somehow wrong to apply this bill to 527s but not to other tax exempt groups. I believe deeply in the cleansing tide of disclosure, whether the contributing organization involved is a labor union, a business association, a for-profit company or a tax-exempt organization. For that reason, I worked hard with a bipartisan bicameral group of reformers to come up with a fair proposal requiring across the board disclosure from all organizations that engage in election activity. I thought we had a good proposal, but we were unable to get enough support for it to see it pass the House at this time. We should continue to work to enact such disclosure, but we cannot let that goal stand in the way of passing this urgently needed legislation now, because there are real differences between 527 organizations and other tax exempts, and these differences justify closing the loophole, even if we can\\'t enact broader reform. \\n   First and foremost, section 527 organizations are different because they are the only tax-exempts that exist primarily to influence elections. That is not my characterization. That is the statutory definition. 527s are not lobbying organizations. They are not public-interest issue organizations. They are not labor organizations or business organizations. They are election organizations, plain and simple. You can\\'t say the same about the AFL-CIO or the Chamber of Commerce, or Handgun Control or the NRA, whose primary purpose is to advocate a policy position or to represent specific constituencies. So I say to anyone who claims these groups are just like other tax-exempts, ``Read the tax code.\\'\\' \\n   Just as importantly, there is a greater need for improved disclosure by 527 organizations than there is for disclosure by other tax exempts. When the AFL or the Chamber of Commerce runs an ad, we know exactly who is behind it and where their money came from: union member dues in the case of the AFL, and business member dues in the case of the Chamber. These groups provide the basic information the public needs to evaluate the motivation of the messenger. The absolute opposite is the case with 527s. The public can\\'t know what hidden agenda may lie behind the message because so many 527s have unidentifiable names and are funded by sources no one knows anything about. \\n   In the best of all possible worlds, all money supporting election-related activity would be disclosed. But we should not allow our inability to achieve that goal now to stand in the way of closing the most egregious abuse of our hard-won campaign laws that we have seen during this election cycle. We all agree the American people have an absolute right to know the identity of those trying to influence their vote. So why let another day go by allowing these self-proclaimed election groups to operate in the shadows. Let\\'s work together, across party lines, to close the 527 loophole. \\n   We have become so used to our campaign finance system\\'s long, slow descent into the muck that it sometimes is hard to ignite the kind of outrage that should result when a new loophole starts to shred the spirit of yet another law aimed at protecting the integrity of our system, but this new 527 loophole should outrage us, and we must act to stop it. On June 8, a bipartisan majority of the Senate said that we stand ready to do so when we adopted nearly this precise language as an amendment to the Defense authorization bill. An overwhelming majority of the House of Representatives did the same when it passed this bill on June 28. We cannot retreat from what we have already said we are ready to do. We must pass this bill now. \\n   I am thrilled to support this bill. I pay appropriate tributes to Senators MCCAIN and FEINGOLD for their principled and persistent leadership of this movement to bring some sanity, openness, limits, and control back to our campaign finance laws. I have been honored to work with them in the front lines of this effort. \\n   This is a turning point. The campaign finance laws of America adopted after Watergate say very clearly that individuals cannot give more than $2,000 to a campaign. Corporations and unions are prohibited by law from giving anything. Yet we know that unlimited contributions have been given by individuals, corporations, and unions, but at least that soft money, if anyone can say anything for it, is fully disclosed. \\n   In this cycle, we have seen increasing use of the most egregious violation of the clear intention of our campaign finance laws: So-called 527 organizations that not only invite unlimited contributions from corporations, unions, and individuals, but keep them a secret. \\n   Finally, we have come to a point in the abuse of our campaign finance laws that Members can no longer defend the indefensible. This is a victory for common sense, for our democracy, for the public\\'s right to know. It has value in itself. But I hope it will also be a turning point that will lead us to further reform of our campaign finance laws. \\n   I will say this: In the battle that has brought us to the eve of this victory--that we will enjoy tomorrow, I am confident--we have put together a broad bipartisan, bicameral group committed to cleaning up our election laws, our campaign finance laws. \\n   I hope and believe the debate tonight and the vote tomorrow are the beginning of finally returning some limitation, some sanity, some disclosure, some public confidence to our campaign finance laws. \\n   I thank the Chair and thank the leaders in this effort--Senator MCCAIN and Senator FEINGOLD--and am proud to walk behind them in this. \\n   Mr. President, I yield the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-20000628\\n\\n    Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, today, along with Senator THOMPSON, I am introducing a bill at the request of the administration to amend the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949. The bill is designed to improve the federal government\\'s role in managing both its personal and real property. By granting agencies enhanced tools to handle their assets, the bill\\'s goal is to bring federal asset management into the 21st century. I invite comments on the administration\\'s proposal and look forward to reviewing them. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-20000621\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair and my friend and colleague from Kentucky. \\n   Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment offered by my friend and colleague from Connecticut. I am proud to be a cosponsor of that amendment. I respectfully oppose the amendment offered by my friend and colleague from the State of Washington. \\n   As has been amply testified to here on the floor today, Colombia is in a crisis that includes a flourishing drug trade emanating from that country, an aggressive guerrilla movement spreading within it, right-wing paramilitary operations, and human rights abuses on all sides. All of this represents a fundamental threat to democratic government, the rule of law and economic prosperity in Colombia, and undermines stability in the region. It also, closer to home, results in the sad reality of a continued massive drug flow into these United States. There has been literally an explosion of cocaine and heroin production in Colombia, and too much of it ends up in our country. \\n   The democratically elected leader of Colombia, President Pastrana, has urgently asked for our assistance and has shown strong leadership in developing a long-term comprehensive strategy for dealing with the multifaceted crisis his country faces. \\n   The United States is not pushing its way into this situation, nor are we attempting to impose an outside solution. The Colombian Government quite simply cannot carry out these constructive plans it has without substantial help from its friends abroad. Our Government has quite responsibly pledged that the United States will make a major contribution to this critical effort, and I am convinced that is in our national interest to do so. The administration\\'s budget request for what has become known as Plan Colombia seeks to help that country and other nations in the region tackle the issues of the drug trade, guerrilla and paramilitary violence, human rights abuses, internally displaced people, and economic deterioration. \\n   This assistance package would allow for the purchase of 30 Blackhawk helicopters to do the essential job of transporting counter narcotics battalions into southern Colombia. These Blackhawks are fast, they have tremendous capacity, and they are well suited for long-range operations. Unfortunately, the Senate version of the foreign operations appropriations bill eliminates the funding for the Blackhawks and replaces them with twice as many of the slower, less capable Huey II helicopters. While the Huey II is an improvement over the 1960s vintage Huey helicopter, it does not have the same performance capabilities, including range, speed, lift, or survivability, at any altitude as does the Blackhawk. \\n   The Colombian Army itself chose the Blackhawk to meet its long-term requirements for all of its forces and believes it is the best solution for providing helicopter support to the newly formed counternarcotics battalions. The Blackhawk would allow the Colombians to put more troops on the ground, more quickly and from greater distances, allowing for a higher initial entry of the battalions and for more rapid reinforcement, all necessary to achieve success against opponents on the ground. For some missions in the mountains at high altitudes, the Huey II simply will not work at all. \\n   In sum, the Colombians have concluded that the Blackhawks best suit their need for counter drug missions,  which is at the heart of our American interest in this aid package. Both General McCaffrey and General Wilhelm have strongly concurred. \\n   In addition, in May, a team of 24 U.S. Army aviation experts was sent to Colombia to conduct an assessment of the operational effectiveness and support requirements of the Blackhawks versus the Huey IIs in Colombia. In a preliminary report on its finding, the team said:  \\n   The superior troop carrying capacity and range of the UH-60L, or Blackhawk, versus the Huey II, coupled with the combat nature of operation, limited size of landing and pick up zones within the area of operations, the requirement to operate in high altitude areas and the increased survivability to both aircrew and troops, clearly indicated that the Blackhawk is the helicopter that should be fielded to Colombia in support of a counter drug effort.  \\n   That was from a U.S. Army report. \\n   Senator DODD and I have offered an amendment that says the U.S. Department of Defense, in consultation with the Colombian military, will determine what kind of helicopters will be most effective to support the purposes for which we are spending this money, which are counternarcotics in Colombia. The Senate ought not to micromanage the decision on which helicopters will be used. It is a decision that ought to be left to those who are the experts. \\n   We cannot pretend this overall emergency aid package is a perfect solution to all the problems confronting Colombia or any of the other countries in the region. Neither is this assistance a panacea to the problems of drug abuse and addiction in the United States. It is a strong and credible step forward. \\n   For these reasons, I support the underlying package, oppose the Gorton amendment, and proudly support and cosponsor the Dodd amendment. \\n   I thank the Chair and yield the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-20000620\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to oppose this amendment to create a Commission on Cuba. I do so with some personal reluctance because of my deep affection and respect for my colleague from Connecticut who is the sponsor of the amendment and who I know is acting with the best of intentions. We simply have come to a different conclusion on this question. \\n   Some might say: What can be the harm of a commission to study Cuban-American relations? I oppose the idea of a commission because I believe the current state of America\\'s policy toward Cuba is right. \\n   It has been sustained now over four decades. It began and has continued as  a bipartisan policy which originates from Castro\\'s Communist takeover of that country in 1959, and his attempts to spread communism to other parts of this hemisphere and to the world. \\n   Although I think our policy has helped prevent Castro\\'s communism from expanding to the Americas, thanks to the strong leadership of ourselves and other countries, his regime continues to subject the Cuban people to a form of government that deprives them of their basic and inalienable human rights. He is now one of the last of less than a handful of old-style Communist leaders, and his regime\\'s human rights record remains abysmal. \\n   Throughout my years in the Senate, I have been a strong supporter of our policy toward Cuba, and I remain a strong supporter because I believe it is right. It is based on principle, and Castro has done nothing to justify a change in that policy. In fact, every time we give him an opportunity to show he has changed, he refuses to take that opportunity. \\n   I quote from the State Department\\'s most recent Annual Human Rights Report for Cuba, issued in 1999:  \\n   Cuba is a totalitarian state controlled by President Fidel Castro..*.*.*.The Government continued to control all significant means of production and remained the predominant employer..*.*.*.The Government\\'s human rights record remained poor. It continued systematically to violate the civil and political rights of its citizens..*.*.*.The authorities routinely continued to harass, threaten, arbitrarily arrest, detain, imprison, and defame human rights advocates and members of independent professional associations, including journalists, economists, doctors, and lawyers, often with the goal of coercing them into leaving the country..*.*.*.The Government denied citizens the freedom of speech, press, assembly, and association..*.*.*.The Government denied political dissidents and human rights advocates due process and subjected them to unfair trials.  \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-2-20000620\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, this regime has done nothing to justify a change in our policy toward it. For that reason, I will vote against this amendment. I thank the Chair and yield the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-20000620\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss provisions (Section 906) in the FY 2001 National Defense Authorization Act (S. 2549) aimed at supporting efforts within the Department of Defense to develop a set of operational concepts, sometimes referred to as ``Network Centric Warfare,\\'\\' that seek to exploit the power of information and US superiority in information technologies to maintain dominance and improve interoperability on the battlefield. I am very pleased to have been joined in the development of these provisions by my able colleagues, Senators ROBERTS and BINGAMAN. This concept of operations generates increased combat power by networking sensors, decision makers and shooters to achieve shared situational awareness, increased speed of command, higher tempo of synchronized operations, greater lethality, increased survivability, and more efficient support operations. In the words of Vice Admiral Arthur Cebrowski, the President of the Naval War College, ``Network Centric Warfare is an embodiment of the emerging theory of warfare for the Information Age.\\'\\' \\n   As we strive to transform our military to meet the challenges and threats of the new century, it is clear that we must make better use of our huge advantages in information technology, sensors, networks, and computing to achieve battlefield dominance. Network Centric Warfare exploits these advantages not only by identifying, developing, and utilizing the best new networking and sensing technologies, but also by adjusting our existing doctrine, tactics, training and even acquisition, planning, and programming to reflect the network centric concepts of operations. A truly networked force can be lighter, faster, more precise, more Joint and more able to respond to contingencies ranging from peacekeeping to major regional conflicts.  \\n   In Joint Vision 2020, the Joint Chiefs of Staff highlight the critical role that information and information systems will play in future operations, stating:  \\n   *.*.* the ongoing ``information revolution\\'\\' is creating not only a quantitative, but a qualitative change in the information environment that by 2020 will result in profound changes in the conduct of military operations. In fact, advances in information capabilities are proceeding so rapidly that there is a risk of outstripping our ability to capture ideas, formulate operational concepts, and develop the capacity to assess results. While the goal of achieving information superiority will not change, the nature, scope, and ``rules\\'\\' of the quest are changing radically. \\n   Information superiority provides the joint force a competitive advantage only when it is effectively translated into superior knowledge and decisions. The joint force must be able to take advantage of superior information converted to superior knowledge to achieve ``decision superiority\\'\\'--better decisions arrived at and implemented faster than an opponent can react, or in a noncombat situation, at a tempo that allows the force to shape the situation or react to changes and accomplish its mission. Decision superiority does not automatically result from information superiority. Organizational and doctrinal adaptation, relevant training and experience, and the proper command and control mechanisms and tools are equally necessary.  \\n   The legislation in Section 906 of S. 2549 explores many of the facets of this Joint vision of a networked force and operations. \\n   It is clear that there have been chronic difficulties and deficiencies in our recent military operations, including Kosovo, associated with Service-centric boundaries and segmentation of operational areas by Service, which have resulted in a number of interoperability failures and inefficiencies. Reports have suggested that we continue to have difficulty collecting, processing, and disseminating critical information to our battlefields. These shortfalls, for example, severely limited our ability to make full use of the capabilities of our JSTARS aircraft or to effectively strike mobile targets. Earlier in this session, the Armed Services Committee received testimony concerning Kosovo operations from Lieutenant General Michael Short, the Commander of Allied Air Forces in Southern Europe, where he highlighted improvements made within the Air Force to move targeting information from intelligence assets (for example, U-2s) to some combat aircraft. But he also pointed out the need to expand these efforts,  \\n   *.*.* we need to be able to do that across the fleet, to move information to A-10s and F-16s and F/A-18s and F-14s, everything we have got, *.*.* to rapidly respond to the emerging situation.  \\n   It is also clear that these problems do not all stem from technological deficiencies. In fact, many of the interoperability difficulties that we see today result from force and organizational structures, doctrine, and tactics that have not kept pace with technological change. Admiral James Ellis, the Commander-in-Chief of Allied Forces in Southern Europe, highlighted these problems for the Committee, stating about the Kosovo operation,  \\n   There are clearly opportunities for us to, through firewalls and the like, to pass data, *.*.* that we were not able to during this effort that require attention as well, so that at a staff level as well as at a planning and execution level we have the ability to communicate as freely as we need to in order to ensure that we\\'ve got the security and the capability that the alliance is capable of delivering.  \\n   The networking of our military assets and the training of our personnel and transformation of our forces to adapt to an information-centric environment will be critical for future military operations. Theater Missile Defense is an excellent example of the need for this type of network centric approach. Given the global proliferation of missile technology and weapons of mass destruction, we are moving toward a robust missile defense capability to protect our warfighters deployed overseas. The Theater Missile Defense mission depends on the seamless linking of multiple Joint assets and on the timely passing of critical information between sensors and shooters. Earlier this year, Lieutenant General Ron Kadish testified that we have got ``some long work ahead\\'\\' to make our various Theater Missile Defense efforts interoperable. We must all work to ensure that we develop the space-based and airborne sensing systems, interoperable networking and communications systems, and Joint operations and organizations needed to perform this vital mission. \\n   After extensive discussions with a variety of Agency and Service officials, I believe that although there are many innovative efforts underway throughout the Department to develop network centric technologies and systems, as well as to establish mechanisms to integrate information systems, sensors, weapon systems and decision makers, these efforts are too often underfunded, low-priority, and not coordinated across Services. In many cases, they will \\n   unfortunately continue the legacy of interoperability problems that we all know exist today. To paraphrase one senior Air Force officer, we are not making the necessary fundamental changes--we are still nibbling at the edges. \\n   The legislation incorporated into the Defense bill calls for DoD to provide three reports to Congress detailing efforts in moving towards Network Centric forces and operations. \\n   Section 906(b) calls for a report focusing on the broad development and implementation of Network Centric Warfare concepts in the Department of Defense. The Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff are asked to report on their current and planned efforts to coordinate all DoD activities in Network Centric Warfare to show how they are moving toward a truly Joint, networked force. The report calls for the development of a set of metrics as discussed in Section 906(b)(2)(C) to be used to monitor our progress towards a Joint, network centric force and the attainment of fully integrated Joint command and control capabilities, both in technology and organizational structure. These metrics will then be used in more detailed case studies described in Section 906(b)(2)(E)--focusing on Service interoperability and fratricide reduction. \\n   The legislation also requires the Department to report on how it is moving towards Joint Requirements and Acquisition policies and increasing Joint authority in this area to ensure that future forces will be truly seamless, interoperable, and network-centric, as described in Sections 906(b)(2) (F) through (I). Many view these Joint activities as being critically necessary to achieving networked systems and operations. Unless we move away from a system designed to protect individual Service interests and procurement programs, we will always be faced with solving interoperability problems between systems. For example, strengthening the Joint oversight of the requirements for and acquisition of all systems directly involved in Joint Task Forces interoperability would provide a sounder method for acquiring these systems. We need to move away from a Cold War based, platform-centric acquisition system that is slow, cumbersome, and Service-centric. As part of this review, we ask DoD to examine the speed at which it can acquire new technologies and whether the personnel making key decisions on information systems procurement are technically trained or at least supported by the finest technical talent available. We also need to ensure that Service acquisition systems are responsive to the establishment of Joint interoperability standards in networking, computing, and communications, as well as best commercial practices. \\n   In the operations support area, DoD can follow the example of the private sector--which has embraced network centric operations to improve efficiency in an increasingly competitive environment. Companies as different as IBM and WalMart are both moving to streamline and unify their networks and to make their distribution, inventory control and personnel management systems more modern and information-centric. Successful firms are not only buying the newest technology, they are also changing their operations and business plans to deal with the new networked environments. Section 906(b)(2)(J) calls for the Department to study private sector efforts in these areas and evaluate their past successes and failures as they can inform future DoD activities. \\n   Section 906(c) describes the second report, which examines the use of the Joint Experimentation Program in developing Network Centric Warfare concepts. Network Centric Warfare is inherently Joint, and the Commander in  Chief of Joint Forces Command is in the best position to develop new operational concepts and test the new technologies that support it. The report calls for a description of how the Joint Experimentation Program and the results of its activities are to be used to develop new Joint Requirements, Doctrine, and Acquisition programs to support network centric operations. It also requires the development and description of a plan to use the Joint Experimentation program to identify impediments to the development of a joint information network, including the linking of Service intranets, as well as redesigning force structures to leverage new network centric operational concepts. \\n   The final report, described in Section 906(d), focuses on the coordination of Service and Agency Science and Technology investments in the development of future Joint Network Centric Warfare capabilities. In moving towards a more Joint, networked force we must continue to ensure that we provide our nation\\'s warfighters with the best technologies. We must increase our investments in areas such as sensors, networking protocols, human-machine interfaces, training, and other technologies outlined in Section 906(d)(2)(A), especially in the face of declining S&T budgets. The report requires the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics to explain how S&T investments supporting network centric operations will be coordinated across the Agencies and Services to eliminate redundancy and better address critical warfighter, technology, and R&D needs. This is more important than ever as we develop our next generation of weapon systems--better coordination and establishment of common standards in the technology development stages can only help to alleviate future interoperability problems. \\n   The Undersecretary\\'s planning and evaluation of investments in S&T for a network centric force must also address the role of the operator in a network centric system. We must pay more attention to the training of our combat and support personnel so that they can make the best use of information technologies, as well as investing more in research on learning and cognitive processes so that our training systems and human-machine interfaces are optimized. \\n   The investments recommended in the report should also accommodate the incredible pace of change in information technologies that is currently driven by the commercial sector. To address this, Section 906(d)(2)(B) calls for an analysis of how commercially driven revolutions in information technology are modifying the DoD\\'s investment strategy and incorporation of dual-use technologies. \\n   I believe this legislation will help focus the Pentagon and Congress\\' attention on the need to move our military into a more information savvy and networked force. I hope that these three key reports set forth the needed organizational, policy, and legislative changes necessary to achieve this transformation for decision makers in the military, Administration, and in Congress. I believe that our future military operations must be network centric to preserve our technological and operational superiority. I look forward to receiving plans and proposals to help get us there efficiently and effectively. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-20000620\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep concern about the recent arrest in Russia of Vladimir Gusinsky and its negative impact on press freedom and democracy under the leadership of President Putin. \\n   Mr. Gusinsky runs Media Most, a major conglomerate of Russian media organizations, including NTV, Russia\\'s only television network not under state control. Media Most is a relatively independent force in Russian news reporting, and its outlets have offered hard-hitting, often critical accounts of Russia\\'s brutal campaign in  Chechnya, as well as reports on alleged Government corruption. Besides being an important media and business executive, Mr. Gusinsky is a also a leading figure in the Russian Jewish community, serving as President of the Russian Jewish Congress. \\n   On May 11, just days after President Putin\\'s inauguration, Russian federal agents in a major show of force raided several of Media Most\\'s corporate offices, raising immediate concerns about the direction of press freedom in the new government. These concerns intensified on Tuesday June 13 when a Russian prosecutor called Mr. Gusinsky in for questioning, and then arrested him on suspicion of embezzling millions of dollars worth of federal property. On June 16, Mr. Gusinsky was released from prison after the prosecutor formally charged him with embezzlement. \\n   It is very difficult for anyone to address fully the specifics of such charges, and the Russian government\\'s case against Mr. Gusinsky, when so little information has been made available by the Russian government. However, the circumstances of the case raise serious concerns about the initial direction of press freedom and democracy under President Putin. As one of the opening acts of the new Administration, the government chose to carry out a heavy-handed, much publicized raid on an organization led by high profile Government critic. It chose to arrest the leader of an organization, Media Most, that is one of the few outlets of independent news about controversial Russian government policies. The fact that this arrest took place while President Putin was traveling abroad, and that he publicly speculated that the arrest might have been excessive, serves to make the situation and the Government\\'s policy even more confusing and unsettling. Moreover, this case in not occurring in a vacuum. After President Putin\\'s election, but before his inauguration, there were disturbing signs of government hostility toward Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, evident in the harassment of RFE/RL correspondent Andrei Babitsky. \\n   I am encouraged to see that prominent Russians have been speaking out about the arrest of Mr. Gusinsky, and that our Government is signaling its concern too. I echo the New York Times editorial on June 15 that this is ``A Chilling Prosecution in Moscow.\\'\\' I would ask unanimous consent that this piece, as well as similar editorials from the June 15 editions of the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal, be printed in full in the RECORD. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-20000619\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I want to thank Chairman WARNER and Ranking Member LEVIN for their foresight in accepting the amended text of S. 1993, the Government Information Security Act, which was unanimously reported out of the Government Affairs Committee. \\n   We are now far enough into the digital age to understand both its promise and its pitfalls. Our booming economy is driven in large part by the dot.com entrepreneurs who are providing goods and services faster and more cost-effectively than ever before in our history. But we are also experiencing threats to our privacy, to the integrity of our digitized information, and even to our ability to use our computers freely. \\n   We know there will be trade-offs for the benefits government will reap in the digital age. But, I offer this sincere warning now: information security cannot be one of them. With this amendment, we would lay the groundwork for securing much of the government\\'s electronic information. Above all else, protecting the integrity, the availability and the confidentiality of information stored on federal computers is central to serving taxpayers in the digital age. And we must be vigilant about it. \\n   Like the rest of the nation, the government is ever more dependent on automated information systems to store information and perform tasks. At hearings before the Government Affairs Committee last Congress, however, witnesses testified that such increased reliance has not been met by an equivalent strengthening of the security of those systems. It is chilling to think of less than perfect security in the context, for example, of tax and wage information the Internet Revenue Service maintains, troop movements monitored by the Defense Department, or public health threats analyzed by the Centers of Disease Control. Without proper security, government\\'s dependence on computers would expose to exploitation all of this information--and much more. \\n   Indeed, some of this information may be in jeopardy right now. A series of General Accounting Office (GAO) studies found government computer security so lax that GAO put the entire apparatus on its list of ``high risk\\'\\' government programs. GAO reported in September 1998 that inadequate controls over information systems at the Veterans Administration exposed many of its service delivery and management systems to disruption or misuse. In May 1998, the GAO gained unauthorized access to State Department networks, enabling the GAO, had it tried, to modify, delete or download data and shut down services. In May 1999, GAO reported that one of its test teams gained access to mission critical computer systems at NASA, which would have allowed the team to control spacecraft or alter scientific data returned from space. \\n   Our problem is not simply a technical one. It is also a cultural one. The federal government can purchase and implement the most advanced security programs it can afford but unless top government officials acknowledge that our future depends on information security, those programs will be meaningless. But even high-level attention to and responsibility for \\n   security will mean little unless everyone and anyone who uses a computer--which, these days, must include practically every government worker--does their part to ensure the security of the system on which they work. This amendment, therefore, focuses on good management practices to ensure secure government information systems. \\n   Had this amendment been in place earlier this year when the ``Love Bug\\'\\' and successive, mutating viruses wreaked havoc on the world\\'s computers, government would have been better prepared to withstand the attack. I hope that government employees would have been more aware of the need to upgrade their systems\\' security software to ensure that such ``worms,\\'\\' as they are called, were barred from the system. And this amendment\\'s training provisions would have helped to ensure that employees were versed in the dangers of opening attachments from unknown senders. \\n   The cornerstone of this amendment is the plan each agency must develop to protect sensitive federal information systems. Agency chief information officers (CIOs) would be responsible for developing and implementing the security programs, which must undergo annual evaluations and be subject to the approval of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). \\n   Because we need to change our cultural attitudes toward information security, the OMB also would be responsible for establishing government-wide policies promoting security as a central part of each agency\\'s operation. And we intend to hold agency heads accountable for implementing those policies. This amendment requires high-level accountability for the management of agency systems beginning with the Director of OMB and agency heads. Each agency\\'s plan must reflect an understanding that computer security is an integral part of the development process for any new system. Agencies now tend to develop a system and consider security issues only as the system is about to go online. \\n   This amendment establishes an ongoing, periodic reporting, testing and evaluation process to gauge the effectiveness of agencies\\' policies and procedures. This would be accomplished through reviews of agency budgets, program performance and financial management. And the amendment requires an independent, annual evaluation of all information security practices and programs to be conducted by the agency\\'s Inspector General, GAO or an independent external auditor. I hope that the IGs will use their limited resources wisely and use their discretion in targeting those areas of their agencies\\' programs which require the most attention. In addition, I hope that agency heads will work with their IGs, especially when it comes to sharing information on potential threats to agencies\\' systems. \\n   Our amendment requires that agencies report unauthorized intrusions into government systems. GSA currently has a program for reporting and responding to such incidents. The amendment requires agencies to use this reporting and monitoring system. \\n   The amendment requires that the national security and classified systems adhere to the same management structure as every other government system under our bill. This means they must develop a plan addressing security upgrades, although the plan need not be approved by \\n   OMB. To address particular concerns raised by the defense and intelligence communities, the amendment allows the heads of agencies with national security and classified systems to designate their own independent evaluators in the interest of protecting sensitive information and system vulnerabilities. And the Secretary of Defense, the Director of Central Intelligence, and other agency heads, as designated by the President, may develop their own procedures for  detecting, reporting and responding to security incidents. \\n   Finally, President Clinton has proposed a very creative idea known as the Federal Cyber Service designed to strengthen the government\\'s cadre of information security professionals. Our amendment authorizes this program and gives agencies the flexibility they need to implement it. The program includes scholarships in exchange for government service, retraining computer information specialists and, as part of our campaign to influence cultural behavior, proposals to promote cyber-security awareness among Federal workers and high school and secondary school students. \\n   Since Senator THOMPSON and I introduced S. 1993 last November, we have worked closely with the Administration, the Department of Defense, the National Security Agency, the Department of Energy, the CIO Council, the Inspector General community, and interested parties outside government. We have made changes to address the concerns that have been raised and I am very pleased that the administration strongly supports the provisions. \\n   Witnesses testifying at the Governmental Affairs Committee hearing on S. 1993 were also very supportive of the bill. Jack Brock, Director of GAO\\'s Governmentwide and Defense Information Systems Group in the Accounting and Information Management Division testified that ``the bill, in fact, incorporates the basic tenets of good security management found in our report on security practices of leading organizations. ..... \\'\\' He also said that ``the key to this process is recognizing that information security is not a technical matter of locking down systems, but rather a management problem....... Thus, it is highly appropriate that S. 1993 requires a risk management approach that incorporates these elements.\\'\\' \\n   Roberta Gross, the Inspector General at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration testified that ``..... S. 1993 is a very positive step in highlighting the importance of centralized oversight and coordination in responding to risks and threats to IT [information technology] security.\\'\\' S. 1993 ``..... importantly recognizes that IT security is one of the most important issues in shaping future Federal planning and investment ..... the Act makes it clear that each agency must be far more vigilant and involved than current practices.\\'\\' \\n   Another witness, James Adams, Chief Executive Officer of Defense, a security consulting firm, testified that S. 1993 is ``..... thoughtful and badly needed legislation .....\\'\\' which ``..... takes a crucial step forward.\\'\\' Ken Watson of Cisco Systems noted hat S. 1993 is consistent with what industry has already been encouraging, that is that ``..... security must be promoted as an integral component of each agency\\'s business operations, and information technology security training is essential. .....\\'\\' \\n   Mr. President, it is my hope that, if enacted, this amendment will improve our computer security to the point where the operations of government in the digital age are performed with the privacy and well-being of the American public in mind. Again, I am pleased the leadership of the Armed Services Committee has accepted this amendment because, in the digital age, there is no such thing as moving too quickly. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-20000616\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.  \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-2-20000616\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the amendment Senator KENNEDY will offer on Monday, of which I am pleased to be a cosponsor. \\n   One of the things we try to do in this Chamber, as lawmakers, is to adopt laws that express and encode our values as a society, to, in some sense, put into law our aspirations for the kind of people we want to be. \\n   Clearly, one of the bedrock values, one of the fundamental values, of America is equality--equality of treatment before the law, equality of opportunity but, beyond that, a broader notion of tolerance in our society. It is part of what brought generations of immigrants to this country--the idea that they would be judged on their personal merit, not on anything related to their personal status or characteristics. \\n   Tolerance has been a hallmark of American society. I said before, when I talked about the law, that law sometimes tries to express the aspirations we have for ourselves. Sometimes, obviously, we do not achieve those aspirations and we are intolerant toward one another. Then the law has not only the opportunity but the obligation to step in and to try to create incentives or deterrence toward the worst forms of intolerance, even hatred. That is what this amendment is about. \\n   Clearly, over the decades our Nation has built a strong and proud history of protecting the civil rights of Americans who are subject to racial, religious, gender-based, or disability-based discrimination in the workplace, in housing, in life. \\n   In more recent times, there are a group of us here in the Chamber who have worked to try to extend some of those protections to cover bias, discrimination based on sexual orientation. \\n   It seems to me this amendment and the law on which it builds are also right and proper because they take Federal criminal jurisdiction and extend it to the prosecution and punishment of those who are accused of having caused bodily injury or death based on an animus, a personal animus, a hatred that comes from feelings about the victim\\'s race, religion, nationality, gender, disability, or sexual orientation. In other words, this is another way for our society to express our disdain, to put it mildly, at acts of violence committed based on a person\\'s race, religion, nationality, gender, disability, or sexual orientation. \\n   It is also a way, as is traditionally the province of criminal law, not just to speak to the common moral consensus of our society about what is right and what is wrong because that is what the law is all about, but hopefully by pushing those who are proven to have committed the wrongs, to deter others in the future from committing those same acts that society generally finds abhorrent. \\n   Current law expresses this but in a way that is limited. It permits Federal prosecutions of hate crimes resulting from death or bodily injury if two conditions are met: First, the crime must be motivated by the victim\\'s race, religion, national origin, or color; second, the perpetrator must have intended to prevent the victim from exercising a federally protected right such as voting or traveling interstate. Of course, I support this law and the goals that it embraces: The Federal prosecution of people who inflict serious harm on others because of the color of the victim\\'s skin, the sound of the victim\\'s voice, a foreign accent, or the particular place in which the victim worships God. In short, these are crimes committed because the victim is different in some way from the perpetrator. Such crimes, I conclude, should be federally prosecuted. \\n   As we have had U.S. attorneys invoking these laws, carrying them out, we have discovered some shortcomings and some ways in which we can make them better, which is to say, ways in which we can more fully express some of the principles I talked about at the outset: equality, tolerance, doing everything we can to stop the most abhorrent acts of violence against people based on their characteristics. I think we ought to add to the list of prohibited bases of these crimes, crimes committed against someone because of gender, because of sexual orientation, and because of disability. That is what is provided in the amendment the senior Senator from Massachusetts will offer on Monday and of which I am proud to be a cosponsor. \\n   I suppose some people may hear these categories that I have mentioned and say: People commit crimes based on that basis? The fact is, they do. Sometimes they become quite visible and notorious. Crimes such as that committed against Matthew Shepard, who was killed because he was a gay man, are no less despicable and, of course, therefore no less deserving of Federal protection and prosecution than are those committed against others based on a characteristic, a status of the person, that are currently included in the Federal law. Adding these categories--gender, sexual orientation, disability--seems to me to be an appropriate extension of the basic concept of equal protection under the law. As the law now stands, it also imposes a requirement, a bar to prosecution relating to race, color, religion, and national origin that we ought to change, which is that the law is only triggered if the victim is prevented from exercising a specifically enumerated federally protected activity. \\n   There are obviously crimes that are committed based on hatred that are triggered in cases other than the simple prevention of the exercise of a federally protected activity, thus, the provision of this amendment that would eliminate this obstacle and, therefore, broaden the ability of Federal prosecutors to pursue crimes motivated by racial or religious hatred. \\n   The amendment that will be introduced on Monday also includes new language requiring the Justice Department, prior to \\n   indicting a defendant in a hate crime based on the categories I have enumerated, including those added under this amendment, a prosecutor of the Justice Department will have to, prior to the indictment, certify either that the State is not going to prosecute a hate crime, therefore avoiding both an overlap and the opportunity for prosecution by those in law enforcement closest to the crime, the alleged crime, and will also have to certify that the State requested or does not object to Justice Department prosecution or that the State has completed prosecution. It seems that you wouldn\\'t have to say that, but just to be sure to avoid a kind of double exposure, double prosecution, that certification should satisfy the concerns some of my colleagues may have who may fear that Federal prosecutors will interfere with State efforts to bring perpetrators of hate crimes to justice. In other words, the State is given the first opportunity and the superior opportunity to prosecute these cases. Only if the State does not will Federal prosecutors be able to proceed. \\n   At a time when so much else is going on here in the Capitol with the high profile issues of this session--the Patients\\' Bill of Rights, whether we are going to give Medicare coverage or other coverage for prescription drug benefits for seniors, campaign finance reform--this amendment brings us back to America\\'s first principles of equality and tolerance and challenges each of us to think about the appropriate and constructive role that the law can play, understanding that the law can\\'t control the hearts of people in this country. \\n   Ultimately, we have to count on people\\'s own sense of judgment and tolerance and, hopefully, the effect that other forces in their lives will have on them to make them fair and tolerant, such as their families, their schools, their religions, their faith. But here is the law to say in the cases when all of those other sources of good judgment and values in society fail to stifle the hatred that sometimes does live in people\\'s hearts and souls, to say that this is unacceptable in America and to attach to that statement the sanction of law, hoping that we thereby express the higher aspirations we have for this great country of ours as it continues over the generations to try to realize the noble ideals expressed by our founders in the Declaration and the Constitution, but also to put clearly into the force of law the punishment that comes with law when one goes so far over the line to commit an act of violence based on hatred, hoping thereby that we will deter such heinous acts from occurring again in the future.  \\n   I hope my colleagues over the weekend will have a chance to take a look at this amendment, will come to the floor and talk about it, and perhaps question those of us who have proposed it. Then I hope a strong bipartisan majority will support it when it comes to a vote next Tuesday. \\n   I thank the distinguished Chair. I yield the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-20000615\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concern about a rider that has been attached to the Transportation Appropriations bill in Congress for the past four years. The language of this rider prevents the Administration from even considering an increase to our nation\\'s Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE. This rider was a bad idea when it was first introduced four years ago, and it is a bad idea today. This rider appears yet again in the FY2001 House Transportation Appropriations bill. I would like to voice my opposition to this rider and express my support for Senator GORTON\\'s Motion to Instruct Conferees, which he is offering with Senators FEINSTEIN and BRYAN, that opposes the CAFE freeze. \\n   Aside from my personal conviction about the importance of improved CAFE standards, I am troubled by this provision for another fundamental reason: this rider bars the Administration from considering--even discussing--making our cars more efficient. This Administration should be making decisions in light of all possible information, not being asked to forgo critical policy analyses simply because they are not allowed to freely evaluate different options. \\n   Substantively, this rider forces the nation to bypass a critical opportunity to make our fleet of cars more efficient. The efficiency of our cars, or said another way, the number of miles our cars can travel on one gallon of gasoline, is important for a great number of reasons. First, because of recent and continuing increases in the price of fuel, we have felt firsthand the bite of high prices at the pump. The best answer to reducing the amount of money we spend each month on gasoline is to make our cars more efficient. We know this approach will work, because the doubling of fuel economy between 1975 and the mid 1980s saved new car purchasers an average of $3,000 in fuel over the lifetime of the car, at today\\'s prices. The Union of Concerned Scientists estimates, for example, that if we were to raise light truck fuel economy to 27.5 miles per gallon, the most popular Sports Utility Vehicle in the country--the Ford Explorer--would go from traveling 19 miles to the gallon to traveling 34 miles to the gallon. We could achieve this for $935 in established technology, and the SUV owner would save thousands of dollars over the lifetime of the car. \\n   Second, we need to raise CAFE standards for the sake of our national security. The United States imports more than half of its oil from foreign countries, and this dangerously limits our independence and potentially our options in times of turmoil. The dramatic rise in oil prices in recent months should be a reminder of how overly-dependent we are on OPEC, and how vulnerable we are to OPEC cartel pricing. We must raise our domestic fuel economy in order to reduce this dependence. According to the Sierra Club, raising CAFE standards would save more oil than we import from the Persian Gulf and off-shore California drilling combined. \\n   Third, there are critical environmental gains to be made from improving the fuel economy of our vehicles. There have been a number of reports in recent weeks about the reality of global warming. A Federal Government study released earlier this week, requested by Congress four years ago, reports that global climate has become approximately one degree hotter over the past century, and many scientists believe that this warming trend will continue as humans continue to burn fossil fuels. This trend will cause very real and significant changes to our weather and climate patterns, fundamentally altering the way of life in some geographic areas. A recent study at NASA\\'s Ames Research Center reported that the ozone layer is not recovering as fast as was previously thought, potentially due to greenhouse gas emissions. A report by Environment Canada and Parks Canada shows that some national park glaciers could disappear in 20 years due to global warming. These and other significant reports come on the heels of one another to warn us that global warming is real and that we need to pay serious attention to the problem. \\n   The first, very important step we must take to curb greenhouse gas emissions is to reduce the amount of fossil fuels we consume in our vehicles. Improving the CAFE standards to 45 mpg for cars and 34 mpg for light trucks would save this country 3 million barrels of oil per day and prevent  hundreds of millions of tons of CO  \\n   2 from entering the atmosphere every year. Carbon dioxide is the major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and to the subsequent warming of our climate. We must, I repeat we must, take this step and raise CAFE standards. \\n   Since the 1980s, partly due to our nation\\'s increasing use of light trucks, or Sports Utility Vehicles, the corporate average fuel economy of our fleet of vehicles has declined. According to EPA\\'s 1999 Report on Fuel Economy Standards, there have been no improvements in fuel economy for light trucks in 19 years. This is particularly dismaying when we consider that over half the passenger vehicles sold in the U.S. now fit into the category of light trucks. We know we can do better and that the technology already exists. Using state of the art engine refinements; optimized transmission control; high strength, ``ultra-light\\'\\' steel techniques, and lower rolling resistance tires, auto manufacturers should be able to improve fuel economy drastically. \\n   For all these reasons, we must move back toward improving the fuel economy of the vehicles in the United States. It saddens me that some of my colleagues would like to prevent this discussion from even taking place. The first step in the right direction is to uphold the Gorton/Feinstein/Bryan motion and oppose the freeze on CAFE standards. From there, we will be able to discuss appropriate measures to improve upon our vehicles, for so many reasons that make good sense. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-20000614\\n\\n    Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I submit for the RECORD the following, written by Marshall H. Cohen, photojournalist, and honorary life-member of the Association of Tall Ship, The Danmark, June, 2000.  \\n   Captain Vilhelm Hansen passed away at age 82 on May 3, 2000. Captain Hansen was master of the training ship the Danmark for twenty-two years from 1964 until his retirement in 1986. He was not only a legendary captain and educator, training thousands of Danish men and women for maritime careers, but also a familiar, and well-liked ambassador of good will to the United States with his ready wit, his unparalleled knowledge of seamanship, and his unbending strong character. Whenever the Danmark anchored in various East Coast ports, thousands of Americans, including members of the U.S. Congress, have been welcomed on board this beautiful full-rigged ship. \\n   Captain Hansen received many honors and awards here in the United States. He has been presented with the keys to many U.S. cities, among them, Baltimore. He received the Danish-American Society\\'s ``Man of the Year\\'\\' award in New York City in 1987, and this year (June 8, 2000) Captain Hansen posthumously received the National Maritime Historical Society Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Maritime Education in a ceremony in Miami, Florida. \\n   The Danmark has played a significant role in the maritime history of the United States. In 1939, the Danmark was on a routine training mission to the United States when the Second World War began. The Captain at that time, Knud Hansen, was informed that Germany had invaded Denmark, and consequently, the Danmark remained in the United States for the duration of the war. The Danmark was based in New London, Connecticut, and served as a training ship for U.S. sailors. \\n   The First Officer of the Danmark during the war was Knud Langevad, and he was in charge of training more than 5,000 U.S. cadets. He also convinced U.S. authorities of the value of learning basic seamanship on a tall ship, and following the war the U.S. Coast Guard purchased its well-known tall ship the U.S. Eagle, to replace the Danmark. \\n   Reflecting this special kinship between the two ships, the Danmark sails as the first foreign ship behind the Eagle in official Tall Ship Parades. It will be so honored again in June and July, 2000 during the millennium voyage of tall ships along the East Coast, from Miami to Boston. \\n   On July 4, 1986 the Danmark was honored with the number two position sailing behind the Eagle during the Parade of Tall Ships celebrating the 100th birthday of the Statue of Liberty. It was Captain Hansen\\'s final voyage as master of the Danmark prior to his retirement that year. Captain Vilhelm Hansen, in his white uniform and gold braided cap, steered his 253 foot ship into the South Street Seaport, New York City, for the last time. He barked his final commands to the officers, switched off the auxiliary engine, and ended his distinguished career during this memorable event in American history.  \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-20000608\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks concerning an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act (S. 2549) that would establish a commission to assess the future of the United States aerospace industry and to make recommendations for actions by the Federal Government to improve this industries global competitiveness. \\n   The modern aerospace industry fulfills vital roles for our nation. It is a pillar of the business community that employs 800,000 skilled workers. It is an engine of economic growth that generated a net trade surplus of $37 billion in 1998, larger than any other industrial sector. It is a working model of private-public partnership, yielding commercial and military benefits that have enhanced our communication and transportation networks while enabling the aerospace dominance demonstrated in both Kosovo and the Gulf War. And its well-known products, from the Boeing 777 to the Blackhawk helicopter to the Space Shuttle, serve as fitting symbols of American preeminence in an inter-connected world that thrives on speed and technology. \\n   Unfortunately, this key industrial sector is facing new challenges to its leadership role in the global economy. Since 1985, foreign competition has cut the American share of the worldwide aerospace market from 72 percent to 56 percent. In order to remain competitive, we must reevaluate industrial regulations enacted during the Cold War, that might hamper innovation, flexibility, and growth. We must reconsider our defense research priorities, to counteract the 50% decline in domestic funding for aerospace research and development during the last decade. We must reexamine the rules that govern export of aerospace products and technologies, and develop policies that permit access to global markets while protecting national security. we must assess all of these areas in light of new trade agreements that may require adjustments to federal regulations and policies. Ultimately, we must assess the future of the aerospace industry and ensure that government policy plays a positive role in its development. \\n   To accomplish this goal, this amendment calls for the creation of a Presidential commission empowered to recommend action to the federal government regarding the future of the aerospace industry. The commission shall be composed of experts in aerospace manufacturing, national security, and related economic issues, as well as representatives of organized labor. The commission is directed to study economic and national security issues confronting the aerospace industry, such as the state of government funding for aerospace research and procurement, the rules governing exportation of aerospace goods and technologies, the effect of current taxation and trade policies on the aerospace industry, and the adequacy of aerospace science and engineering education in institutions of higher learning. I urge the Congress to support the creation of the Commission and the next President to support its activities and heed its counsel. By creating such a commission and through careful consideration of these complex issues, we can ensure that this valuable American industry soars into the 21st century, turbulence-free. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-2-20000608\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair and my friend from Wisconsin. I ask unanimous consent that Senator FEINSTEIN of California be added as a cosponsor of the amendment. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-3-20000608\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, we have watched the steady deterioration of the vitality of our democracy under assault not from the kinds of foreign enemies that the Department of Defense authorization bill is aimed at protecting us against, but in some senses, an assault from ourselves. We have allowed our political system--particularly the post-Watergate reforms that were adopted to put limits on how much people could give to campaigns, to require full disclosure of those contributions--to be evaded, eroded, made a mockery of. The result is that the people of this country rightly conclude that money buys access and influence and affects our Government, and it turns millions of them off from the process. \\n   The vitality of this democracy, which is the pulsating virtue and the essence of America that generations of our soldiers have fought and died for, is under attack domestically. \\n   The question is whether we will respond, whether we will defend our democracy. We have had terrible controversies here on the floor over this question, focused particularly in recent months and years on the work that the Senators from Arizona and Wisconsin have done--Senators MCCAIN and FEINGOLD--particularly trying to focus in on soft money. The controversies have not produced yet the 60 votes we need to adopt a change. But even in the case of soft money, though it clearly violates the intention of the law, which is to limit contributions, there is disclosure. So that part of the post-Watergate reform is still honored. \\n   Now we have the appearance of these 527s, stealth PACs--spending enormous amounts of money in advertising, buying time for what has become ``Big Brother\\'\\' propaganda over TV to influence voters, without letting them or those who are the targets of those advertisements or the opponents of those for whom they are being placed know who is paying for them, how much are they paying, and where is the money coming from. Is it coming from America? Is it coming from abroad? \\n   So a bipartisan group of us--breaking through the division on party lines that has characterized too much of this debate about campaign finance reform and too much debate here generally--earlier this year, proposed two responses. The amendment before the Senate now is the second of those responses. It simply requires disclosure. It doesn\\'t end the mockery of saying one thing to the Federal Elections Commission and another to the IRS--yes, I am in the business of influencing elections, so I deserve the tax exemption; or, no, I am not, so I don\\'t have to register under the campaign finance \\n   laws. All this amendment does is ask for disclosure. \\n   Where is the money coming from? Who is giving it? Who is running these organizations? Who is coming in to try to influence the sacred right of voting--the franchise that is at the heart of our democracy? I had hoped that this amendment, which is reasonable,  moderate, and only invoking the ideal of the right to know, would not evoke controversy on the floor. \\n   So I am disappointed at the response today and disappointed particularly that it comes from those who apparently support the essence of the amendment. I understand this question of an objection--the so-called blue-slip objection being raised in the House because, technically--though really in a very minimal way, if at all--this may affect revenue. This is about political freedom, about electoral reform, about disclosure to the public. It is hardly at all, if at all, a revenue measure. \\n   I understand the fear that if this amendment passes, it may be objected to in the House, and as my distinguished chairman from Virginia, who I dearly love and respect, said before, it could sink this bill, which I enthusiastically support, to the bottom of the ocean, such that hardly Davy Jones could rescue it. Here is my response to that, respectfully: I hope not. I say that this amendment is so important and gives us such a unique opportunity in the recent history of this body to come together across party lines and to do something in the direction of campaign finance reform that it is worth putting it on the bill. I say, as one of the proponents of this amendment, that if, in fact, the fears expressed here are realized, which is that in the House the bill is blue-slipped, objected to on constitutional grounds that it is a revenue-raising measure and should start in the House, then we can do what has been done with many bills, including the DOD authorization bills, in past years--bring it back here under unanimous consent. Who would object to bringing it back? Take this amendment off, send the bill back, and play the role. \\n   They may continue referring to the metaphor of Davy Jones rescuing the bill, but let\\'s not, on a technical basis, miss the opportunity to take one significant step to defend our democracy against the insidious forces of unlimited, secret cash that are corrupting it and distancing millions of our fellow citizens from the process itself. \\n   Mr. President, how much time remains on the time yielded to me? \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-4-20000608\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. Some may ask why disclosure is so important. Well, the Supreme Court has spoken about the appearance of corruption. Here, there is the profound suspicion of corruption; but without information, we don\\'t even have the ability to know whether there is corruption, let alone to have the appearance of corruption--big money, secret money, perhaps not even American money, raised by elected officials, raised by left-leaning, right-leaning ideological groups, raised by political groups, and trade and economic groups, do nothing but undermine our system. The least that we can ask is for disclosure. \\n   Mr. President, I appeal to my colleagues, let\\'s break the reflex action and let\\'s rise to the moment. Let\\'s do something correct and courageous here. Let\\'s adopt this amendment and agree together, arm in arm, that if the House refuses to take the bill with this amendment on it, we will strip it off and find the next appropriate vehicle, having spoken for this amendment to attach this principle and to advance the health and vitality of our democracy. No less than that is at stake here. \\n   I yield the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-5-20000608\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I will not respond to the description of the Senator from Connecticut. But let me say, if there is a risk, here is a risk that has a remedy. The reason the Senator from Connecticut is prepared to take the risk is the balance of equities involved and the balance of interests involved. \\n   I am so incensed by the proliferation. We are using military terms, quite appropriately, on this campaign finance amendment. I note the House chose to use appropriately a militaristic term--``invasion\\'\\'--when talking about their privileges. \\n   But our democracy is so much under threat from the corrosive spread of money in our system that I think we have a moment of opportunity here to get together to pass this amendment and make the statement; in other words, a procedural vote on this. My dear friend and chairman in the House on this very matter on another bill a week or so ago fell short of passage on a motion to recommit, I believe, by barely 10 votes. \\n   I am not prepared to make a judgment about how the House \\n   will vote on this matter. But I think we have a chance to speak. \\n   I pledge to the Senator from Virginia, the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee, under whose leadership this committee on which I am honored to serve had a very busy and productive year resulting in this bill. I can\\'t imagine that any Member of this Chamber would deny a unanimous consent request. If, in fact, the House saw this as an invasion of their privilege and stopped the Department of Defense authorization bill, we would come back here and take this amendment off, and find another vehicle for it. \\n   I appeal to my chairman just finally on this point. I appreciate very much his statement that he supports the substance of the amendment. If he proceeds on the course of a constitutional objection based on House prerogatives, I appeal to him to find a way to join with us, since we agree on the merits of this amendment, to get a guarantee that the Senate will be able to speak as soon and as clearly as possible on the next available bill to at least require disclosure of contributions and sources of contributions to these 527 stealth PACs. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-20000608\\n\\n    Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I would like to acknowledge and congratulate the recent success of the students of Trumbull High School of Trumbull, Connecticut. \\n   On May 6-8 these students competed in the ``We the People ..... The Citizen and the Constitution\\'\\' national finals in Washington, D.C. This competition, administered by the Center for Civic Education, tests elementary, middle and high school students in their knowledge of the American constitutional government. In the finals, in which Trumbull High School matched wits against 50 other classes from across the country, students acted as constitutional experts and testified before a panel of judges in a congressional hearing. \\n   The Trumbull class was taught by Peter Sullivan and included Rachel Bochinno, Alison Brand, Joanna Bruckman, Melissa Budahazy, Lindsey Cahill, Kelly Chapple, Andrew Conway, Jessica Cotter, Shannon Cusello, Jon Draskovic, Timothy Drummond, Michael Dusiewicz, Kim Ferguson, Kathryn Graf, Juli Griek, Amy Hatzis, Lauren Hellthaler, Christine Jelliffe, Dawn Liscinsky, James Lucia, John Manchisi, Saya Nagori, Ryan O\\'Neill, Julian Ross, Alison Schary, David Schub, Neerali Shah, Lauren Slade, Paul Strelka, Varun Vasudeva, and Robert Ward. \\n   I am pleased to recognize the accomplishments of these outstanding students. The ``We the People .....\\'\\' competition is the largest program testing knowledge of the Constitution in the United States, extending to over 26 million students across the country. Advancing to the national finals represents a significant achievement, and demonstrates an impressive interest in and understanding of the structure and processes of our constitutional government. Trumbull High School and all of Connecticut can take great pride in these students\\' success in a subject that is of fundamental importance to the vitality of our democracy.  \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-20000608\\n\\n    Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senators THOMPSON, LEVIN, DURBIN, VOINOVICH, COLLINS and AKAKA to introduce this legislation, which will help improve the transition from one Presidential Administration to the next by providing training and other assistance. \\n   Each newly elected President has the power to bring into government, with the advice and consent of the Senate, his or her own selection of political appointees to manage key agencies and offices within the Executive Branch. However, new administrations face a series of hurdles they must overcome to accomplish this essential task before they can begin to govern. For example, new administrations often lack critical information about the jobs they must fill. Individuals without prior government experience who are selected for key positions may be unfamiliar with how to work with Congress and the media and may run the risk of missteps early in their tenure. But perhaps most importantly, the process by which these individuals are nominated and confirmed has fallen into increasing disarray in recent years. Knowledgeable observers have warned that it could take until November 2001 before all the senior members of the new Administration are vetted and confirmed, due to factors such as lengthier background checks, burdensome and duplicative financial disclosure forms, and a more contentious Senate confirmation process. \\n   The bill we are introducing today is a first step in responding to these problems. It provides for training and orientation of high-level Presidential appointees, to better prepare them for the challenges of their new positions. It provides for the preparation of a ``transition directory\\'\\' containing essential information about the agency structure and responsibilities these new appointees will face. Our bill directs the Office of Government Ethics to study ways to streamline the current financial disclosure process, while still ensuring disclosure of possible conflicts of interest. \\n   More may need to be done. Several studies are underway to look at how we can further improve the transition process, including the Presidential Appointee Initiative and the Transition to Governing Project. I commend those undertaking these studies and their efforts to provide assistance to the upcoming crop of nominees, and I look forward to recommendations for future action. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-20000607\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. \\n   I rise to support the amendment offered by the Senator from Arizona. I am proud to be a cosponsor of it and to join with him and the Senator from Wisconsin, my friend, and also my colleague from New York. \\n   This is a bold but absolutely necessary step which was initiated by the Senator from Arizona, based on some work a bipartisan group did together earlier in the year to try to respond to this latest threat to the integrity of our Nation\\'s election process, and that is the proliferation of so-called ``stealth\\'\\' PACs operating under section 527 of the Tax Code. \\n   As my colleagues have indicated, these groups exploit a relatively recently discovered loophole in the Tax Code that allows organizations seeking to influence Federal elections to fund those elections with undisclosed and unlimited contributions at the same time as they claim exemption from both Federal taxation and the Federal election laws. \\n   As I say these words, and as I have listened to my colleagues, I wonder about the folks listening to the proceedings on C-SPAN. People must justifiably be scratching their heads or, I hope, standing up in outrage at what is happening within our political system. \\n   I was taught as a student at school long ago about the power of water, the natural force of water, to move and find weakness and then move through that weakness to continue to go forward. The flow of money in our political system today, which is not as natural as the movement of water through nature, seems to follow the same kind of unstoppable movement where it pursues a point of weakness in our legal system and pushes through, to \\n   the detriment of our democracy. \\n   Section 527 is the latest point of vulnerability that has been found by the forces and flow of money in our political system. Section 527 offers tax exemption to organizations, primarily involved in election-related activities such as campaign committees, party committees, and PACs. That is what the law says it is supposed to do. It defines the type of organization it discovers as one whose function is, among other things, ``Influencing or attempting to influence the selection, nomination, election, or appointment of any individual to any Federal, State, or local public office.\\'\\' \\n   Because the Federal Election Campaign Act uses nearly identical language to define the entities it regulates, section 527 formally had been generally understood to apply only to those organizations that register as political committees under the Federal Election Campaign Act. \\n   Nevertheless, the flow of money moves to find a point of vulnerability in our existing legal system. A number of groups engaging in what they term ``issue advocacy campaigns\\'\\' and other election-related activities, have begun arguing that the near identical language of our Federal Election Campaign Act and section 527 actually mean two different things. This would be hilarious if it wasn\\'t so serious. In their view, these groups gain freedom from taxation by claiming they are seeking to influence the election of individuals to Federal office, but they claim they can evade regulation under the Campaign Act by asserting that they are not seeking to influence an election for Federal office. \\n   They are going two ways at once, trying to claim the benefit of two inconsistent laws, and, for the time being, getting away with it. As a result, unlike other tax-exempt groups, section 527 groups don\\'t even have to publicly disclose their existence. They gain both the public subsidy of tax exemption and the ability to shield from the American public the identity of those spending their money to try to influence our elections. Indeed, according to news reports, newly formed 527 organizations pushing the agenda of political parties are using the ability to mask the identity of their contributors as a means of courting wealthy donors who are seeking anonymity in their efforts to influence our elections. \\n   This is so venal, an end run on the clear intention of our laws, that I cannot believe we will let it continue. Section 527 organizations are not required to publicly disclose their existence. It is impossible to know the precise scope of this problem. The Internal Revenue Service private letter rulings, though, make clear that organizations that are intent on running what they call ``issue ad campaigns\\'\\' and engaging in other election-related activities are free to assert section 527 status. Of course, there have been numerous news reports that provide specific examples of groups taking advantage of these rulings. \\n   Common Cause recently issued a report which is engaging in unsettling reading, under the title ``Under the Radar: The Attack of the Stealth PACs on Our Nations\\'s Elections,\\'\\' which offers details on 527 groups set up by politicians, industry groups, right-leaning ideological groups, and left-leaning ideological groups. The advantages conferred by assuming this 527 form, which are the anonymity provided to both the organization and its donors, the ability to engage in unlimited political activity without losing your tax-exempt status, and significantly the exemption from gift tax which otherwise would be imposed on large donors, leaves no doubt that  these groups will continue to proliferate as the November election approaches. \\n   No one should doubt that the expansion of these groups poses a real and significant threat to the integrity and the fairness of our election system. One of the basic promises that our system makes is for full disclosure. Senator MCCAIN and Senator FEINGOLD have spoken of comments that have been made on this floor and elsewhere by those who opposed other forms of regulating and limiting campaign finance contributions, limits on expenditures, but at least support disclosure, sunshine, the right to know. The identity of the messenger, the identity of the contributor supporting a message, naturally, would help a citizen, a voter, reach a judgment on the quality and the effect of that message. \\n   The risk posed by the 527 loophole goes even further than depriving the American people of critical information. I believe it threatens the very heart of our democratic political process because allowing these groups to operate in the shadows poses a real and present danger of corruption and makes it difficult for anyone to vigilantly guard against that risk. The press has reported that a growing number of 527 groups have connections to, or even have been set up by, candidates and elected officials who are otherwise limited--clearly, at least so is the intention of the law--by other laws. Allowing individuals to give to these groups and allowing elected officials to solicit money for these groups without ever having to disclose their dealings to the public, at a minimum leads to exactly the appearance of corruption that the Supreme Court in some of its election law cases has warned against and sets the conditions clearly that would allow corruption to thrive. \\n   If people in public life are allowed to continue seeking money secretly, particularly sums of money that exceed what the average American makes in a year, there is no telling what will be asked for in return. And there is no predicting how many more tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions of our fellow citizens will turn away from our political system because they reach the conclusion that there is not actually equal access to our Government; that an individual or group or corporation that gives hundreds of thousands of dollars secretly to this kind of political committee clearly have more influence than they do, and it is not worth even turning out to vote. \\n   In the hopes of forestalling this growing cancer in our body politic, a bipartisan group of Members of the Senate earlier this year introduced two bills to deal with this 527 problem. The first was what we called our aspirational bill. It would have completely closed the 527 loophole by making clear that tax exemption under 527 is available only to organizations regulated under the Federal Elections Campaign Act. It was pretty straightforward and, in my opinion, eminently sensible and logical. If this bill were ever enacted, groups would no longer be able to tell one thing to the IRS to get a tax benefit and then deny the same thing to the FEC, the Federal Election Commission, in order to evade Federal Election Campaign Act regulation. \\n   But recognizing that a complete closing of this ever growing 527 loophole might not be possible to achieve in this Congress, we also offered a second alternative, slightly narrower. That is what this amendment is before the Senate now. It is aimed at forcing section 527 organizations simply to emerge from the dark shadows, from the secret corners, and let the public know who they are--that is not asking too much--where they get their money--that is a fundamental right--and how they spend it. \\n   This amendment would require 527 organizations to disclose their existence to the IRS, to file publicly available tax returns and to file with the IRS and make public reports specifying annual expenditures of at least $500 and identifying those who contribute at least $200 annually to the organization. That is not asking very much. It is simple fairness, basic facts, respecting the public\\'s right to know. \\n   No doubt opponents of this amendment may claim the proposal infringes on their first amendment rights, perhaps, to free speech and association. But nothing in this amendment infringes on those cherished freedoms in the slightest bit. This \\n   amendment does not prohibit anyone from speaking. It does not force any group that does not currently have to comply with the Federal Elections Campaign Act or disclose information about itself to do either of those things. This amendment speaks only to what a group must do if it wants the public subsidy of tax exemption, something the Supreme Court has made clear that no one has a constitutional right to have. We in Congress, Representatives of the people, makers of the law, have the right to attach conditions in return for the public subsidy of tax exemption. As the Supreme Court explained in Regan v. Taxation with Representation of Washington, a 1983 case:  \\n   Both tax exemptions and tax-deductibility are a form of subsidy that is administered through the tax system, [and] Congressional selection of particular entities or persons for entitlement to this sort of largess is obviously a matter of policy and discretion.......  \\n   That is policy and discretion to be exercised in the public interest by this Congress. Under this proposal, any group not wanting to disclose information about itself or abide by the election laws would be able to continue doing whatever it is doing now. It would just have to do so without the public subsidy of tax exemption conferred by section 527. Again, that is not asking too much. \\n   We have become so used to our campaign finance system\\'s long, slow descent that I fear it is sometimes hard to ignite the kind of outrage that should result when a new loophole starts to shred the very spirit of yet another law aimed at protecting the integrity of our system. \\n   I suppose if there is any direct relevance of this proposal to the Department of Defense Authorization Act on which it is offered, it is that generations of Americans have fought, been injured, and died for our political system, our principles, our values: The right to exercise the franchise, the right to know. We are witnessing, without acting to correct it, the corruption and erosion of those basic freedoms. \\n   This new 527 loophole should outrage us and we should act, I hope unanimously, across party lines, by adopting this amendment to put a stop to it. \\n   Mr. President, I urge all our colleagues to join us in supporting this proposal. I thank the Chair and I yield the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-20000518\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair and my friend from Michigan and my friend from West Virginia for his courtesy allowing me to go forward. \\n   Mr. President, I rise to support the motion to strike, and in doing so I join colleagues before me who have expressed what is clearly our very sincere respect for the two cosponsors of the part of the underlying bill which we seek to strike with our motion. There honestly are two no more distinguished Members of this body. May I say there are no more patriotic citizens that I have ever met than the Senator from West Virginia and the Senator from Virginia. So I go forward with a certain sense of awkwardness but certainly with a profound sense of respect for the two of them, even as I disagree with the provision regarding Kosovo that they have added to this appropriations bill before us. \\n   Much has been said on both sides. I will try to either say it quickly or add a few new thoughts. It seems to me we have to begin here by looking backwards; in some senses, way backwards. By coincidence, last night I was reading a new biography of President Woodrow Wilson. \\n   One of the chapters begins with a description of the election of 1912. The opening line says that as people were going to vote in the United States in 1912--and the great choices were Wilson, Teddy Roosevelt, and Taft--no one had in mind or could have imagined that 2 years later an event would occur in the Balkans that would eventually draw almost 2 million people into combat in that far away quarter--World War I. \\n   We have struggled with, been affected by, lost lives as a result of conflict in the Balkans which spread throughout Europe and which has always eventually engaged us because of our intimate relationship with Europe. We are a nation that, at the outset, was formed by children of Europe, by people who left Europe to come to these shores. We, of course, are much broader and more multicultural than that now, but that was our origin. \\n   Today our military and economic ties, our security and cultural ties with Europe are deep and they are broad. We may in the push and pull of the moment be drawn to other parts of the world. We are a global power today. But the base of our strength and the most comprehensive economic relationships we have and the heart of our international security posture has always been in Europe and is today. What happens in Europe matters to us today as it did in the second decade of this century, bloody as it was, which began with conflict in the Balkans. \\n   Again, as the ``third world war\\'\\' of the last century concluded--and I say that referring to the cold war--and new alliances began the movement of people, conflict broke out in the Balkans and threatened to go further and engage our European allies and threatened the stability of that region so important to us. \\n   I begin this way because what I want to suggest, and I hope I can convince people, is that what happened in Kosovo--the outbreak, again, of barbarism, aggression against the people by force and what became cosmetically described as ethnic cleansing--was a singling out of people because of their ethnicity, coincidentally their religion, and they were subjected to mass forced movement, exile from their country, murder, rape, and torture. \\n   The fires were burning again in the Balkans, and this time, having more recently confronted a similar threat in Bosnia, we waited, in my opinion, too long to get involved. We and our NATO allies acted on an immensely successful air campaign a little more than a year ago which stopped the barbarism, stopped the aggression, stopped the killing, and allowed more than a million refugees to return to the homes from which they had been brutally forced. \\n   All of this is by way of saying that what happened in Kosovo that led to the peacekeeping in which we are involved--and which is threatened by the underlying amendment offered by the Senators from West Virginia and Virginia--was a great victory. It was a great victory. \\n   General Clark recently returned from his position as SACEUR, our Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, a historic position, a position of great importance. He has been quoted frequently on the floor. In conversation with him, one of the things he said to me a week ago was that the reaction to what happened in Kosovo from the European public and the American public, including particularly the American political elite, was so remarkably different. In Europe, there was a sense of extraordinary pride about the course of events as they concluded last year in Kosovo, that stability, that freedom, that human rights had won a victory in Kosovo. Here General Clark worried the reaction was not so clear, that there was not the sense of pride that should have been felt because of a pivotal leadership role the United States of America played in ending the barbarism and aggression in Kosovo. \\n   I mention this today because it is perhaps that differing attitude that leads us in the Senate to consider the Byrd-Warner \\n   amendment to this Appropriations Committee bill, and also now we have witnessed the House take similar action on the question of whether our European allies are doing enough. Maybe we in this country never appreciated the significance of what we did. \\n   I believe history will show, when historians look back at the 1990s and judge what occurred, the United States and NATO interventions in Bosnia and Kosovo was a turning point, as an example that we and our allies had learned the lessons of the 20th century, the most bloody in history, unfortunately. One of the lessons is, if you turn your back on aggression and genocide, in the end it will find you; it will force you to turn your face to it; and you will face carnage and will be drawn into it at a cost that is ultimately so much greater. \\n   We achieved a great victory. I support this amendment to strike because the language in the underlying bill that it would strike I fear, I say respectfully, will snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. It will shake our alliance. It will send a message to Mr. Milosevic, as has been said over and over: Just wait it out; the United States is not a resolute power; it doesn\\'t understand what it did in Europe. \\n   It would encourage, unfortunately, those in Kosovo, particularly the Albanians I fear, to a certain extent the Serbs, to worry we are about to leave and to begin to take up arms again, the very arms, as part of this peace we are helping to enforce, they gave up. The Kosovo Liberation Army turned over its arms to the peacekeeping authorities. \\n   I know those who have sponsored the underlying amendment have said it is not their intention to cut and run, to undercut NATO, to encourage Milosevic, but I fear that will be the effect of this proposal, notwithstanding the intentions of its distinguished sponsors. \\n   If, as has been said by proponents of the underlying provision, this is just a message to our allies in Europe to meet their commitments, if it is just giving an opportunity to the incoming President next year, whomever it may be, whichever candidate it may be, to offer a plan to make a decision, then let\\'s do that. Let\\'s not put America on a course to withdraw, which is what this underlying proposal does, to literally cut and run. Let\\'s leave it to the next President to make those decisions. \\n   I was quite struck and appreciative of the statement Governor Bush has made on this. It is a statement that is made in the national interest. I hope all of us will heed it because it means the two major party candidates, Vice President GORE and Governor Bush, both have said they feel the underlying amendment would not only be bad for America\\'s national security interests but is something they do not want because it will hamstring whomever is privileged to occupy the White House in January of next year. \\n   Much has been said about the effects of this amendment. I want to just add this in addition to the way in which it will encourage Milosevic. Europe is stable now and yet not fully stable. A new Government has come to power in Russia. It is a Government that we are hopeful about and yet uncertain. \\n   The people of Central and Eastern Europe, who lived under Soviet domination for, oh, those four and more decades, in some cases, are now beginning to stretch, to be free, to develop market-based economies, self-government,  national independence. Some of them--three--now have joined NATO; a whole other group--I believe it is nine--have been put in line. This is a historic development and the most extraordinary and enormous victory for the forces of victory and freedom that won the cold war. \\n   I want to suggest to my colleagues that putting us on a course to withdraw our forces from Kosovo, from the peacekeeping effort, to withdraw our financial support for the economic and humanitarian reconstruction, will send a message of faithlessness, if I can say that, of irresoluteness, of lack of concern by the world\\'s superpower--the beacon of hope for those who yearn for freedom and now have achieved it post-cold war in Central and Eastern Europe--that perhaps our commitment there is not firm, and that as they begin to enjoy the sunlight of liberty, we may be pulling back and not worried if the clouds begin to come over them again. \\n   Our presence in Kosovo, important as it is to keeping the peace in Kosovo, is clearly more broadly important to the ongoing march of freedom for which we fought and won the cold war. In that sense, too, we would begin to be snatching defeat from the jaws of the great victory we won in the cold war. \\n   The same is true for places of conflict throughout the world where this kind of American irresoluteness--what will appear to be, whether it is intended or not, a cut-and-run approach--will encourage the enemies of freedom, the enemies of the United States, to take action, with the hope that the United States does not care anymore, that we have grown either so comfortable or so isolationist that we have taken a shorter range of view and are not prepared to exercise the political, strategic, and moral leadership on which I continue to believe the world depends. \\n   Much has been said here about the question of what our European allies have done or not done. I was at the annual security conference in Munich in February. We were battling with our European allies about whether they kept this $35 million commitment they made. They had not kept it then. They have done it now. \\n   But as has been said over and over again--I will not belabor it--the Europeans are paying more than their fair share, which is to say they are paying the overwhelming majority of the costs of the military and the humanitarian operation. \\n   Although the numbers are very difficult to be totally comfortable about as to who has given what--and I have tried very hard, working with the Congressional Research Service, the World Bank, the European Commission, and the Department of Defense, to pin these down--it does seem to me that, overall, an argument could be made not just that the Europeans are paying 80 or 85 percent of the costs of these operations in Kosovo but that they have met the terms thereby of the Warner part of the Byrd-Warner amendment. But the accounting can be difficult. \\n   I think the amendment, if it is put in place, becomes meddlesome and troublesome because it sends a message of doubt about our support and, on a technical accounting basis, actually could put us in a position where the President could find it difficult, on the technicalities, to certify that the Europeans have done what this amendment requires them to do. Therefore, we would be on the road to withdrawal, with all the consequences I have described. \\n   Surely there are better ways for us to express to our allies in Europe that we believe they are not meeting their commitments than this blunt instrument, putting this amendment on this appropriations bill. It is for that reason I support so strongly this motion to strike. \\n   I will just add two general points. The first is from a very interesting column from the Washington Times by Mr. Tod Lindberg on Tuesday, May 16, in which he, quite correctly, points to the ambivalence Congress has expressed regarding Kosovo, an ambivalence which is so inconsistent; it reminds us that although Congress has the power of the purse, that is why we elect Presidents and we call them Commanders in Chief and why we expect them to make the foreign and military policy of our country, because with 535 of us, it would be hard for us to get together and do what we need to do to protect our national interests with the kind of authority a Commander in Chief can have. \\n   Of course, we have the power of the purse, and we can exercise it. But we have tended, too often, to go in different directions. As Mr. Lindberg points out:  \\n   Kosovo, more or less from the moment the issues there became critical in the fall of 1998, has not exactly been Congress\\' finest hour. The nadir, perhaps, came a year ago during NATO\\'s air campaign itself, [while our pilots\\' flying actions endangered themselves over the Balkans] when the House of Representatives voted within a short span not to support the campaign and to double funding for it.  \\n   Remember the words from the Bible: If the sound of the trumpet is not clear, who will follow into battle? And 535 voices often find it hard not to sound a clear trumpet. I think that has been the case here. It will be the case if we do not strike this provision from this bill. \\n   Mr. Lindbergh finally, at the end of the column, makes a few points which I also would like to quote. He thinks what is expressed in this underlying amendment that we now seek to strike is not just concern about whether the Europeans are keeping their financial commitments, but I believe a strong argument could be made that they are; clearly, we are paying only a minority of the costs of this operation. That is undeniable. \\n   What is at work here, Mr. Lindberg says--I think, correctly--is not just the constitutional question that we have an obligation to exercise our judgment and decide whether we should stay or not--and, again, I say the way to do that is not to put us on a march to withdrawal when we are succeeding--but, he says, this amendment ``also serves for some as a false flag flying over isolationist sentiment--an opportunity to vent discontent with a whole range of American commitments without openly stating the general case. For some, setting a deadline for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Kosovo has nothing whatsoever to do with Kosovo; it\\'s just the opportune application of a general principle of disengagement to a particular case.\\'\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-2-20000518\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. I ask unanimous consent to have 2 more minutes. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-3-20000518\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I do think we have to ask ourselves--I do not make any accusations here, of course, with respect to all my colleagues. Lingering behind some sentiments is not just specific concern about Kosovo but what Mr. Lindberg calls, in the Washington Times, ``the opportune application of a general principle of disengagement.......\\'\\' \\n   If it is that, it is extremely consequential. We have been tempted over our history and have fought the impulse of isolationism and disengagement from the world, and every time we have succumbed it has come back to cost us dearly. \\n   I sat with our colleague from Nebraska, Senator KERREY, a week or two ago, discussing this very issue. Perhaps he has told this story on the floor. But he reminded me, on the 25th anniversary of the end of the Vietnam war, a newspaper asked him, because he is a distinguished and honored veteran of that conflict, whether he would write his thoughts about it. \\n   He said one of the thoughts that came to his mind is that 25 years after the end of the first war--which I referred to at the opening of my remarks--in 1943, the sons and some of the daughters of those who fought in the First World War, which ended in 1918, in 1943, were training for and beginning to go to war in Europe. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-4-20000518\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask the Chair for up to 5 more minutes. I hope not to use them. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-5-20000518\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. The powerful point of the Senator from Nebraska, Mr. KERREY, our distinguished colleague, was that, because the world and America did not learn the lesson of engagement after World War I, 25 years later  the sons and daughters of those who fought in World War I were again entering an even bloodier conflict, World War II. Twenty-five years after the end of Vietnam, because America had learned the lesson, had not turned isolationist, had been engaged, the sons and daughters of those who fought in Vietnam were not heading in massive numbers into a bloody world conflict. The price of that difference is involvement in potential conflicts which can grow into conflagrations, such as those in Kosovo. \\n   Mr. Lindberg closes his op-ed piece by saying:  \\n   The deadline in the Byrd-Warner amendment seems clear enough. But a deadline for withdrawal is not a policy. It\\'s an anti-policy. It says that as of the date specified, we don\\'t care what happens. If that sentiment is ever powerful enough to override a presidential veto, we are going to have a world of trouble on our hands.  \\n   With all respect, this is a momentous vote the Senate will cast today. I urge my colleagues to vote for the motion to strike. I thank the Chair and yield the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-20000517\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce two bills aimed at curtailing the newest threat to the integrity of our nation\\'s election process: the proliferation of so-called stealth PACs operating under Section 527 of the tax code. These groups exploit a recently discovered loophole in the tax code that allows organizations seeking to influence federal elections to fund their election work with undisclosed and unlimited contributions at the same time as they claim exemption from both federal taxation and the federal election laws. \\n   Section 527 of the tax code offers tax exemption to organizations primarily involved in election-related activities, like campaign committees, party committees and PACs. It defines the type of organization it covers as one whose function is, among other things, ``influencing or attempting to influence the selection, nomination, election, or appointment of any individual to any Federal, State, or local public office .......\\'\\' Because the Federal Election Campaign Act (``FECA\\'\\') uses near identical language to define the entities it regulates--organizations that spend or receive money ``for the purpose of influencing any election for Federal office\\'\\'--Section 527 formerly had been generally understood to apply only to those organizations that register as political committees under, and comply with, FECA, unless they focus on State or local activities or do not meet certain other specific FECA requirements). \\n   Nevertheless, a number of groups engaged in what they term issue advocacy campaigns and other election-related activity recently began arguing that the near identical language of FECA and Section 527 actually mean two different things. In their view, they can gain freedom from taxation by claiming that they are seeking to influence the election of individuals to Federal office, but may evade regulation under FECA, by asserting that they are not seeking to influence an election for Federal office. As a result--because, unlike other tax-exempt groups like 501(c)(3)s and (c)(4)s, Section 527 groups don\\'t even have to publicly disclose their existence--these groups gain both the public subsidy of tax exemption and the ability to shield from the American public the identity of those spending their money to try to influence our elections. Indeed, according to news reports, newly-formed 527 organizations pushing the agenda of political parties are using the ability to mask the identities of their contributors as a means of courting wealthy donors seeking anonymity in their efforts to influence our elections. \\n   Because Section 527 organizations are not required to publicly disclose their existence, it is impossible to know the precise scope of this problem. The IRS\\'s private letter rulings, though, make clear that organizations intent on running what they call issue ad campaigns and engaging in other \\n   election-related activity are free to assert Section 527 status, and news reports provide specific examples of groups taking advantage of these rulings. Roll Call reported the early signs of this phenomenon in late 1997, when it published an article on the decision of Citizens for Reform and Citizens for the Republic Education Fund, two Triad Management Services organizations that ran $2 million issue ad campaigns during the 1996 elections, to switch from 501(c)(4) status (which imposes limits on a group\\'s political activity) to 527 status after the 1996 campaigns. A more recent Roll Call report recounted the efforts of a team of GOP lawyers and consultants to shop an organization called Citizens for the Republican Congress to donors as a way to bankroll up to $35 million in pro-Republican issue ads in the 30 most competitive House races. And Common Cause\\'s recent report Under The Radar: The Attack Of The ``Stealth PACs\\'\\' On Our Nation\\'s Elections offers details on 527 groups set up by politicians (Congressmen J.C. WATTS and TOM DELAY), industry groups (the pharmaceutical industry-funded Citizens for Better Medicare) and ideological groups from all sides of the political spectrum (the Wyly Brothers\\' Republicans for Clean Air, Ben & Jerry\\'s Business Leaders for Sensible Priorities and a 527 set up by the Sierra Club). The advantages conferred by assuming the 527 form--the anonymity provided to both the organization and its donors, the ability to engage in unlimited political activity without losing tax-exempt status, and the exemption from the gift tax imposed on very large donors--leave no doubt that these groups will proliferate as the November election approaches. \\n   And none of us should doubt that the proliferation of these groups--with their potential to serve as secret slush funds for candidates and parties, their ability to run difficult-to-trace attack ads, and their promise of anonymity to those seeking to spend huge amounts of money to influence our elections--poses a real and significant threat to the integrity and fairness of our elections. We all know that the identity of the messenger has a lot of influence on how we view a message. In the case of a campaign, an ad or piece of direct mail attacking one candidate or lauding another carries a lot more weight when it is run or sent by a group called ``Citizens for Good Government\\'\\' or ``Committee for our Children\\'\\' than when a candidate, party or someone with a financial stake in the election publicly acknowledges sponsorship of the ad or mailing. Without a rule requiring a group involved in elections to disclose who is behind it and where the group gets its money, the public is deprived of vital information that allows it to judge the group\\'s credibility and its message, throwing into doubt the very integrity of our elections. With this incredibly powerful tool in their hands, can anyone doubt that come November, we will see more and more candidates, parties and groups with financial interests in the outcome of our elections taking advantage of the 527 loophole to run more and more attack ads and issue more and more negative mailings in the name of groups with innocuous-sounding names? \\n   But the risk posed by the 527 loophole goes even farther than depriving the American people of critical information. I believe that it threatens the very heart of our democratic political process. Allowing these groups to operate in the shadows poses a real risk of corruption and makes it difficult for us to vigilantly guard against that risk. The press has reported that a growing number of 527 groups have connections to--or even have been set up by--candidates and elected officials. Allowing wealthy individuals to give to these groups--and allowing elected officials to solicit money for these groups--without ever having to disclose their dealings to the public, at a minimum,  leads to an appearance of corruption and sets the conditions that would allow actual corruption to thrive. If politicians are allowed to continue secretly seeking money--particularly sums of money \\n   that exceed what the average American makes in a year--there is no telling what will be asked for in return. \\n   In the hopes of forestalling the conversion of yet another loophole into yet another sinkhole for the integrity of our elections, I am joined today by a distinguished bipartisan coalition in introducing two bills addressing the 527 problem. Our first bill--I think of it as our aspirational bill--would completely close the Section 527 loophole, by making clear that tax exemption under Section 527 is available only to organizations regulated under FECA (unless an organization focuses exclusively on State or local elections or does not meet certain other explicit FECA requirements). If this bill were enacted, groups no longer would be able to tell one thing to the IRS to get a tax benefit and then deny the same thing to the FEC in order to evade FECA regulation. \\n   Recognizing that a complete closing of the 527 loophole may not be possible to achieve this Congress, however, we are offering a narrower alternative--a pragmatic bill--aimed at forcing Section 527 organizations to emerge from the shadows and let the public know who they are, where they get their money and how they spend it. The bill would require 527 organizations to disclose their existence to the IRS, to file publicly available tax returns and to file with the IRS and make public reports specifying annual expenditures of at least $500 and identifying those who contribute at least $200 annually to the organization. Although this won\\'t solve the whole problem, at least it will make sure that no group can hide in the shadows as it spends millions to influence the way we vote and who we choose to run this country. \\n   No doubt opponents of this legislation will claim that our proposal infringes on their First Amendment rights to free speech and association. But, Mr. President, nothing in our bills infringes on those cherished freedoms in the slightest bit. Our bills do not prohibit anyone from speaking, nor do they force any group that does not currently have to comply with FECA or disclose information about itself to do either of those things. Our bills speak only to what a group must do if it wants the public subsidy of tax exemption--something the Supreme Court has made clear no one has a constitutional right to have. As the Court explained in Regan v. Taxation with Representation of Washington, 461 U.S. 540, 544, 545, 549 (1983), ``[b]oth tax exemptions and tax-deductibility are a form of subsidy that is administered through the tax system,\\'\\' and ``Congressional selection of particular entities or persons for entitlement to this sort of largesse is obviously a matter of policy and discretion . . .\\'\\' Under our bills, any group not wanting to disclose information about itself or abide by the election laws would be able to continue doing whatever it is doing now--it would just have to do so without the public subsidy of tax exemption conferred by Section 527. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-20000509\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask that amendment No. 3127, an amendment in the nature of a substitute to the bill, be called up at this time. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-2-20000509\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment be dispensed with. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-3-20000509\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. \\n   Mr. President, I am very proud to offer this amendment on behalf of the colleagues who have been mentioned, eight in number, and myself. We have worked for a very long time on the contents of this amendment. We have  spent a lot of time in our home States and elsewhere observing what is happening in our public schools today, and this amendment is a response to what we have seen. \\n   I would roughly categorize that in two ways, which I will describe in a little more detail. \\n   The first is, there remains an unacceptable gap in achievement levels between children in America\\'s public schools who are disadvantaged economically and those who are advantaged, and that is unfair and unacceptable. \\n   Secondly, there is occurring, and has been occurring throughout our country over the last decade really, an extraordinary outburst of educational reform at the local level. Superior efforts are being made by teachers, by school administrators, by superintendents, by parents, by whole communities, to try to do everything possible to improve the status quo because when the status quo is not adequately educating our children, in this information age particularly, we are not achieving one of the great goals of our Government. \\n   This proposal we make today is an attempt to respond to both of those observations and to use the 5-year reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act as an opportunity to leverage Federal dollars, perhaps small in percentage in the overall cost of public education in our country but large in absolute terms, to do better at educating the poor and \\n   disadvantaged in our country and do much better at encouraging, facilitating, and financially supporting the extraordinary educational reform efforts going on around the country, I am pleased to say particularly in States such as my own State of Connecticut. \\n   As we continue this debate on the ESEA, Congress itself is facing a major test, one that will likely be far more important to the future of millions of America\\'s children than any of the school exams or assessments they have to take this year. \\n   Our challenge in Congress is to reform, and in some ways to reinvent in some fundamental ways, our Federal education policy to help States and school districts meet the demands of this new century and to help us fulfill our responsibility to provide a quality education for all of America\\'s children. \\n   That is why I join today with eight of my colleagues, and perhaps at least one more, in offering this amendment to the bill before us that calls for a totally new approach to Federal education policy, one that we who cosponsor this amendment believe could also serve as a bridge to a bipartisan solution to this problem, to a bipartisan reauthorization of the ESEA. Of course, that has to be the goal to which all of us aspire. It may be an interesting debate on Federal education policy, it may be stimulating, it may be fascinating, it may even be educational, but if it is only a debate without a result, it does nothing for the children of our country. \\n   We hope this proposal we are making today can be a bridge to a bipartisan reauthorization of ESEA. Our approach will refocus our national policy on helping States and local school districts raise academic achievement for all children. That has to be our priority. It would put the priority, therefore, for Federal programs on performance instead of process, on delivering results instead of developing rules. \\n   I am asking not just how much we are going to spend on education or what specific pipes it goes through to the State and local districts, but on what comes out of the other end, which is to say how are our children being educated. \\n   Our approach calls on States and local districts to enter into a new compact with the Federal Government to work together to strengthen standards and to improve educational opportunities, particularly for America\\'s poorest children. It would provide State and local educators with significantly more funding from the Federal Government and significantly more flexibility in using that funding to meet their specific local needs. \\n   In exchange, our proposal would demand real accountability and, for the first time, impose consequences on schools that continue to fail to show progress. You cannot have a system of accountability that winks at those who fail to appropriately educate our children. \\n   In order to implement effective education policy, I think we have to first acknowledge that there are serious problems with the performance of many of our schools and that public confidence in public education will erode seriously if we do not acknowledge and address those problems now. \\n   While overall student achievement is up, we must face the alarming achievement gap that still separates poorer minority Americans from better off white Americans. \\n   According to the State-by-State reading scores of fourth graders, in the National Assessment of Educational Progress, the achievement gap between African American and Caucasian American students actually grew larger in 16 States between 1992 and 1998, notwithstanding the billions of dollars we have sent back to the States and local districts to reduce that gap over the last 35 years. The gap between Hispanic American students and white American students became larger in nine States over the same period of time. Perhaps most alarming is the data that reveals that the average African American and Latino American 17-year-old has about the same reading and math skills as the average Caucasian American 13-year-old. That is an unfair and unacceptable outrage. We must do something about it. \\n   One recent report states:  \\n   Students are being unconsciously eliminated from the candidate pool of Information Technology workers by the knowledge and attitudes they acquire in their K-12 years. Many students do not learn the basic skills of reasoning, mathematics, and communication that provide the foundation for higher education or entry-level jobs in Information Technology work.  \\n   One cause of this, I am afraid, is that we have not done a very good job in recent years of providing more of our children with high-quality teachers, a critical component to higher student achievement. After all, what is education? Education is one person, the teacher, conveying knowledge and the ability to learn to another person, a younger person, a student. We are failing to deliver enough teachers to the classroom who truly know their subject matter. \\n   One national survey found that one-fourth of all secondary school teachers did not major in their core area of instruction. And note this. In terms of the inequity in the current system, in the school districts with the highest concentration of minority students, those students have less than a 50-percent chance of getting a math or science teacher who has a license or degree in those fields. So we are putting them behind before they even get started. \\n   While more money alone will not solve our problems, we cannot honestly expect to reform and reinvent our schools \\n   without more money either. The reality is, there is a tremendous need for the additional investment in our public schools, not just in urban areas but in every kind of community, including, of course, poorer rural communities. \\n   Not only are thousands of crumbling and overcrowded schools in need of modernization, but a looming shortage of 2 million new teachers to train and hire faces our country. Add to this billions in spiraling special education costs the local school districts have to meet and we can see we cannot really uphold our responsibility without sending more money back to the States and local school districts. \\n   Trying to raise standards at a time of profound social turbulence for our poorest families means we will need to expend new sums to reach and teach children who in the past, frankly, have never been asked to excel, whose failure was accepted--in some senses perhaps even encouraged--who in the present will have to overcome enormous hurdles to do better. \\n   At the same time that schools are trying to cope with new and complex societal changes, we are demanding that they teach more than they ever have before. Parents and potential employers both want better teachers, stronger standards, and higher test scores for all our students as well as state-of-the-art technology and skills to match. \\n   It is a tribute to the many dedicated men and women who are responsible for teaching our children every schoolday across America that the bulk of our schools are as good as they are today in light of these broader contextual and sociological pressures. I believe--and I believe it is a fundamental  premise of our system of government in our education system--that any child can learn, any child. That has been proven over and over again in the best schools in my home State of Connecticut and in many of America\\'s poorest cities and rural areas. There are, in fact, plenty of positives to highlight in public education today, which is something else we have to acknowledge, yet too often do not, as part of this debate. \\n   I have made a real effort over the last few years to visit a broad range of public schools and programs in Connecticut. I can tell you that there is much happening in our schools we can be heartened by, proud of, and learn from. \\n   There is the exemplary John Barry Elementary School in Meriden, CT, for instance, which has a very-high-poverty, high-mobility student population but, through intervention programs, has had remarkable success in improving the reading skills of many of its students. \\n   There is the Side By Side Charter School in Norwalk--1 of 17 charters in Connecticut--which has created an exemplary multicultural, multiracial program in response to the challenges of a State court decision, Sheff versus O\\'Neill, to diminish racial isolation and segregation in our schools. Side By Side is experimenting with a different approach to classroom assignments, having students stay with teachers for 2 consecutive years to take advantage of the relationships that develop. By all indications, it is working quite well for those kids. \\n   There is the Bridge Academy, which is a charter high school in Bridgeport, CT, formed, as so many of the most effective schools have been, by teachers from the public schools who wanted to go out and run their own schools to create the environment in which they believed they could best teach. It is a remarkable experience to visit this school in Bridgeport. \\n   I remember when I went to the students a second time a couple months ago. Some people criticize charter schools and say they skim off the best students from the other schools. The kids laughed. One of the young women there, high school age, said, ``I think you can say, Mr. Senator, that what you have before you is the worst students from the public high schools.\\'\\' She said, ``I will go one step further. If I remained at the high school I was attending, I would not be in the high school; I would have dropped out by now. I was going nowhere.\\'\\' But there was something about this school, the Bridge Academy, which, she said to me, maybe was the smaller class size, interestingly. ``Maybe it is the fact that we know the teachers here really care about us. We are like a family here. Whatever it is, I have worked very hard and I have done things I thought I was never able to do. I am going to college next year.\\'\\' \\n   That is a remarkable story. I don\\'t have the number with me, but a great majority of the students graduating there are going to college next year. They will probably have the acceptance letter on the central bulletin board in the school. But that is occurring. In Connecticut, we have the BEST program, which is building on previous efforts to raise teacher skills and salaries. It is now targeting additional State aid and training and, most importantly, mentoring support to help local school districts bring in new teachers and prepare them to excel. It is very exciting to see the more senior teachers--the mentors--committing time, with little or no extra compensation, to help the younger teachers learn how to be good teachers. \\n   I think you have to say that is one of the reasons why Connecticut scores on the national tests have now gone to the top. It is one of the big reasons why they have, and it is why this BEST program of mentoring is cited by many groups, including the National Commission on Teaching in America\\'s Future, as a model for us to follow. \\n   A number of other States, including, by most accounts, North Carolina and Texas, have moved in the same direction, refocusing their education systems, not on process but on performance, not on prescriptive rules and regulations but on results. More and more of them are, in fact, adopting what might be called a reinvest, reinvent and responsibility strategy by, first, infusing new resources into their public education system; second, giving local districts more flexibility; and, third, demanding new measures and mechanisms of accountability to increase the chances that these investments will yield the intended return, meaning improved academic achievement by more students. \\n   To ensure that more States and localities have the ability to build on these successes around the country and prepare every student to succeed in the classroom, which has to be our national objective, we must invest more resources. The amendment my colleagues and I are offering today would boost ESEA funding by $35 billion over the next 5 years. But we also believe that the impact of this funding will be severely diluted if it is not better targeted to the worst performing schools and if it is not coupled with a demand for results. That is why we not only increase title I funding for disadvantaged kids by 50 percent, but we use the more targeted formula for distributing those dollars to schools with the highest concentrations of poverty. That is why we develop a new accountability system that strips Federal funding from States that continually fail to \\n   meet their performance goals. \\n   I wish to highlight for a moment our formula changes in title I on the hope that they will draw some attention to an area I believe is very worthy of debate, which is how best to target funds to the poorest children, the disadvantaged, who are still being left behind in great numbers in our education system. \\n   Our formula distributes more of the new funding through the targeted grant formula enacted into law by Congress in 1994, which has never been funded by congressional appropriators. It is progressive, but there is no money in it. It ensures that no State will lose funds while providing for better targeting of new funds with those States with the highest rates of poverty. In other words, it has a hold harmless in the current level of funding under title I, but it takes the new money and targets it to those who need it most. I am calling for this targeting to the school districts receiving the highest percentage of poor children. \\n   We must face the fact that title I funds today are currently spread too thin to help the truly disadvantaged. According to a 1999 CRS report, title I grants are provided to approximately 90 percent of all local education agencies--way beyond what we would guess are the truly needy--and 58 percent of all public schools receive title I money. \\n   Federal funds for poor children are currently distributed through two grants known as the basic grant and the concentration grant. In order to be eligible for the basic grants, through which 85 percent of title I money is now distributed, local school districts only need to have 10 school age children from low-income families, and these children must constitute only 2 percent of the total school age population. I want to repeat that because it is so stunning. When I first read it, I went back to my staff and the documents to see if I had read it right. This is the result of, frankly, a political formula. In order to be eligible for basic grants, through which 85 percent of title I funds are distributed--it is supposed to help disadvantaged kids--local districts only need to have 10 school age children from low-income families, and those children must constitute only 2 percent of the school age population. You can see how that money, therefore, is being spread so thin that a lot of poor kids are not getting help and a lot of kids who are not so poor, from schools in which there are few poor kids, are receiving that money. \\n   Under the concentration grant, districts with a child poverty rate of 15 percent are eligible to receive funding. That is a little better but still minimal. With those low thresholds, we have to ask ourselves are we really living up to the original intent of the ESEA, which was to ensure that poor children have access to a quality education on the same level as more affluent children. I think the answer has to be, no, we are not. That is what the facts say. In fact, another number, which unsettled me even more, is one out of every five schools in America that has between 50 and 75 percent of its student body under the poverty level doesn\\'t receive a dime of title I money. One out of every five schools in America that has half to three-quarters of its student population under the poverty level doesn\\'t receive a dime of  title I money, which is supposed to benefit exactly those children. \\n   I think we have to acknowledge that the current formula is not doing what it should be doing. It is a starting point and a \\n   way to draw our attention and resources back to the original intent of this act and the primary function of the Federal Government in education stated in 1965, which we are not fulfilling now, and that is to better educate economically disadvantaged children. \\n   In calling for a refocus of our Federal priorities, we who have sponsored this amendment agree with those concerned that the current system of Federal education grants are both too numerous and too bureaucratic, too prescriptive, and too strong on mandates from Washington. That is why this amendment eliminates dozens of federally microtargeted, micromanaged programs that are redundant or incidental to our core national mission of raising academic achievement. We also believe we have a great overriding national interest in promoting a few important education goals, and chief among them is delivering on the promise of equal opportunity. It is irresponsible, it seems to us, to hand out Federal dollars to the localities with no questions asked and no thought of national priorities. That is why we carve out separate titles in those areas that we think are critical to helping local districts elevate the performance of their schools. \\n   In other words, we consolidate almost 50 existing Federal categorical grant programs into the title I program for disadvantaged kids, the largest by far. And performance-based grant programs in which we state a national objective but give the local school district and the State the opportunity and the authority to work out their priorities are in meeting those objectives. \\n   The first of these is title I with more money, $12 billion--a 50-percent increase in better targeting. \\n   The second--a performance-based grant program--would combine various teacher training and professional development programs into a single teacher-quality grant, increase funding by 100 percent to $1.6 billion annually--the quality of our teachers is so important--and challenge each State to pursue the kind of bold, performance-based reforms, if it is their desire and choice, and higher salaries for teachers, as my own State of Connecticut has undertaken with great success and effect. \\n   The third performance-based grant program would reform the Federal Bilingual Education Program and hopefully diffuse the ongoing controversy surrounding it by making it absolutely clear that our national mission is to help immigrant children learn and master English, as well, of course, as to achieve high levels of achievement on all subjects. We must be willing to back this commitment with more resources--the resources that are essential to help ensure that all limited English-proficient students are served better and are not left behind, and that the gap between their knowledge and that of the majority does not grow larger in the years ahead as it has in the years immediately past. \\n   Under our approach, funding for limited English-proficient programs would be more than doubled to $1 billion a year and for the first time be distributed to States and local districts through a reliable formula based on the number of students who need help with their English proficiency. As a result, school districts serving large LEP--limited English-proficient--and high-poverty student populations would for the first time be guaranteed Federal funding and would not be penalized because of their inability to hire clever proposal writers for competitive grants. \\n   The fourth performance-based grant title would provide greater choice within the public school framework by authorizing additional funding for charter school startups and new incentives for expanding local, intradistrict public school choice programs. \\n   The fifth performance-based grant program in this amendment would establish and radically restructure the remaining ESEA and ensure that funds are much better targeted while giving local districts more flexibility. \\n   In this new title VI, our amendment would consolidate more than 20 different programs into a single, high-performance initiatives title with a focus on supporting bold new ideas, such as expanding access to summer school and afterschool programs, improving school safety, and building technological literacy, which is to say to close the looming digital divide in our country for our children before it gets deep and unfixable. \\n   We increase overall funding for these innovative programs by more than $200 million annually and distribute this aid through a formula that targets more resources for the highest poverty areas. \\n   The boldest changes we are proposing are in the new accountability title. As of today, we have plenty of rules and requirements on inputs, on how funding is to be allocated and who must be served, but little if any attention to outcomes on how schools ultimately perform in educating children. This amendment would reverse that imbalance by linking Federal funding to the progress State and local districts make in raising academic achievements. It would call on State and local leaders to set specific performance standards and adopt rigorous amendments for measuring how each district is faring and meeting these goals. In turn, States that exceed those goals would be rewarded with additional funds, and those that fail repeatedly to show progress would be penalized. In other words, for the first time there would be consequences for schools that perform poorly. \\n   In discussing how exactly to impose those consequences, we have run into understandable concerns about whether we can penalize failing schools and school systems without also hurting the children. \\n   The truth is we are hurting too many children right now, especially the most economically and sociologically vulnerable of them, by forcing them to attend chronically troubled schools that are accountable to no one--a situation that is just not acceptable anymore. Our amendment minimizes the potential negative impact of these consequences on students. \\n   It provides the States with 3 years to set their performance-based goals and put in place a monitoring system for gauging how local districts are progressing. It also provides additional resources for States to help school districts identify and then improve low-performing schools. \\n   If after those 3 years the State is still failing to meet its goals, the State would be cut in its administrative funding by 50 percent. Only after 4 years of underperformance would dollars targeted for the classroom through the new title VI be put in jeopardy. At that point, protecting kids by continuing to subsidize bad schools honestly becomes more like punishing them. \\n   I want to point out that at no point would our proposal cut title I funding, or the largest part of ESEA--the part focused on the needs of our poorest children. \\n   Another concern that may be raised is that these performance-based grants are open-ended block grants in sheep\\'s clothing. There are substantial differences between a straight block-grant approach and our performance-based grant proposal. First, in most block grant proposals, the accountability mechanisms are often nonexistent or, if they are, they are quite vague. Our bill would have tangible consequences pegged not just to raising test scores in the more affluent areas, but to closing the troubling achievement gap between them and students in the poor, largely minority districts. \\n   We believe our amendment embraces a commonsense strategy--reinvest in our public schools, reinvent the way we run them, and restore a sense of responsibility in our schools to the children who we are supposed to be educating and to their parents. Hence the title of our bill, ``The Public Education Reinvention, Reinvestment, and Responsibility Act,\\'\\' which we call RRR for short. \\n   I guess you could say our approach in this amendment is modest enough to recognize that there are no easy answers, particularly not from the Federal Government, for turning around low-performing schools, to lifting teaching standards, to closing the debilitating achievement gap, and that most of those answers won\\'t be found in Washington anyway. But our proposal is bold enough to try to harness  our unique ability to set the national agenda and recast the Federal Government as an active catalyst for educational success instead of a passive enabler of failure. \\n   Finally, this debate raises again for all of us in the Senate the basic question: Did we come here to produce or to posture? Are we going to be practical or are we going to be partisan? \\n   At this moment, when our constituents seem to be telling us everywhere in the country that the deed they most want us to do is to help reform the public schools of this country, are we going to be content with a debate that does not produce a bill? \\n   At this moment, the apparent answers to these questions are not encouraging. But there is still time. And we hope this amendment can be the path to bipartisan discussions, compromises, and ultimately educational reform. \\n   I thank my colleagues who are cosponsors of this bill for the contributions that each and every one of them has made. I urge my fellow Members of the Senate in the time ahead to take the time to look at our proposal with an open mind--nobody will like every part of it--and to see if there is enough here to form the basis of a bridge that a significant majority of us can walk across to achieve a bipartisan reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. \\n   I thank the Chair. I thank my colleagues. \\n   I yield the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-4-20000509\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, briefly, if I may respond to the two questions, and I appreciate the comments of my colleague from Connecticut. \\n   It has been a pleasure, as always, to work with the Senator and others. We have made progress. I am grateful for his acknowledging that. I am also grateful for his long-time progressive leadership in this whole area of public education. I thank my friend from Minnesota for his kind words about the bill. \\n   I respond briefly to the two good and fair questions. We struggled with both of them, particularly the question that if we set up a system where we give more money for education, and we want to reorient the program so we are not just arguing about how much money we will send or, when the auditors come from Washington, they do not just ask if we are spending the money in the particular paths we were told to spend it in, but that somebody asks: What is the result? Are the kids educated? \\n   That is what we want to see happen, to put teeth into it. We believed we had to reward and punish. We have bonuses for schools and States that do well. How do we have answers without punishing the kids? That is a struggle. One answer is that the kids, particularly poor kids, are too often punished by the status quo because they do not get a good education and they are trapped by income. They have nowhere else to  go even though their parents clearly want a better way. \\n   We have set this out over a period of years and allowed the States themselves to set the standard of adequate, clear progress. We are not setting an absolute standard. We are \\n   saying: You set the standard for each school district, for each school. The standard is, how much do you want to improve each year from the base, where they are now--not where an idealized base might be but where they are now. \\n   Our first sanction: When a school fails to achieve its adequate clear progress for 2 years, it goes on to a ``troubled\" list and extra money comes in to help the school. If after 4 years it does not get raised--the kids are the victims, they are being punished--at that point, the bill says the school system has a choice: Radically restructure the school into a charter school, perhaps, or something similar within the public school system, or close it and give every child and their parents the right to go to a higher performing public school in the district. \\n   Beyond that, if the State continues not to make the adequate yearly progress, the Senator is right, after 3 years they get 50 percent taken from the State administrative budgets. That was our attempt to impose penalties without hitting the kids. \\n   Finally, after 4 years, if there is no adequate yearly progress, something is really wrong, then we take 30 percent of title VI, the public school innovation title. Yes, that reduces some programs that could be enrichment and improvement programs, but at some point we have to put teeth in the system to make it work. \\n   In no event, I stress to my friend from Minnesota, do we ever take any money away from title I for disadvantaged kids. That, we thought, would be unfair. We will not touch the basic program to help disadvantaged kids learn better. \\n   I was surprised that in my State of Connecticut when we introduced the bill, the area of the bill that got the most concern was from the paraprofessionals themselves who feared we were going to force them to get a college degree or put them out of jobs. Our aims are exactly what the Senator has said. I was surprised to learn that 25 percent of title I money around the country is spent on paraprofessionals. Some of that is very well spent because they supplement what the teacher is doing or they provide nonteaching support for children which can be critical to the child\\'s ability to learn. \\n   Our basic aim is what the Senator from Minnesota said. Let\\'s not shortchange poor kids by asking paraprofessionals who are not trained to be teachers to be their teachers. Suburban schools would not accept that. We shouldn\\'t accept it for our poorest children. Let\\'s try to help them upgrade themselves. Also, we provide State-adopted certification programs for the paraprofessionals. \\n   I hope my answers have been responsive. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-20000509\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. \\n   I thank my friend and colleague from Arkansas, Senator LINCOLN, not only for a superb statement on behalf of this amendment but for the work the Senator has done as we developed the proposal, for the practical experience and common sense she brought, specifically for her genuine advocacy for children, particularly rural poor children. \\n   I thank the Senator for that and for her excellent statement. \\n   I ask that Senator FEINSTEIN of California be added as a cosponsor. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-2-20000509\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, this brings to double figures the cosponsors. We now have 10 cosponsors. We are proud to have the Senator from California with us. \\n   I yield the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-3-20000509\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume from the amendment. I thank the Chair. I thank my friend and colleague from Texas for her thoughtful statement. I would like to respond to it. \\n   It is interesting in this debate how common the usage of terms is on both sides. You have to really get down into the details. \\n   The Senator from Texas talked about her support of flexibility for school systems at the local level. That is a centerpiece of the amendment that is now before the Senate, which is to consolidate a whole series of current Federal categorical grant education programs and give the local school systems some flexibility in the use of that money. But I think the difference between our proposal, the proposal before the Senate now, and the underlying bill is the difference between flexibility with purpose and essentially a blank check. \\n   In our proposal, we have taken a series of categorical grant programs and put them together into four broad titles. We call them performance-based  partnership grants--not block grants. As I understand block grants, they are basically pooling money and sending it back to the States and localities to be spent for education as they would wish. \\n   As others have pointed out before, and Senator KENNEDY particularly, at the outset of the ESEA program, the Federal Government essentially gave block grants to the communities and States. It was found that the money was being spent for what most in Congress at that time did not think were priority educational goals. They were not being spent for the focused purpose of the ESEA, which was to help disadvantaged children. \\n   Block grants don\\'t target the disadvantaged children, and they don\\'t have enough accountability for results that are ongoing. There is no guidance from the Federal Government. I think this is a broad category of how the money should be spent. This is the difference between the underlying bill and the amendment before us now. \\n   Yes, we believe that Washington doesn\\'t have all the answers. Yes, we think that some of the current categorical grant programs are too focused with too much micromanagement. So we fold them together. But we feel very strongly that if we in Congress and the Federal Government are authorizing and appropriating literally billions of dollars to be spent by the States and localities on education, it is not just our right but our responsibility to set overall standards, categories, and goals for how that money should be spent. \\n   When we say we create performance-based partnership grants, that is what we mean. They are partnerships between the Federal, State, and local governments to achieve national educational goals. \\n   I will get to that in a minute. \\n   They are performance-based because there is an annual measurement of how students are doing. That is what this is all about. Is adequate yearly progress being made on these various proposals? If not, we ought to rush in with some extra help. If it continues to not be made, then we ought to impose some sanctions. \\n   We have taken these four titles and asked that the localities spend in areas that we think enjoy broad support in the Nation as priority educational areas. \\n   First and foremost, I think we granted title I for disadvantaged children. But of the other four, first and foremost, here is more money than the Federal Government has ever sent to the States and localities before for the purpose of improving teacher quality. \\n   Second, here again, it is more money than the Federal Government has ever sent back before for the purpose of improving programs in limited-English proficiency, commonly known as bilingual education. It is a critical need. Too many children for whom English is not the first language are not getting the education they should get. \\n   Third, public school choice--a great concept that is being adopted at the local level; again, a new funding stream to create new charter schools and to create new experiments in public school choice. Let parents and children have some choice within the public school setting by creating competition and forces that will improve the overall quality of education. \\n   Finally, a broad category of what might be called public school innovation, including afterschool programs, summer school programs. Whatever the localities may decide is an innovative idea, we want them to be able to test. \\n   There is a big difference between sending a blank check from Washington back to the States and localities, saying here is a substantially increased check but we are asking that localities spend it in one of these four priority areas and we are going to hold localities accountable every year for the results of that spending. \\n   Ultimately, that is what matters. It is interesting and not unimportant to talk about performance-based partnership grants, but ultimately it is important to consolidate categorical grants. What is most important is, What is the result? Are our children being better educated? If not, we in Washington will set up a system that does not accept failure, that does not allow the Federal Government to sit back and accept failure, but pushes into the debate and the action to encourage success for our children. \\n   The second broad point of response is on the question of teacher quality. As we all know, we have a rising need for new teachers--2 million over the next decade. We also want to make sure those teachers are the most able. There are a lot of ways to do this. In my State of Connecticut, the legislature adopted a program a decade or more ago that has worked. It begins with the State of Connecticut setting standards for paying teachers more money. It is true we get what we pay for. There are a certain number of people who have devoted themselves to teaching, regardless of salary, because they had a sense of mission. It is what gave them satisfaction. In an increasingly competitive economy, one of the ways we make it easier to attract the best people to teach is by paying more money. \\n   The second is to create opportunities in midcareer for people to come into teaching. I point out to my friend from Texas, title II of our proposal on teacher quality specifically urges the States to open up alternative paths for people. In our proposal, title II encourages the localities to do exactly what Senator HUTCHISON advocates, which is to create alternative paths to teacher certification for people in midcareers so we can get the best people to better educate our children. \\n   We think this is a balanced proposal. We ask our colleagues to consider it and hopefully support it as we come close to the time for voting. \\n   I yield the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-4-20000509\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my good friend and colleague from the State of Washington for his gracious words and for the discussions we have been having for almost 2 years about this particular reauthorization,  in which I have learned a lot. I appreciate his openmindedness. \\n   These discussions continue more broadly now. As he said, there are gaps remaining, but it has been a very good faith and worthwhile process. I look forward to continuing it with him and others in the days ahead toward the aim, which we hope is not going to elude us, of having a bipartisan reauthorization of ESEA. \\n   I am grateful that the Senator from Virginia has come to the floor to speak on behalf of the amendment that is before the Senate. Senator ROBB is a cosponsor. He has been very active in our discussions of this proposal and, as always, he brings to these discussions the clear-headed vision based on experience-- in this case, not only his experience as the Senator but valuable experience as the Governor of Virginia. \\n   I yield whatever time Senator ROBB needs to discuss this proposal. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-20000509\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. The Senator from Michigan is correct. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-2-20000509\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. The Senator is correct. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-20000504\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I wanted to bring to the attention of my colleagues an important letter dated March 22, 2000 sent to our Senate leadership by forty-seven leaders of our high technology companies, universities and labor organizations who are members of the highly-respected Council on Competitiveness. The letter argues for a significant increase in federal Research and Development funding as key to our economic future. It also points out that much of the current technology talent shortage Congress has been spending so much time on could be alleviated through increased R&D support, since that funding supports our technology education and training system. It is frankly unique in my Senate experience to see a letter signed by such a significant segment of our nation\\'s technology leaders and I hope the Senate will heed its counsel. \\n   This letter comes to us in the context of the recently passed Budget Resolution which calls for a small increase in federal investments in science and technology over last year\\'s levels. I believe that a strong bipartisan majority  of the Senate would agree that more is needed. Past investments in research, made in all scientific disciplines and supporting work performed in universities, industry, and government labs, have been the driving force for creating the technologies that have driven our high tech economic boom, preserved our national security, and created fantastic new advances in medical care. The Senate has recognized this, and last year passed the Federal Research Investment Act (S. 296) unanimously--legislation which had 42 bipartisan cosponsors and which calls for a doubling of funding for civilian science and technology over the next decade. \\n   I note that this year the Administration has submitted an aggressive program for civilian science investments for many key agencies, consistent with both the spirit and text of the Senate\\'s legislation, and with the points made in the letter. In particular, I want to call attention to the Administration\\'s efforts to restore balance to the federal research portfolio by aggressively funding work in the physical sciences and engineering, through programs at the National Science Foundation and Department of Energy. Consistent with the March 22nd message sent to us by our country\\'s technology leadership, I hope the Congressional Appropriations Committees will be able to support critical civilian federal Research and Development programs at least at the levels called for in the FY01 Administration Budget Request. This investment, administered by the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, Department of Energy, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and other agencies, funds university, government lab, and industrial efforts to develop the technologies that energize our economy and protect our health. \\n   I also hope the Congress will increase funding for the Department of Defense\\'s Science and Technology program--whose products are critical to our security. Defense science and technology has in the past given us the technologies--including stealth, advanced computing, the Global Positioning System, and precision munitions--that have provided our defense technology edge and led to our victories in the Gulf and Kosovo. These investments have been drastically \\n   reduced over the years--risking both our national security and our technological leadership in a variety of key physical sciences and engineering disciplines. \\n   On April 5th, I and the other members of the Senate Science and Technology Caucus had the opportunity to learn about an example of excellent federally-funded science--the fantastic new world of nanotechnology--from a group of world renowned academics and industrial researchers. Investments in nanotechnology will help create the systems that will shrink microelectronics down to the scale of atoms and molecules and create entire chemistry labs on a single computer chip, potentially leading to a technology revolution along the lines of those generated by the transistor and the Internet. One of my constituents, Professor Mark Reed of Yale University, is already taking steps to turn federal investments in fundamental nanotechnology research into technologies that will enhance our nation\\'s productivity. He recently announced the creation of a single molecule electronic switch, using a chemical process called ``self-assembly.\\'\\' A nano-scale switch is a breakthrough that may lead to huge performance improvements in digital electronics. Professor Reed has just established a new company aiming to move the integrated electronics world into the era of molecular manufacturing, by making the building blocks of computer circuits out of single molecules. \\n   But these kinds of commercial ventures and the resulting gains in productivity and economic growth that result will only occur if the federal government maintains and increases its investments in science and technology. The Internet, the Human Genome Project, the Space Shuttle, miracle drugs, and global telecommunications networks are but a few examples of what previous investments by the federal government in science and technology have generated. Current work in nanotechnology and other fields supported by sufficient and stable federal investments can also lead to developments that will affect and improve our lives in ways we cannot imagine today. Congress will soon enter the annual Appropriations cycle and I hope that our Appropriations Committee and Subcommittee leaders over the course of this session can work together in a bipartisan fashion to insure that we adequately invest in our nation\\'s technological future. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-20000425\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, the first anniversary of the Columbine massacre has been a time for great contemplation and reflection--contemplation of the horror and tragedy of that event, and reflection on what has become of the safety and security so many of us once took for granted. From Paducah, Kentucky, to Jonesboro, Arkansas, to Springfield, Oregon, to Mount Morris Township, Michigan, to Littleton, Colorado, the surreal has too often become mortally real. Senseless, horrific and seemingly random gun violence has invaded all corners of our nation. These incidents have shattered our collective sense of security. What\\'s worse, they have done so with respect to the very places where we and our children have the right to feel most secure: our schools and our places of worship. \\n   There are many facets to this problem--a media culture that desensitizes our children to violence, a feeling of hopelessness that invades too many of our children and the often too easy accessibility of firearms. We must address all of these problems, and I hope we soon will start to do so by taking action on the long-stalled juvenile justice bill with its several sensible gun-safety provisions and its measures aimed at the culture of violence surrounding our children. \\n   But there is one more thing we can do for ourselves and our children: restore a sense of sanctuary and safe haven to spaces where guns have no place. Ask parents, educators or congregants, and they\\'ll say every community is entitled to at least a few sites of sanctuary, where they can honor their families and their God without fearing for their safety or their lives. But the reality is that at least 22 states permit gun owners to carry concealed weapons into places of worship, and many allow them at school events off campus. \\n   Why does anyone other than a law enforcement or security officer need to carry a firearm into these spaces? Why at this moment of such concern about gun violence do we want to add to it the potential for more terror and tragedy in what should be our safest places? Why after at least a dozen shootings in American churches and synagogues over the last five years do we want to invite another? \\n   Making clear that guns have no place in what are supposed to be sanctuaries would put the law on the right side of reason. It would help diminish the odds that another Columbine is around the corner. And it would reassure the American people that it is possible for us to come together on common ground to fight this threat to our safety and security. \\n   With these thoughts in mind, and with the Million Mom March against gun violence soon to occur in Washington, I am today joining a coalition  of more than 25 Members in submitting a resolution expressing our support for prohibitions on firearms in schools, scholastic settings, and places of worship. This resolution would make a clear statement that, like most Americans, we in the Senate believe that Saturday Night Specials do not belong in Sunday School classes or any other place where families are learning, playing or praying. \\n   This in the end is not an ideological or constitutional issue, but a question of common sense. We can respect the rights of law-abiding gun owners while also acknowledging that bullets and Bibles don\\'t mix. This is not a hard line to take. Nor should it be a hard line to draw, in order to provide safe havens for our families. \\n   It is time for the Senate to go on record and say that there are certain places in our society that must be safe havens from even the threat of violence, spaces where we and our children can go to pray and play with the confidence that safety and security will follow. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-20000407\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to explain my opposition to the Senate Budget Committee\\'s resolution for FY2001. How unfortunate that during these great economic times, my Republican colleagues have outlined a fiscal policy that will squander our hard earned on-budget surplus on misguided economic priorities. Instead of using our on-budget surplus to make important investments for our economic future, this plan calls for large tax cuts that will devour nearly all of our on-budget surplus. Simply put, the budget we are considering today does not reflect my economic priorities of fiscal discipline and wise investment in our people in order to ensure that all Americans participate in our history\\'s greatest economic expansion. \\n   The committee\\'s budget makes unrealistic assumptions about the level of discretionary spending for the next five years and assumes that the projected surplus will materialize to pay for a large tax cut. The Budget Resolution provides for FY2001 $596 billion for total discretionary spending. When defense discretionary spending is taken out, there is a ten percent across the board cut from FY2000 spending levels. This means that important investments in our economic future will not be made. For example, 20,000 new teachers will not be hired. Subsidies and grants for school construction to 5,000 schools would be eliminated and 62,000 students will not be able to participate in Head Start. \\n   Instead, the Republican budget calls for a $150 to $200 billion tax cut over five years. When an additional $17 billion is added for servicing the larger national debt created by the tax cut, the Republican tax plan will consume at least $168 billion of the $170 billion CBO projected on-budget surplus. Moreover, at a time when the Federal Reserve is already nervous about inflation and has been raising interest rates to protect against higher inflation, a tax cut will only increase inflationary pressure. At this time of strong growth I cannot see a benefit to a tax cut other than that it serves as a consumption subsidy. \\n   By assuming unrealistic spending levels and using the surplus for a large tax cut, this budget leaves no funding for debt reduction. It only dedicates $1 billion for debt reduction in FY2001. If the on-budget surplus funds were used to service the debt, the result would be less inflationary pressure and lower interest rates--a de facto tax cut for all Americans, not just the wealthiest Americans. Paying down the debt would also reflect a commitment to fiscal discipline. After we have worked so hard to balance the budget, it seems only reasonable that it should stay balanced and that we use the surplus funds to benefit our economy not hurt it. \\n   This budget does not promote \\n   savings and reduce the growing income and wealth gaps in our economy. The budget proposed by the majority party does not take advantage of our booming economy to rectify some of our greatest economic inequalities. \\n   The economic expansion that began in April, 1991 is the longest in American history. It is now more than 9 years old and shows few signs letting up. Both inflation and unemployment remain remarkably low. The key to economic vitality, worker productivity, hit a 7 year high last year. This expansion is being fueled by combination of new and old economy fundamentals, technological innovation and fiscal discipline. \\n   Along with this phenomenal economy we would expect to see the circle of opportunity expanding to include many more Americans. But we do not. Despite this historic era of growth, we are seeing the opposite--a growing gulf between the have and have nots, with more Americans falling further behind and out of the economic mainstream. As we have celebrated continued economic successes, we have scarcely noticed a swelling opportunity gap that is as much about wealth as it is about income. \\n   Several recent studies have documented a growing income gap in the U.S.--an increasing income disparity between the rich and poor with declining incomes for both poor and low-income families. In addition to that income gap, a report released recently by the Federal Reserve Bank, has identified a significant wealth gap in this country. A gap where the net worth--or assets--of the typical American family has risen substantially since 1989, while the net worth--or assets--of lower income families has actually declined during the economic boom of recent years. \\n   According to the Fed report, families earning under $10,000 a year had a median net worth of $1,900 in 1989. That climbed to $4,800 in 1995, but had slipped back to $3,600 by 1998. Those families earning $10,000 to $25,000 saw their net worth drop from $31,000 in 1995 to $24,800 in 1998. More specifically, while the percent of all U.S. families that own a home or business has risen during the boom years of 1995-98, the percent among lower income families has decreased. For example, in 1995, 36.1% of families earning under $10,000 annually owned their home. By 1998 the rate had dropped to 34.5%. The drop for families earning $10,000 to $25,000 was from 54.9% to 51.7%. The same story is true for the percent of lower income families owning a business. Other recent studies show that this wealth gap is even more profound in certain parts of our society. We also know that wealth accumulation is generational; it runs in families. According to some studies, up to 50% of all household wealth is passed down from generation to generation. \\n   If this trend is not corrected, we are putting at risk some of the very fundamentals of the American Dream--essential values like home ownership and the small, family-owned business. But closing the wealth gap is not just an issue of opportunity and fairness. If this trend is not corrected, we also put at risk future economic growth. We must begin to question how sustainable  is our economy if its growth continues to elude so many. How many potential entrepreneurs are we leaving behind and to what extent are we limiting our future economic growth by doing so? \\n   We can take steps to address this wealth gap and expand economic opportunity. One innovative and powerful approach to help low-income, working families save and develop the assets \\n   they need to get ahead and thrive in the new economy is Individual Development Accounts, or IDAs. Similar to Individual Retirement Accounts, IDAs are incentive-based savings accounts that can be opened and used only for specific, predetermined purposes. Deposits into an IDA by an account holder are matched dollar for dollar through public and private funding. The matching funds are held in a parallel account until the account holder completes a financial education course and saves enough to purchase an asset. Low income individuals and families may use their IDA to purchase a home, start a small business, or seek postsecondary education--to pursue the American Dream. \\n   Currently, there are nearly 250 IDA programs across the country with approximately 5,000 account holders. The early evidence from these programs is convincing. It shows that IDAs are highly effective in promoting savings and asset building among the working poor. In less than two years, 1,300 account holders in the largest national IDA program saved more than $375,000 and leveraged an additional $740,000 in matching funds. Participants made an average deposit of just $33 a month. The majority of account holders are women. Twenty percent of account holders had never even held a bank account before enrolling in the IDA program. \\n   In the new economy, where job churn is the norm and individuals are increasingly responsible for funding their own retirements, wealth-building assets are rapidly becoming the main source of economic security. IDAs can give millions of low income working families, parents, their children, and future generations, an opportunity for upward mobility and economic stability. \\n   By proposing such a large and unrealistic tax cut, the majority will make it harder to resource our military at the level it will need to maintain its battlefield capability today and begin the difficult and costly process to transform the force into one that can counter the kinds of threats we are likely to see in the future. We have worked very hard over several years to raise the defense budget to ensure our soldiers, sailors, and airmen are fairly and adequately compensated for their unique and arduous sacrifices to protect our freedoms. The President has also proposed a budget that increases procurement spending to $60 billion, a level that the Quadrennial Defense Review deemed necessary in 1997, but until this year was not achievable. Indeed, the President\\'s proposed budget increases defense over the previous years\\' budget in real terms for the first time since 1985, and keeps us on a path to modernize our current force and transform it in later years. \\n   Although the rhetoric of this Resolution would increase spending over the President\\'s budget this year and in the immediate out years, we can only hope that it will allow us to transform our military over the long term because the huge tax cut that is being proposed will most likely squash our superiority in readiness and technology in the long term. As more than one military commander has noted, hope is not a method. The majority wants to provide a large tax cut and talk the talk of strong defense. Unfortunately, they will not be able to have it both ways, and given a choice, we should all vote against such a large tax cut, and walk the walk with responsible defense spending now and in the future. \\n   We are at a critical time in our society where more young people, particularly minorities and low-income individuals, are being left behind in the new economy because they are not learning the basic skills of reasoning, mathematics, and communication that provide the foundation for higher education or entry-level jobs in high tech work. The committee\\'s budget fails to invest the level of resources necessary to ensure that all of our children are adequately prepared to compete in this challenging marketplace. \\n   While more money alone won\\'t solve our problems, we cannot honestly expect to reinvent our schools without it either. The reality is that there is a tremendous need for additional investment in our public schools, not just in urban areas but in every kind of community. Not only are thousands of crumbling and overcrowded schools in need of modernization, but a looming shortage of two million new teachers to hire and train lurks on the horizon. Add to this, billions in spiraling special education costs to meet. \\n   During the upcoming debate on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act reauthorization, several of my colleagues and I will offer a reform proposal, which concentrates our national efforts on closing the achievement gap between the haves and have-nots, fostering English proficiency for immigrant children, improving the quality of teaching for all children, promoting choice and competition within the public system, and stimulating innovative and high performance educational initiatives. We would ask the states to set performance standards in each of these areas, and in exchange for the funding and flexibility, we would--for the first time ever--hold states accountable for delivering demonstrable results. \\n   The Function 300 account of the budget--the function that funds core environmental and conservation projects--contains some important increases in funding for particular programs, but suffers from the overall cuts in discretionary spending. While I support additional funding for water infrastructure projects and land management, I remain concerned that core programs of the Environmental Protection Agency are suffering unjustified cuts. Discretionary decreases can substantially undermine clean-ups at Superfund sites, review of pesticide tolerances under the Food Quality Protection Act, and ongoing work to identify air toxics. \\n   I am particularly concerned that the Senate mark includes $1.2 billion in assumed revenues from oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. These revenues are fiscally irresponsible, as drilling is not in place to bring in net receipts over the five year time frame of the budget. More importantly, I, like the majority of the American public, am opposed to drilling in the Refuge as it would irreversibly damage a critical national ecological treasure. \\n   A responsible strategy would be to set aside about one-third of the surplus during this period of growth to pay for a drug benefit, to strengthen Medicare against the future, and to address the desperate condition of many facilities in Connecticut and other states. The approach of the Republican majority saves about 2% of the on-budget surplus, and uses the rest to fund new tax breaks. \\n   If this budget passes, the Medicare program will have $331 billion less--$331 billion less to cover drug benefits for our seniors, $331 billion less to keep hospitals and nursing homes open, and $331 billion that our children will have to pay. \\n   Our past investments in research, made in all scientific disciplines and supporting work performed in universities, industry, and government labs, have been the driving force for creating the technologies that have driven our high tech economic boom, preserved our national security, and created fantastic new advances in medical care. Yet, this budget resolution calls for only a small increase in federal investments in science and technology over last year\\'s levels. This budget resolution presents a timid and incremental approach to innovation, even though the Senate has recognized the importance of research and development and last year passed the Federal Research Investment Act unanimously--which called for a doubling of funding for civilian science and technology over the next decade. \\n   Unfortunately, the small increase in the budget resolution does not match the administration\\'s aggressive program for civilian science investments, nor the spirit of the Senate\\'s own legislation, for many key agencies. In particular, I support the Administration\\'s efforts to restore balance to the federal research portfolio by aggressively funding work in the physical sciences and engineering, through programs at the National Science Foundation and Department of Energy. A number of my colleagues and I are introducing a  Sense of the Senate Resolution which calls for funding science at increasing levels each year in order to achieve a goal of doubling the federal investment in civilian R&D over an eleven year period, as well as for annually increasing funding of the Department of Defense\\'s Science and Technology program--whose products are critical to the safety of our nation\\'s warfighters. \\n   In conclusion, Mr. President, I would like to support a budget resolution that more closely reflects sound budget and economic priorities. It should be a budget plan that follows the policy of fiscal discipline and strategic investment that achieved and has sustained our current economic expansion. Unfortunately, this resolution does not and it will only lead us back into deficit. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-2-20000407\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to clarify the intent of a Sense of the Senate amendment we passed earlier today regarding the Census. That amendment, which we passed unanimously, expressed the sense of the Senate that Americans should not be prosecuted, fined or harassed for not answering certain Census questions. At the same time, the amendment expresses our encouragement that all Americans should fill out and send back their Census forms. \\n   I want to emphasize that there has not been a prosecution for failing to fill out the Census in decades. The American people should not fear the Census; we should fear an incomplete or inaccurate count due to lack of participation. The Constitution requires an enumeration of our population every 10 years. While the data the Census Bureau collects are used for purposes of apportionment of the House and redistricting, this information is also used to help determine funding for thousands of Federal, state and local programs that benefit all Americans. Moreover, the law requires Census forms to be kept confidential for 72 years--not only from the public but from all other government agencies. \\n   We should support the Census Bureau in its effort to carry out this massive task. I encourage every resident to fill out and send back his or her census form and to cooperate with census-takers or enumerators who will be in the neighborhoods in the coming weeks. I also want to make clear that the amendment is not intended to impede  census-takers or enumerators in appropriate followup actions they may need to undertake. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-20000406\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to join the distinguished Senator from Delaware in voicing my strenuous objections to opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil exploration, and in urging our colleagues not to sacrifice this natural wonder at the altar of short-term economic expediency. \\n   I recognize that ANWR is once again a tempting target at this moment of record high oil and gasoline prices and low consumer patience. Proponents of drilling, as they have many times before, hold out the promise of a quick fix to this recent price spike and a long-term solution to our dependence on foreign oil. They go so far as to portray the refuge as a kind of energy security blanket that will protect us from the whims of foreign producers. \\n   But appealing as that sounds, the truth remains that ANWR is not the answer to our current oil woes. Opening this pristine place of wilderness to drilling will not bring down gas prices months or years from now, let alone in the immediate future. And it will not yield anywhere near the amount of crude needed to successfully wean us from our addiction to OPEC in years to come. What it will do, we know from plenty of analysis and experience, is immeasurable and irreversible damage to one of the last pure preserves of its kind in the world and one of G-d\\'s most awesome creations. That is the real price at issue here, and it is far too high to pay for the modest benefit it will bring to our domestic oil supply and to those who produce it. \\n   I would suggest to my colleagues that ``modest\\'\\' is a generous characterization. The fact is that we have no guarantees about the potential recovery of oil in ANWR. More than 20 different independent and federal studies have been completed on the amount of oil in ANWR, and estimates vary wildly. One of those, completed during the Reagan Administration, determined that there was only a one in five chance of finding any commercially recoverable oil at all. More recently, an assessment by the U.S. Geological Survey estimates that 5.2 billion barrels of oil would be ``economically recoverable\\'\\' from the refuge for the rest of its life. Compared against projections of the potential for an aggressive program to produce biomass ethanol to displace oil--2.5 million barrels per day by 2030 and over 3 million per day in 2035--the oil promise of the Refuge is minuscule. The Refuge would probably never meet more than a negligible percentage of our Nation\\'s energy needs at any given time. \\n   In exchange for this minimal return, we would threaten one of the most unique animal and plant habitats in the world. Consider the fate of the Porcupine Caribou Herd, for which the Coastal Plain within the refuge is an important calving ground. An Environmental Impact Statement issued by the Interior Department in 1995 shows that development of ANWR will likely have significant negative effects on the PCH, displacing them to areas of higher predator density, reducing the amount and quality of forage species available during calving, and restricting the animals\\' access to areas where they can get relief from insects. Experts predict similar risks await polar bears, muskoxen, brown bears, snow geese, wolves, seals, and whales. \\n   That is if all goes well with the drilling, which is not a safe assumption. Data from the Alaska Department of Conservation show that the Trans-Alaska and Prudhoe Bay oil fields have caused an average of 427 spills annually since 1996. The most common spills involve crude and diesel oil, but more than 40 substances, from acid to waste oil, could be released. What is more, current oil operations in Alaska\\'s North Slope emits about 56,427 tons of nitrous oxides, which contribute to smog and acid rain, and about 24,000 tons of methane, a greenhouse gas, per year. Drilling for more oil in ANWR thus compounds the serious problem of global climate change, generating methane emissions in addition to the carbon dioxide emissions that result from increased dependence on oil resources. \\n   It is this lopsided tradeoff--uncertain dividends for likely devastation--that has generated cries of outrage from practically every environmental group every time Congress has attempted to open ANWR to drilling, generated several veto threats from President Clinton, and prompted editorials in newspapers from Seattle to Tampa to Des Moines to Atlanta questioning the wisdom of such a move. It was not right then, it\\'s not right now, and it won\\'t be right come the next price spike. \\n   Nor is it right to mislead the public into thinking a quick fix exists. The reality is we don\\'t have any easy answers to our foreign oil addiction. There is no untapped domestic oil oasis out there that will end our dependence on foreign oil and minimize our vulnerability to fluctuations of the global market. But that is not to say we are helpless. In fact, there are several steps we as a nation could take over the next year that would go a long way toward curing our OPEC addiction. \\n   The solution, I would argue to my colleagues, is nurturing alternative energy sources and improving our energy efficiency. First, we should invest more in exploring the power potential of wind and geothermal energy, fuel cells, and organic materials, and developing long-range strategies for harnessing these renewable energy sources. We have made a good start this year by passing legislation sponsored by Senator LUGAR to spur more research into harvesting energy from common crops. I hope we will build on that progress by adopting the President\\'s budget recommendation of increased funding for research, development, and deployment of renewable energy technologies by 30 percent. Second, we should take stock of the domestic energy market and evaluate national and individual consumer decisions affecting our own energy supply and efficiency. In some areas the results are encouraging. As the President has noted, conservation measures taken by U.S. businesses have significantly improved the efficiency of the overall economy. During the crisis of the 1970s, nearly nine percent of our GDP was spent on oil, compared with only three percent today. But we can and should do better. \\n   The promise of this approach was spelled out in detail by leading experts at a recent hearing held by the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. To cite just one example, Dr. John Holdren, the Director of the Program on Science, Technology, and Public Policy at Harvard University\\'s Kennedy School of Government, and Chairman of the President\\'s Committee of Advisors on Science and Technology, stated that if the U.S. increases its efficiency by 2.2 percent per year, it could reduce its dependence on oil by more than 50 percent, approximately 5.5 million barrels of oil per day. This goal is more than realistic, for as Dr. Holdren noted, the U.S. decreased its energy intensity by 1.7 percent from 1972 to 1979 and by 3.2 percent from 1979 to 1982. \\n   In short, we don\\'t have to defile the Alaskan wilderness to declare our energy independence. Assaulting ANWR is bad energy policy, it\\'s even worse environmental policy, and it\\'s simply not necessary to help the American consumer and protect our economy. For that reason, I implore my colleagues to once again stand as firm as the tundra and uphold the ban on drilling in the Arctic Refuge. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-2-20000406\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, with deference to my friend and colleague from Louisiana, I am going to be brief. \\n   Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment offered by my colleague, Senator GRAHAM. This amendment would set aside and protect $15 billion over the next five years, holding funds in reserve so that resources are available once legislation reuathorizing ESEA is enacted. The amendment adds that to qualify for funds, ESEA reauthorization must contain a few fundamental elements: (1) increased accountability; (2) the ability of States and localities to set high student performance standards; (3) the targeting of funds to the most impoverished areas and schools most in need of improvement; and (4) the concentration of Federal resources on key national goals of compensatory education for disadvantaged children, teacher quality, innovative education strategies, serving limited English proficient students, student safety, and educational technology. \\n   During the upcoming debate on ESEA, I will join with several of my colleagues in offering a new approach that meets these qualifications. It is an approach that would refocus our national policy on helping States and local school districts raise academic achievement for all children, putting the priority for Federal programs on performance instead of process, and on delivering results instead of developing rules. Our approach calls on States and local districts to enter into a new compact with the Federal Government to work together to strengthen standards and improve educational opportunities, particularly for America\\'s poorest children. It would provide States and local educators with significantly more Federal funding and significantly more flexibility in targeting aid to meet the specific needs. In exchange; it would demand real accountability, and for the first time impose consequences on schools that continually fail to show progress. \\n   In order to implement effective educational policy, we have to first recognize that there are serious problems with the performance of many public schools, and that public confidence in public education will continue to erode if we do not acknowledge and address those problems soon. While student achievement is up, we must realize the alarming achievement gap that separates minorities from whites and low-income students from their more affluent counterparts. According to the State-by-State reading scores of fourth graders on the National Assessment of Educational Progress, the achievement gap between African American and white students grew in 16 States between 1992 and 1998. The gap between Hispanic and white students grew in nine States over the same period of time. Most alarmingly, student data reveals that the average African-American and Latino 17-year-old has about the same reading and math skills as the average white 13-year-old. \\n   We must also question whether our schools are adequately preparing our youth to enter the globally competitive market place when, as one report states, ``Students are being unconsciously eliminated from the candidate pool of Information Technology (IT) workers by the knowledge and attitudes in their K-12 years. Many students do not learn the basic skills of reasoning, mathematics and communication that provide the foundation for higher education or entry-level jobs in IT work.\\'\\'  \\n   We also have to acknowledge that we have done a very good job in recent years in providing every child with a well-qualified teacher, a critical component to higher student achievement. We are failing to deliver teachers to the classroom who truly know their subject matter--one national survey found that one-fourth of all secondary school teachers did not major \\n   in their core area of instruction, and that in the school districts with the highest concentration of minorities, students have less than a 50 percent chance of getting a math or science teacher who has a license or a degree in their field. \\n   While more money alone will not solve our problems, we cannot honestly expect to reinvent our schools without it either. The reality is that there is a tremendous need for additional investment in our public schools, not just in urban areas but in every kind of community. Not only are thousands of crumbling and overcrowded schools in need of modernization, but a looming shortage of two million new teachers to hire and train lurks on the horizon. Add to this, billions in spiraling special education costs to meet. \\n   We also have to recognize the basic math of trying to raise standards at a time of profound social turbulence that we will need to expend new sums to reach and teach children who in the past we never asked to excel, and who in the present will have to overcome enormous hurdles to do so. At the same time that schools are trying to cope with new and complex societal changes, we are demanding that they teach more than they ever have before. Employers and parents alike what better teachers, stronger standards, and higher test scores for all students, as well as state-of-the-art technology and skills to match. \\n   It is a tribute to the many dedicated men and women who are responsible for teaching our children that the bulk of our schools are as good as they are, in light of these intensifying pressures. I believe any child can learn--any child--and that has been proven over and over again in the best schools in both my home state of Connecticut and in many of America\\'s cities. \\n   There are, in fact, plenty of positives to highlight in public education today, which is something else that we have to acknowledge, yet too often do not. I have made a concerted effort over the last few years to visit a broad range of schools and programs in Connecticut, and I can tell you that there is much happening in our public schools that we can be heartened by, proud of, and learn from. \\n   There is the exemplary John Barry Elementary School in Meriden, CT, which has to contend with a high-poverty, high-mobility student population, but through intervention programs has had real success improving the reading skills of many of its students. In addition, there is the Side by Side Charter School in Norwalk, one of 17 charter schools in Connecticut, which has created an exemplary multiracial program in response to the challenge of Sheff v. O\\'Neill to diminish racial isolation. Side by Side is experimenting with a different approach to classroom assignments, having students stay with teachers for two consecutive years to take advantage of the relationships that develop, and by all indications it is working quite well for those kids. \\n   And there is the BEST program, which, building on previous efforts to raise teacher skills and salaries, is now targeting additional state aid, training, and mentoring support to help local districts nurture new teachers and prepare them to excel. The result is that Connecticut\\'s blueprint is touted by some, including the National Commission on Teaching and America\\'s Future, as a national model for others to follow. \\n   A number of other States, led by Texas and North Carolina, are moving in this same direction--refocusing their education systems not on process but on performance, not on prescriptive rules and regulations but on results. More and more of them are in fact adopting what might be called a ``reinvest, reinvent, and responsibility\\'\\' strategy, by (1) infusing new resources into their public education systems; (2) giving local districts more flexibility; and (3) demanding new measures and mechanisms of accountability, to increase the chances that these \\n   investments will yield the intended return, meaning improved academic achievement for all students. \\n   To ensure that more States and localities have the ability to build on these successes and prepare student to succeed in the classroom, we must invest more resources. That is why we would boost ESEA funding by $35 billion over the next five years. But we also believe that the impact of this funding will be severely diluted if it is not better targeted to the worst-performing schools and if it is not coupled with a demand for results. That is why we not only increase Title I funding by 50 percent, but use a more targeted formula for distributing these new dollars to schools with the highest concentrations of poverty. And that is why we develop a new accountability system that strips federal funding from states that continually fail to meet their performance goals. \\n   We also agree with those concerned with the current system that federal education programs are too numerous and too bureaucratic. That is why we eliminate dozens of federally microtargeted, micromanaged programs that are redundant or incidental to our core mission of raising academic achievement. But we also believe that we have a great national interest in promoting broad national educational goals, chief among them delivering on the promise of equal opportunity. It is not only foolish, however, but irresponsible to hand out federal dollars with no questions asked and no thought of national priorities. That is why we carve out separate titles in those areas that we think are critical to helping local districts elevate the performance of their schools. \\n   The first would enhance our longstanding commitment to providing extra help to disadvantaged children through the title I program, while better targeting $12 billion in aid--a 50 percent increase in funding--to schools with the highest concentrations of poor students. The second would combine various teacher training and professional development programs into a single teacher quality grant, increase funding by 100 percent to $1.6 billion annually, and challenge each state to pursue the kind of bold, performance-based reforms that my own state of Connecticut has undertaken with great success. \\n   The third would reform the Federal bilingual education program and hopefully defuse the ongoing controversy surrounding it by making absolutely clear that our national mission is to help immigrant children learn and master English, as well as achieve high levels of achievement in all subjects. We must be willing to back this commitment with essential resources required to help ensure that all limited English proficient students are served. \\n   Under our approach, funding for LEP programs would be more than doubled to $1 billion a year, and for the first time be distributed to states and local districts through a reliable formula, based on their LEP student population. As a result, school districts serving large LEP and high poverty student populations would be guaranteed federal funding, and would not be penalized because of their inability to hire savvy proposal writers for competitive grants. \\n   The fourth would respond to the public demands for greater choice within the public school framework, by providing additional resources for charter school start-ups and new incentives for expanding local, intradistrict choice programs. And the fifth would radically restructure the remaining ESEA and ensure that funds are much better targeted while giving local districts greater flexibility in addressing specific needs. We consolidate more than 20 different programs into a single High Performance Initiatives title, with a focus on supporting bold new ideas, expanding access to summer school and after school programs, improving school safety, \\n   and building technological literacy. We increase overall funding by more than $200 million, and distribute this aid through a formula that targets more resources to the highest poverty areas. \\n   The boldest change we are proposing is to create a new accountability title. As of today, we have plenty of rules and requirements on inputs, on how funding is to be allocated and who must be served, but little if any attention to outcomes, on how schools ultimately perform in educating children. This bill would reverse that imbalance  by linking Federal funding to the progress States and local districts make in raising academic achievement. It would call on State and local leaders to set specific performance standards and adopt rigorous assessments for measuring how each district is faring in meeting those goals. In turn, States that exceed those goals would be rewarded with additional funds, and those that fail repeatedly to show progress would be penalized. In other words, for the first time, there would be consequences for poor performance. \\n   In discussing how exactly to impose those consequences, we have run into understandable concerns about whether you can penalize failing schools without also penalizing children. The truth is that we are punishing many children right now, especially the most vulnerable of them, by forcing them to attend chronically troubled schools that are accountable to no one, a situation that is just not acceptable anymore. This bill minimizes the potential negative impact of these consequences on students. It provides the States with three years to set their performance-based goals and put in place a monitoring system for gauging how local districts are progressing, and also provides additional resources for States to help school districts identify and improve low-performing schools. If after those three years a State is still failing to meet its goals, the State would be penalized by cutting its administrative funding by 50 percent. Only after 4 years of under performance would dollars targeted for the classroom be put in jeopardy. At that point, protecting kids by continuing to subsidize bad schools becomes more like punishing them. \\n   I must address another concern that may be raised that this is a block grant in sheep\\'s clothing. There are substantial differences between a straight block-grant approach and this streamlined structure. First, in most block-grant proposals the accountability mechanisms are vague, weak and often non-existent, which is one reason why I have opposed them in the Senate. Our bill would have tangible consequences, pegged not just to raise test scores in the more affluent suburban areas, but to closing the troubling achievement gap between students in poor, largely minority districts and their better-off peers. \\n   It is a commonsense strategy--reinvest in our public schools, reinvent the way we administer them, and restore a sense of responsibility to the children we are supposed to be serving. Hence the title of our bill: the Public Education Reinvention, Reinvestment, and Responsibility Act, or the Three Rs for short. Our approach is humble enough to recognize there are no easy answers to turning around low-performing schools, to lifting teaching standards, to closing the debilitating achievement gap, and that most of those answers won\\'t be found here in Washington anyway. But it is ambitious enough to try to harness our unique ability to set the national agenda and recast the federal government as an active catalyst for success instead of a passive enabler of failure. \\n   I am pleased to support the Graham amendment which will ensure we have the necessary resources in reserve to provide for the kind of education reform that I have outlined. Reauthorization of the status quo is not the answer. We need real reform that concentrates resources around central national goals, targets those resources to the most impoverished areas and schools in greatest need, and holds States and localities to a new, higher standard of accountability for results in raising student academic achievement. \\n   I am pleased to support the Graham amendment which will ensure we have the necessary resources in reserve to provide for the kind of education reform that I have outlined.

We need real reform that concentrates resources around central national goals, targets those resources to the most impoverished areas and schools in greatest need, and holds States and localities to a new, higher standard of accountability for results in raising student academic achievement. \\n   I am very grateful for the strong statements that have been made by my colleagues in support of this amendment by Senator GRAHAM. This amendment is, in a sense, our first statement of support for a major reform of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which we intend to offer when that act comes before the Senate in May. \\n   There are two facts to state about the Federal role in education and what is happening throughout the country. \\n   The first is that we have not achieved what the ESEA was adopted to achieve in 1965, and that is to close the academic achievement gap between advantaged and disadvantaged children. The proposal that I will offer, along with Senators BAYH, LANDRIEU, LINCOLN, KOHL, GRAHAM, ROBB, and BREAUX, is aimed at investing more money in the education of disadvantaged children while giving local authorities the flexibility to set achievement goals and decide what they think is the best way to achieve them, and then to hold them accountable for producing measurable results. It will reward those who succeed and, for the first time ever, impose real consequences on those who do not. \\n   The second reality in American education today is that there are also cases of magnificent reform happening at the local and State level, which we must recognize. These success stories include many of the same elements--more accountability, more innovation, more public school choice, higher teaching standards, and superb work by great teachers and school administrators. \\n   Our proposal will streamline more than 40 current ESEA programs into five performance-based grants that will support and expand these reform efforts that are occurring at the grassroots level in America. It is a common sense proposal built upon the core principles of reinvestment, reinvention, and responsibility that will finally provide the full, decent, and equal education we want for all our children, and the educational reform that our children need. \\n   I thank my friend and colleague from Florida for offering this amendment. We have a very strong working group in favor of reform. We hope this proposal not only represents innovation and change that will be a catalyst for broad-scale national education reform, but that it will constitute a bridge on which Members of both parties can meet in the Senate to accomplish the most sweeping reform of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act in its 35-year history. \\n   I thank the Chair and my friend from Nevada, and particularly my patient and learned friend from Louisiana. I yield the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-20000405\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague. \\n   I am delighted in the midst of this debate on the budget, which sometimes lacks exhilaration, to interject, along with our friends from Michigan, a note of euphoria. This euphoria, of course, is of the basketball variety. \\n   We are just days removed from the completion of that exhilarating spring spectacle we\\'ve come to know as March Madness--the National Collegiate Athletic Association Basketball Tournament. And here in the Nation\\'s Capital, Senator DODD and I are very fortunate and proud to be establishing a spring rite of our own: coming to the floor on behalf of grateful fans across \\n   Connecticut--and we would like to think admiring fans across America--to praise the incomparable University of Connecticut Huskies, last year\\'s men\\'s team and this year\\'s women\\'s team champions of the basketball world once more. \\n   With this victory on Sunday night defeating archrival Tennessee 71 to 52, the women Huskies not only earned their second national championship in 5 years, they also managed to set a school record for wins with 36 and to overcome what was their only loss in an otherwise perfect season to a very good Tennessee Volunteer team. \\n   As just one measure of the University of Connecticut\\'s captivating run to the championship, four of the five players named to the All-Tournament team were Huskies, including the tournament\\'s Most Valuable Player--the extraordinary and indomitable Shea Ralph. \\n   In celebrating this tremendous achievement, we are particularly proud of our National Coach of the Year, Geno Auriemma, for whom victory served on Sunday night as something of a triumphant homecoming. Geno was raised in the steel mill town of Norristown on the outskirts of Philly by his parents who brought him and his family from their country of birth, which was Italy. He was accompanied to Sunday\\'s game by his mother, Marsiella, who watched from the stands. And, as anybody who watched the game on television learned, she was holding a jar of holy water in her lap, which she sprinkled on Connecticut\\'s players for good luck. \\n   They responded by playing what I would have to call a divinely inspired game. \\n   It was, if you saw the game, one of those occasions when everything seems to come together and go right. It was an extraordinary experience for those of us who are the fans of this team. \\n   On Monday, as the dawn came, people across Connecticut bore witness to a spectacle that I think few fans of women athletics could have envisioned when Congress first passed title IX in 1972. Across the State, from Danbury to Dayville, from Stamford to Stonington, communities came together and exalted in the accomplishments of this great Huskies team, a celebration equal in intensity to the one sparked by the men\\'s championship last year. The Hartford Courant thought so much of the Husky victory that it dedicated its entire front page to their win, and it says it in one word. Here is a great picture of our coach, Geno Auriemma, doing his impersonation of Alan Keyes in the mosh pit --in this case, the team holding our triumphant coach. The one word which expresses our attitude in Connecticut about this great team is ``euphoria.\\'\\'  \\n   Huskymania, we have come to learn, is an equal opportunity experience. In the town of Storrs, the picturesque, wooded hamlet that the University of Connecticut students, faculty, and administrators call home, more than 5,000 people turned out Monday for a midday pep rally of appreciation at the Gampel Pavilion, where sellout crowds watched this great team work their magic all year long. As the celebration grew more and more boisterous and enthusiastic, it seemed hard to believe that this was the same part of our State that used to be called ``The Forgotten Corner,\\'\\' because these days, if you follow college basketball, it is an awfully hard place to forget. \\n   The fact is, thanks to the Huskies, Storrs is home to the stars now. We like to think of it as the ``College Hoops Capital \\n   of America. \\n   Last year, when we came to the floor to celebrate the men\\'s victory, I closed with an impersonation of a University of Connecticut cheerleader. I was advised by many people, including my dear friend and senior colleague, not to repeat this performance. But you know that I feel it would be unfair. So very briefly, U-C-O-N-N, UConn. \\n   Thank you. I yield the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-2-20000405\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. The Senator, let it be known, was one of my role models. I compliment him. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-20000404\\n\\n    Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a man who, for 45 years, has served the Greater Hartford community with honor and distinction. On April 9, 2000 the friends of Beth Hillel Synagogue will mark the retirement of Rabbi Philip Lazowski at a dinner celebration in his honor. \\n   Since accepting the position of Spiritual Leader at Congregation Beth Sholom in 1955, Rabbi Lazowski has helped the families of his congregation find strength through the principles of faith, humility, determination, forgiveness, and service. As the congregation has grown to include hundreds of families and take the name Beth Hillel Synagogue, Rabbi Lazowski has continued to impart his wisdom on these principles with the same energy and enthusiasm that has been his trademark. Through a number of books and interfaith efforts, Rabbi Lazowski has earned a lofty position within the state\\'s distinguished history of spiritual leaders. \\n   A survivor of the Holocaust, Rabbi Lazowski has also left his mark on the countless young people across the region who have heard him speak about his childhood in Poland during World War II. From the town of Belitza to the Dvorets ghetto to more than a year of hiding in the woods, his story has resonated within the youth of the community. With his many talks and presentations on this dark chapter of human history, Rabbi Lazowski has embraced his obligation to history and has proven that the light of truth can dispel all shadow. \\n   For more than a quarter century, Rabbi Lazowski has served as Chaplain for the Hartford Police Department and has recently been named Chaplain for the Connecticut State Senate. His commitment to the spiritual health, not only of his congregation but all of the Greater Hartford area, is truly beyond question. Although he will be retiring from his position as Spiritual Leader of Beth Hillel Synagogue, I have every confidence that he will remain active as leader, educator and friend to the people of Connecticut. \\n   Rabbi Lazowski stands as a shining example of the type of selfless individual that keeps our communities vibrant. It is with great pleasure that I formally extend to him my very best wishes on this special day.  \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-20000404\\n\\n    Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor one of the oldest military organizations in the United States, founded even before our country became a unified nation; the Second Company Governor\\'s Foot Guard of New Haven. Later this week the men and women of the Second Company will celebrate their 225th anniversary which is truly a monumental observance in this first year of the new millennium. \\n   Mr. President, let me share with you the history of the Second Company because it is essentially, the history of the new nation and the colonies that became the United States of America. The first meeting of the yet to be named military organization was during the winter of 1774 and included many men whose names are known to every student who has studied American history; Benedict Arnold, Ethan Allen and Aaron Burr. Later that winter, on March 2, 1775, fifty eight men signed a memorial to form themselves into a military company. At that time, the General Assembly of the Governor and Colony of Connecticut was sitting in New Haven and made this memorial special business. On that same day, recognizing the importance and significance of this memorial, the General Assembly granted a charter to the Second Company Governor\\'s Foot Guard. It didn\\'t take long for the Second Company Governor\\'s Foot Guard to see action when, at the beginning of the American Revolution, under the command of Captain Benedict Arnold, the Second Company answered the Lexington Alarm, seized the stores of gunpowder at the Town of New Haven and marched to the Siege of Boston. The date was April 22, 1775, and each year the Second Company Governor\\'s Foot Guard performs a colorful reenactment of this event on Powder House Day in New Haven. \\n   Three years later, during the British invasion on July 2, 1779, Captain Hezekiah Sabin and the Second Company Governor\\'s Foot Guard defended New Haven at the bridge over the West River. Time and again our nation has been defended by the Second Company Governor\\'s Foot Guard. In 1861 the Second Company formed a war company which was known as the Company K, Sixth Connecticut Volunteers, left for the front in the Civil War, and fought in twenty six battles and skirmishes before being mustered out in August of 1865. \\n   Since 1775, the Second Company Governor\\'s Foot Guard has been escort to every Governor of the Colony and the State of Connecticut and has served as honor guard to fourteen American Presidents and in our Bicentennial Year, the Queen of England. Mr. President, were it not for the dedicated service of the Second Company, Governor\\'s Foot Guard for the past 225 years, I dare say the history of Connecticut, the Constitution State, as well as the United States of America would be different. Every one of us in this Chamber owes a debt of gratitude to the Second Company, Governor\\'s Foot Guard. As the Second Company celebrates 225 years of service, under the leadership of Major Commandant Peter A. Wasilewski, I rise in humble thanks to the hundreds of men and women who have proudly worn the red coat uniform and to those who will in the future. I ask those in this Chamber to join me in honoring the Second Company Governor\\'s Foot Guard for 225 years of service to the Governor, the General Assembly and the people of the Colony and State of Connecticut.  \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-20000330\\n\\n    Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Cardinal Kung, who passed away on March 12 in Stamford, CT, at the age of 98. Cardinal Kung was a historic figure in the Roman Catholic Church and a symbol of strength and hope for all of us who care about religious freedom. In China, his native land, the Cardinal endured terrible persecution because of his unwillingness to surrender his religious beliefs. My state, Connecticut, had the great honor and privilege of welcoming him as a resident for the final years of his life. \\n   Born in Shanghai in 1901, and ordained a priest in 1930, Cardinal Kung\\'s heroic story began soon after the Communists took power in China. In 1949, he became the Bishop of Shanghai and, in 1950, the Apostolic Administrator of Soochow and Nanking. Resisting the new regime\\'s attempt to control the Catholic Church, he refused to join the government-sanctioned Catholic Patriotic Association, which cut ties to the Vatican. Instead, Cardinal Kung remained loyal to the Pope and led the devoutly Catholic Legion of Mary, which the Communists declared to be counter-revolutionary. \\n   After 5 years of tension, the Chinese Government in 1955 arrested Cardinal Kung and several hundred other people involved in the unofficial Catholic Church. Dragged into a stadium in Shanghai for a public confession, the Cardinal, with his hands tied behind his back, instead courageously shouted: ``long live Christ the King, long live the Pope.\\'\\' The security forces rushed him off the stage, and Cardinal Kung was held in detention for another 5 years. When he was finally brought to trial in 1960, the authorities convicted Cardinal Kung and sentenced him to life imprisonment for the so-called counter-revolutionary activity of pursuing his Catholic faith. \\n   Cardinal Kung was a prisoner of conscience whose plight became known around the world. He suffered 30 years of isolating imprisonment, during which time he was denied visits from family and concerned representatives of the international community, and other forms of contact such as written correspondence. Despite this tortuous experience, he refused to renounce his beliefs or give in to his oppressors. In fact, when told that he could win his release by denouncing the Pope and cooperating with the government-sanctions Catholic Patriotic Association, he responded: ``I am a Roman Catholic Bishop. If I denounce the Holy Father, not only would I not be a Bishop, I would not even be a Catholic. You can cut off my head, but you can never take away my duties.\\'\\' The Vatican has recognized Cardinal Kung\\'s extraordinary devotion and sacrifice to the Roman Catholic Church. In 1979, while he was still serving his life sentence, Pope John Paul II secretly elevated Kung to Cardinal, in pectore (in his heart), and the Pope announced this to the world in 1991. \\n   In 1985, after sustained pressure from his family, human rights organizations, and foreign governments, the Chinese Government moved Cardinal Kung to house arrest, and in 1987 finally released him, though they notably did not exonerate him. He soon traveled to the United States for medical treatment and lived with his nephew, Joseph Kung, in Connecticut. In 1998, the Chinese Government refused to renew Cardinal Kung\\'s passport, effectively exiling him, and the Cardinal never returned to his country. \\n   Cardinal Kung\\'s life demonstrates, I believe, the power of an individual\\'s  faith and will to resist the repression of the state, and thus replenish the wellspring of human liberty for others. He refused to bend, to abandon his commitment to his Church, and his example inspired millions of his countrymen to hold firm in their beliefs and to their rights. When the Communists took power, there were an estimated 3 million Roman Catholics in China. According to current Chinese government statistics, there are now 4 million persons registered with the official Catholic Church. However, according to China\\'s unofficial Catholic Church, for whom Cardinal Kung was the greatest symbol, the number of underground Catholics has swelled to as many as 9-10 million. \\n   It is no secret that religious persecution in China, including of underground Catholics, continues. It is my hope that the spirit of Cardinal Kung will endure and continue to inspire others in China and around the world to follow his courageous example. And that one day there will be the complete religious freedom in China that Cardinal Kung lived, worked, and prayed for.  \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-20000330\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Estuary Habitat Restoration Partnership Act, S. 835. When our late colleague, Senator John Chafee, introduced this bill, he did so because he understood the tremendous importance of estuaries to our national economy and environment. At the same time, Senator Chafee was concerned about the considerable challenges the nation\\'s estuaries face, such as habitat loss, concentration of upstream pollutants, and coastal development. S. 835 would enable us to move forward as a nation in addressing those challenges, and I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill. \\n   Mr. President, I am particularly happy to be here today because this legislation, if passed, would have a real impact on the estuary nearest and dearest to my own heart, the Long Island Sound. Title 3 of the bill reauthorizes the Long Island Sound Office through 2005 and significantly increases the funding authorization. Last fall, with the Connecticut and New York delegations, I introduced S. 1632 to reauthorize the Office and provide significant new funding to implement critical conservation and restoration projects which will directly improve the health of the Sound. I am grateful to my colleagues for including that reauthorization in the Estuary Habitat Restoration Partnership Act. \\n   Having grown up on the coast of Connecticut, I am well aware of the importance of Long Island Sound to the region\\'s economic health and quality of life. Water-quality-dependent activities such as commercial and recreational fishing, boating, and swimming contribute an estimated $5 billion to the regional economy each year. The Sound is the leading producer of oysters along the east coast. In addition, despite the many industrial facilities and residential developments along its shoreline, the Sound is recognized nationally for its distinctive habitat types, including tidal wetlands, tidal flats, beaches, dunes, bluffs, rocky tidal areas, eelgrass, kelp beds, and natural and artificial reefs. \\n   However, the Sound does experience many of the same challenges as other estuaries--residential, commercial, and industrial development have increased pollution and removed or altered habitat, and excess nutrients have resulted in low levels of dissolved oxygen in the waters of the Sound. \\n   The Long Island Sound estuary program predated the National Estuary Program (NEP). As early as 1985, Congress recognized Long Island Sound as a national treasure when it appropriated funding for the Long Island Sound Study to research, monitor, and assess the water quality of the Sound. When the National Estuary Program was created in 1987, the Long Island Sound became a charter member. In the intervening years, Federal and state government, business, labor, environmental groups, and local communities in Connecticut and New York have come together to make a significant commitment to cleaning up the Sound. More recently, in 1994, the Governors of Connecticut and New York and the Administrator of the EPA jointly adopted the Long Island Sound Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan (CCMP) which incorporated the results of the Long Island Sound Study. Since 1985, Federal, state, and private funds have been well spent on researching the existing conditions of the Sound and identifying conservation and restoration needs. \\n   These efforts bode well for the health of the Long Island Sound; however, much work remains to be done. Last fall, the Long Island Sound lobster fishery experienced a severe die-off, with losses in some ports as high as 90 percent. Preliminary research suggests that a combination of environmental stresses may have caused this dramatic collapse. \\n   The time has come to move from identifying to implementing the conservation and restoration projects which will directly improve the water quality and habitat of the Long Island Sound. The Estuary Habitat Restoration Partnership Act would help make this possible by leveraging on-the-ground restoration work with Federal funding and by creating market-based incentives for the private sector to work with community-based organizations and local governments on restoration efforts. This is an important  bill for my state and our country, and I look forward to seeing it pass this body. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-20000329\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President. I rise today to explain my vote on the Flag Amendment. This is one of the most difficult votes I will have to cast during my tenure in the United States Senate. Words cannot fully express the anger I feel towards those who desecrate the American Flag. The Flag is a symbol of what is great about our country. It is the standard we rally around in war and in peace, in mourning and in celebration and, ultimately, in life and in death. It unites us in our past and in our future. When someone desecrates the Flag, they in a sense strike at all of those things. \\n   It is because I find desecrating the Flag to be so abhorrent and despicable an act, that I will, as I have in the past, support using any statutory means possible to prohibit Flag desecration. But after thinking long and hard about this issue, I have decided that I will again vote against this constitutional amendment. Although I recognize that a statute cannot do the whole job, I cannot vote to amend the Constitution\\'s Bill of Rights for the first time ever in a manner that would restrict, rather than expand, individual liberties. In my view, however great a symbol the Flag is, our Constitution and its Bill of Rights are all that and more. More than a symbol of liberty, they are liberty\\'s real guardian and its true protector. They are not only what unites us, but also what keeps our more than 200-year-old experiment in self-government working. They are the best the Founders of this great nation left to us--a lasting testament to the Framers\\' brilliant insight that for any people to remain truly free and capable of self-government, that there must be some limits to what the State can do to regulate the speech and political behavior of its citizens. The Flag is an important symbol, but the Bill of Rights is what the Flag symbolizes. We must be extremely cautious in altering the freedoms that this great document guarantees, lest we diminish the ideals for which our Flag stands. \\n   My former colleague Senator John Glenn--an individual whose patriotism and love of country none could doubt--expressed this view well when he submitted a statement to the Judiciary Committee last April. He explained:  \\n   The flag is the nation\\'s most powerful and emotional symbol. It is our most sacred symbol. And it is our most revered symbol. But it is a symbol. It symbolizes the freedoms that we have in this country, but it is not the freedoms themselves. That is why this debate is not between those who love the flag on the one hand and those we do not on the other. No matter how often some try to indicate otherwise, everyone on both sides of this debate loves and respects the flag. The question is, how best to honor it and at the same time not take a chance of defiling what it represents.  \\n   As General Colin Powell also recently so well put it: ``I would not amend that great shield of democracy to hammer a few miscreants. The flag will be flying proudly long after they have slunk away.\\'\\' \\n   Of course I do not believe that our Constitution or its Bill of Rights must remain forever unaltered. But the importance of the Bill of Rights requires us to establish an exceedingly high threshold for agreeing to any amendment. For me, that threshold lies at the point where an amendment is shown to be necessary to address some extreme threat to the Republic or redress some outrageous wrong. In this case, abhorrent though Flag desecration may be, it simply does not meet that threshold. \\n   I know that this is an issue that many feel passionately about. Many of my constituents have brought their views on this issue to me, and I would like to take just a couple of minutes to address some of the arguments they have made. \\n   I have heard it argued that a vote for this amendment is merely a vote to let the People--through their state legislatures--decide the issue. Those who make this argument point to polls showing that as much as 75 to 80 percent of the American public support  the amendment. It frankly is unclear whether support is all that high. I have seen polls showing that a majority of Americans opposed the amendment when they knew that it would be the first in our nation\\'s history to restrict our First Amendment freedoms of speech and expression. But more importantly, a decision on an issue as important as this one should not be made on the basis of polling. It is precisely because of the caution the Framers meant us to use in amending the Constitution, that they required supermajorities of both Houses of Congress as well as of the State legislatures to give their assent before our nation\\'s foundational document could be altered. The Senate was never meant to serve as a rubber stamp in this process, and so I owe it to the People of Connecticut, who have elected me to use my best judgment, to carefully consider issues before me, and to vote the way I believe to be correct. \\n   Some also have suggested that it is not this Amendment that would be changing the Bill of Rights or the First Amendment--that it was instead the Supreme Court that did that when, in 1989, it overturned 200 years of precedent and found Flag desecration to be protected by the First Amendment. The history of this issue is more complicated than that. Most importantly, it\\'s just not correct to say that the Supreme Court reversed 200 years of precedent. The first state Flag statute apparently was not enacted until the end of the 19th Century, and there was no federal Flag statute until 1968. Moreover, it\\'s not really fair to say that the Supreme Court reversed any of its precedents in 1989, because before the 1989 Texas v. Johnson case, the Supreme Court never addressed this issue head on. In fact, in a number of cases throughout the 20th Century dealing with people who treated the Flag in a manner that offended others, the Supreme Court repeatedly either held the conduct to be protected by the First Amendment or found other reasons to overturn the convictions. For that reason, despite dicta in some of these cases distinguishing them from pure Flag desecration, the dissent in Johnson had to acknowledge that ``Our prior cases dealing with flag desecration statutes have left open the question that the Court resolves today.\\'\\' 491 U.S. 397, 432. \\n   I must conclude that, abhorrent and despicable as I find desecrating the Flag to be, I cannot vote to support this amendment. In the end, Flag desecration is hateful and worthy of condemnation, but I just cannot conclude that it threatens the Republic. For that reason, although I stand ready to support any statutory means possible to curtail desecration of the Flag, I just cannot support amending our nation\\'s foundational document to address it. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-20000328\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to explain my vote on Senator HOLLINGS\\' proposal to amend the Constitution to allow Congress and the States to impose reasonable limits on contributions and expenditures made to support or oppose candidates for elected office. In this case, I believe that the high threshold I have established for supporting a constitutional amendment--that it address a significant threat to the Republic or some egregious wrong--has been met. \\n   This amendment addresses an unfortunate fact whose truth has become more and more apparent in the past several years: money and the never ending chase for it are threatening the integrity of our political system and jeopardizing the essence of our democracy. Although money has always played a role in American politics, its impact became overwhelming during the last few election cycles. Political fundraising and spending during the 1996 campaign was 73 percent greater than during the 1992 campaign, and there is no reason to believe we won\\'t break that record in 2000. We are all intimately familiar with the time and resources we need to spend to raise that money, and with the numerous questionable events and actions that were spurred by the money chase during the last Presidential election. Most of those events and actions, I have sadly concluded, were legal under our current campaign finance laws. But that does not mean they were not wrong. I think they were. By ensuring that we will be able to put a limit on the amount of money spent in political campaigns, this constitutional amendment would help restore a sense of integrity--and of sanity--to our campaign finance system and to our democracy. \\n   Much of the debate over this proposed amendment centers on what some call its threat to the principle of free speech. That, of course, is a principle we all hold dear. But I say, Mr. President, that free speech is not what is at issue here. Free speech is about the inalienable right all of us have to express our views without government interference. It is about the vision the Framers of our Constitution enshrined in that most important of documents--a vision that ensures that we in Congress will never compromise our American birthright to say things and offer opinions even when those opinions are unpopular or discomforting. But that simply is not at issue here, Mr. President--absolutely nothing in this amendment will do anything to diminish or threaten any American\\'s right to express his or her views about candidates running for office or about any problem or issue in American life. \\n   What would be threatened by this proposed Constitutional amendment, Mr. President, is something entirely different: the ever increasing and disproportionate power those with money have over our political system. As everyone in this chamber knows, the spiraling costs of running for office require all of us to spend more and more time raising money and more and more time with those who give it. We are all far too familiar with events or meetings with elected officials attended only by those who could afford to give $5,000 or $10,000 or even $100,000--sums of money that are beyond the capacity of the overwhelming \\n   majority of Americans to give. That, Mr. President, is threatening a principle all of us hold just as dearly as the principle of free speech: the principle of democracy. That sacred principle guides our Republic--it promises that each person has one vote, and that each and every one of us--rich or poor--has an equal right and an equal ability to influence the workings of our government. As it stands now, Mr. President, it is that sacred principle that is under attack and that sacred principle that promises to remain under attack unless we do something to save it. And that something, I submit, is campaign finance reform. \\n   I, for one, believe that most of the campaign finance reform we need can and must be done even without this Constitutional amendment. The Supreme Court, after all, has made quite clear in its decisions that even under its view of money as being equivalent to speech, the Constitution still allows Congress to impose restrictions on the amount that can be contributed to campaigns and parties. This, in my view, means that we have no excuse not to act right now to stop the massive soft money contributions that pose the biggest threat to our system. It is important that we not use the First Amendment as a shield against change because it is clearly constitutional to limit and regulate contributions to political campaigns--including soft money. \\n   What it appears we cannot do under the Supreme Court\\'s rulings is limit the amount of money we and others spend in the course of campaigns unless we adopt convoluted legislation geared toward complying with the Supreme Court\\'s view that money is  speech. I think that the need for reform is so great that it is worth accepting convoluted legislation, but I also think that we should act now to vote for this amendment and so ensure that in the future we will be able to properly regulate campaign spending, thereby controlling the amount of money spent in American political campaigns. \\n   Mr. President, nothing less than the future of our democracy is at stake here. Unless we act to reform our campaign finance system, people with money will continue to have disproportionate influence in our system, people who are not even citizens of the United States will try to use money to influence our government\\'s decisions, the American people will continue to lose faith in our government\\'s institutions, and the genius of our Republic--that it is our citizenship, not our pocketbook, that gives each of us equal power to play a role in our country\\'s governance--that genius will be lost. \\n   Mr. President, it is for that reason that I have concluded that this is one of those rare constitutional amendments that is worth supporting. Our current campaign finance system poses an egregious threat to our Democracy. Big money donations, endless spending and the proliferation of anonymously-funded and often inaccurate attack ads all have had an extraordinarily corrosive and distorting affect on our political system and on the citizenry\\'s view of its role in our Democracy\\'s decisions. I frankly can think of few threats to the Republic greater than one that throws into doubt the integrity and well-functioning of our democratic decision-making process. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-20000328\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senators THOMPSON, VOINOVICH, BROWNBACK and ROTH today to introduce the Government for the 21st Century Act. This bill provides an opportunity to address the challenges our government will face in the new millennium. Our country is undergoing rapid changes--changes brought about by technological advancements, by our expanding and increasingly global economy, and by the new and more diverse threats to our nation and our world. It is essential for our government to be prepared to respond effectively to these challenges. \\n   We should take the opportunity now to rethink the structure of our government to be sure it can meet the needs of our citizens in the years to come. The Commission that will be established under this bill will have a critical task--to study the current shape of our government and to make recommendations about how we can improve its efficiency and effectiveness, streamline its operations, and eliminate unnecessary duplication. \\n   I view the bill we are introducing today as a discussion draft. Our goal is to hear from a wide range of experts on government and management. I look  forward to reviewing new ideas that will enhance the value of the Commission\\'s work. For example, I intend to recommend that the Commission focuses on the enormous potential benefit of ``E-government.\\'\\' The Commission should consider how government can be restructured to promote the innovative use of information technology. American citizens increasingly expect services and information to be provided electronically through Internet-based technology. While the federal government is working to take advantage of the opportunities technology presents to do its job better, more needs to be done to fully integrate these capabilities and to offer services and information to Americans in a more accessible and cost-effective way. \\n   I look forward to working with Senators THOMPSON, BROWNBACK, ROTH and VOINOVICH on this important legislation. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-20000321\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a new plan for Federal education spending to refocus our national education policy on helping states and local school districts raise academic achievement for all children, putting the priority for federal programs on performance instead of process, and on delivering results instead of developing rules. \\n   In broad terms, the public Education Reinvestment, Reinvention, and Responsibility Act--better known as the ``Three R\\'s\\'\\'--calls on states and local districts to enter into a new compact with the federal government to work together to strengthen standards and improve educational opportunities, particularly for America\\'s poorest children. It would provide states and local educators with significantly more federal funding and significantly more flexibility in targeting aid to meet their specific needs. In exchange, it would demand real accountability, and for the first time consequences on schools that continually fail to show progress. \\n   From my visits with parents, teachers, and principals over this past year, it is clear that we as a nation still share a common love for the common school, for its egalitarian mission, for its democratizing force, and for its unmatched role in helping generation  after generation rise and shine. Unfortunately, we are asking schools to do more than they were designed to do, to compensate for disengaged parents and divided communities--for instructing teenage girls on how to raise their children while they try to raise the GPAs, to nourishing the bodies and psyches of grade-schoolers who often begin the day without breakfast or affection, to policing school halls for guns and narcotics. \\n   At the same that schools are trying to cope with these new and complex stresses and strains, we are demanding that they teach more than that have ever taught before in our history. The reality is that in this high-tech, highly-competitive era, there are fewer low-skilled industrial jobs available, and a premium on knowledge and critical thinking, meaning it is no longer enough to provide some kids with just a rudimentary understanding of the basics. Employers and parents alike with better teachers, stronger standards, and higher test scores for all students, as well as state-of the art technology and the Information Age skills to match. \\n   It is a tribute to the many dedicated men and women who are responsible for teaching our children that the bulk of our schools are as good as they are, in light of these intensifying pressures. But the strain is nevertheless building, and with it serious doubts about our public schools and their capability to meet these challenges. Just this fall the Democratic Leadership Council, of which I am proud to serve as chairman, released a national survey showing that two-thirds of the American people believe our public schools are in crisis. \\n   I was surprised by that high percentage, which may be skewed somewhat by lingering shock over the growing incidents of school shootings. But we must admit that our public schools are not working for a lot of our kids. And, as a result, I believe that our public education system is facing an enormously consequential test, which will go a long way toward determining our future strength as a nation. It is a test of our time whether we can reform and in some ways reinvent our public education system to meet these new demands, without compromising the old ideals that have sustained the common school for generations. \\n   For us to pass this test, we have to first recognize that there are serious problems with the performance of many public schools, and that public confidence in public education will continue to erode if we do not acknowledge and address those problems soon. While student achievement is up, we must realize the alarming achievement gap that separates minorities from Whites and low-income students from their more affluent counterparts. According to the state-by-state reading scores of fourth-graders on the National Assessment of Educational Progress, the achievement gap between African American and White students grew in 16 states between 1992 and 1998. The gap between Hispanic and White students grew in nine states over the same period of time. We must also question whether our schools are adequately preparing our youth to enter the global economy when, in international students, U.S. 12th graders score below the international average in mathematics and science compared to 21 other nations. \\n   We also have to acknowledge that we have not done a very good job in recent years in providing every child with a well-qualified teacher, a critical component to higher student achievement. We are failing to attract enough good minds in the teaching profession--one survey of college students in 21 different fields of study found that education majors ranked 17th in their performance on the SAT. We are failing to adequately train enough of these aspiring teachers at education schools--in Massachusetts last year, to cite one particularly egregious example, 59 percent of the 1,800 candidates who took the state\\'s first-ever certification exam flunked a literacy test that the state board of education chairman rated as at ``about the eighth-grade level.\\'\\' And, we are failing to deliver teachers to the classroom who truly know their subject matter--our national survey found that one-fourth of all secondary school teachers did not major in the core area of instruction, and that in the school districts with the highest concentration of minorities, students have less than a 50 percent chance of getting a math or science teacher who has a license or a degree in their field. \\n   With that said, we also have to acknowledge that while more money alone wont solve our problems, we cannot honesty expect to reinvent our schools without it either. The reality is \\n   that there is a tremendous need for additional investment in our public schools, not just in urban areas but in every kind of community. Thousands of crumbling and overcrowded schools to modernize. Two million new teachers to hire and train. Billions in spiraling special education costs to meet. \\n   We also have to recognize the basic math of trying to raise standards at a time of profound social turbulence that we will need to expend new sums to reach and teach children who in the past we never asked to excel, and who in the present will have to overcome enormous hurdles to do so. I believe any child can learn--any child--and that has been proven over and over again in the best schools in both my home state of Connecticut and in many of America\\'s cities. \\n   There are in fact plenty of positives to highlight in public education today, which is something else that we have to acknowledge, yet too often don\\'t. I have made a concerted effort over the last few years to visit a broad range of schools and programs in Connecticut, and I can tell you that there is much happening in our public schools that we can be heartened by, proud of, and learn from. \\n   There is the John Barry Elementary School in Meriden, Connecticut, which was singled out by the U.S. Department of Education as a Distinguished title I School for its work with disadvantaged students. Like many urban schools, Barry has to contend with a high-poverty, high-mobility student population, but through Reading Recovery and other interventions, Barry has had real success improving the reading skills of many of its students. \\n   There is the Side by Side Charter School in Norwalk, one of 17 charter schools in Connecticut, which has created an exemplary multiracial program in response to the challenge of Sheff v. O\\'Neill to diminish racial isolation. With the freedom that goes with its charter, Side by Side is experimenting with a different approach to classroom assignments, having students stay with teachers for two consecutive years to take advantage of the relationships that develop, and by all indications it is working quite well for those kids. \\n   And there is the BEST program, which, building on previous efforts to raise teacher skills and salaries, is now targeting additional state aid, training, and mentoring support to help local districts nurture new teachers and prepare them to excel. In this regard Connecticut is far ahead of most of the country in adapting its teacher quality programs to meet today\\'s challenges--setting high performance standards both for teachers and those who train them, helping novices meet those standards, and holding the ones who don\\'t accountable. The result is that Connecticut\\'s blueprint is touted by some, including the National Commission on Teaching and America\\'s Future, as a national model for others to follow. \\n   A number of other states, led by Texas and North Carolina, are moving in this same direction--refocusing their education systems not on process but on performance, not on prescriptive rules and regulations but on results. More and more of them are in fact adopting what might be called a ``reinvest, reinvent, and responsibility\\'\\' strategy, by (1) infusing new resources into their public education systems; (2) giving local districts more flexibility; and (3) demanding new measures and mechanisms of accountability, to increase the chances that these investments will yield the intended return, meaning improved academic achievement for all students. \\n   This move to trade flexibility for accountability, and to focus on performance instead of process, is not the definitive answer to passing the test I outlined earlier, of adapting our public schools to the rapidly-changing environment around us. There are obviously other parts of the equation, none more important that parental involvement. Everything we know from research indicates that an engaged parent makes a crucial difference in student achievement, particularly in terms of reading, and we have to do  more to get parents to play a more active role in their children\\'s learning. But when it comes to improving the delivery of public education, the reinvestment and reinvention approach is the best solution I have heard yet, and probably our best hope for extending the promise of equal opportunity into the new century. \\n   In Congress, our opportunity now is with the upcoming reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Today, nearly $15 billion in Federal aid flows through ESEA programs to states and local education authorities, and other educational entities annually. While this constitutes a minute fraction of all the money spent on public education each year, it is still a lot of money, and past experience shows that Federal money has a habit of influencing local behavior. If we can reformulate the way we distribute those additional dollars, and peg our national programs to performance instead of process, we can go a long way toward encouraging more states and local school districts to reinvest and reinvent public education, while taking more responsibility for its outcomes. \\n   Unfortunately, Congress seems more interested in being an agent of recrimination. We spend most of our time positioning ourselves for partisan advantage rather than trying to fix serious problems. We reduce a complicated issue to a simplistic multiple choice test, forcing a false choice between more spending and programs, or block grants and vouchers. And, the answer we are left with is none of the above. \\n   Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues Senators BAYH, BREAUX, GRAHAM, KOHL, LANDRIEU, LINCOLN, and ROBB in introducing this groundbreaking legislation that signifies that there is a better way, a third way to address education reform. It builds on the progress many states have already made through the standards movements. It calls for streamlining and consolidating the maze of programs under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act into five goal-oriented titles, each with more money and fewer strings attached, and all of them geared toward encouraging innovation, promoting what works, and ultimately raising academic achievement for all students. \\n   We would concentrate our efforts on closing the achievement gap between the haves and have-nots, fostering English proficiency for immigrant children, improving the quality of teaching for all children, promoting choice and competition within the public system, and stimulating innovative and high performance educational initiatives. We would ask the states to set performance standards in each of these areas, and in exchange for the new funding and flexibility we provide, we would hold states accountable for delivering demonstrable results. We would reward success and, for the first time in the history of ESEA, punish chronic failure. \\n   We agree with our Democratic colleagues that we need to invest more resources if we want to meet the new challenges of the new century, and prepare every student to succeed in the classroom. That is why we would boost ESEA funding by $35 billion over the next five years. But we also believe that the impact of this funding will be severely diluted if it is not better targeted to the worst-performing schools and if it is not coupled with a demand for results. That is why we not only increase Title I funding by 50 percent, but use a more targeted formula for distributing these new dollars to schools with the highest concentrations of poverty. And that is why we develop a new accountability system that strips federal funding from states that continually fail to meet their performance goals. \\n   We also agree with our Republican colleagues that federal education programs are too numerous and too bureaucratic. That is why we eliminate dozens of federally microtargeted, micromanaged programs that are redundant or incidental to our core mission of raising academic \\n   achievement. But we also believe that we have a great national interest in promoting broad national educational goals, chief among them delivering on the promise of equal opportunity. It is not only foolish, however, but irresponsible to hand out federal dollars with no questions asked and no thought of national priorities. That is why we carve out separate titles in those areas that we think are critical to helping local districts elevate the performance of their schools. \\n   The first would enhance our longstanding commitment to providing extra help to disadvantaged children through the Title I program, while better targeting $12 billion in aid--a 50 percent increase in funding--to schools with the highest concentrations of poor students. The second would combine various teacher training and professional development programs into a single teacher quality grant, increase funding by 100 percent to $1.6 billion annually, and challenge each state to pursue the kind of bold, performance-based reforms that my own state of Connecticut has undertaken with great success. \\n   The third would reform the Federal bilingual education program and hopefully defuse the ongoing controversy surrounding it by making absolutely clear that our national mission is to help immigrant children learn and master English, as well as achieve high levels of achievement in all subjects. We must be willing to back this commitment with essential resources required to help ensure that all limited English proficient students are served. \\n   Under our approach, funding for LEP programs would be more than doubled to $1 billion a year, and for the first time be distributed to states and local districts through a reliable formula, based on their LEP student population. As a result, school districts serving large LEP and high poverty student populations would be guaranteed federal funding, and would not be penalized because of their inability to hire savvy proposal writers for competitive grants. \\n   The fourth would respond to the public demands for greater choice within the public school framework, by providing additional resources for charter school start-ups and new incentives for expanding local, intradistrict choice programs. And the fifth would radically restructure the remaining ESEA and ensure that funds are much better targeted while giving local districts greater flexibility in addressing specific needs. We consolidate more than 20 different programs into a single High Performance Initiatives title, with a focus on supporting bold new ideas, expanding access to summer school and after school programs, improving school safety, and building technological literacy. We increase overall funding by more than $200 million, and distribute this aid through a formula that targets more resources to the highest poverty areas. \\n   The boldest change we are proposing is to create a new accountability title. As of today, we have plenty of rules and requirements on inputs, on how funding is to be allocated and who must be served, but little if any attention to outcomes, on how schools ultimately perform in educating children. This bill would reverse that imbalance by linking Federal funding to the progress states and local districts make in raising academic achievement. It would call on state and local leaders to set specific performance standards and adopt rigorous assessments for measuring how each district is faring in meeting those goals. In turn, states that exceed those goals would be rewarded with additional funds, and those that fail repeatedly to show progress would be penalized. In other words, for the first time, there would be consequences for poor performance. \\n   In discussing how exactly to impose those consequences, we have run into understandable concerns about whether you can penalize failing schools without also penalizing children. The truth is that we are punishing many children right now, especially the most vulnerable of them, by forcing them to attend chronically troubled schools that are accountable to no one, a situation that is just not acceptable anymore. This bill minimizes the potential negative impact of these consequences on students. It provides the states with three years to set their performance-based goals and put in place a monitoring system for gauging how local districts are progressing, and also provides additional resources for states to help school districts identify and improve low-performing schools. If after those three years a state is still failing to meet its goals, the state would be penalized by cutting its administrative funding by 50 percent. Only after four  years of under performance would dollars targeted for the classroom be put in jeopardy. At that point, protecting kids by continuing to subsidize bad schools becomes more like punishing them. \\n   I must address another concern that may be raised that this is a block grant in sheep\\'s clothing. There are substantial differences between a straight block-grant approach and this streamlined structure. First, in most block-grant proposals the accountability mechanisms are vague, weak and often non-existent, which is one reason why I have opposed them in the Senate. Our bill would have tangible consequences, pegged not just to raising test scores in the more affluent suburban areas, but to closing the troubling achievement gap between students in poor, largely minority districts and their better-off peers. \\n   This leads me to another way this bill is different. Unlike many block-grant supporters, I strongly believe that we have a great national interest and a national obligation to promote specific educational goals, chief among them delivering on the promise of equal opportunity, and that is reflected in our legislation. While it makes sense to streamline and eliminate as many strings as possible on Federal aid, to spur innovation and also to maximize the bang for our Federal buck, it does not make sense to hand over those Federal bucks with no questions asked, and thus eliminate the Federal role in setting national priorities. That is why, in the restructuring we have developed, we have maintained separate titles for disadvantaged students, limited English proficient students, teacher quality, public school choice, and high quality education initiatives, all of which, I would argue, are critical to raising academic achievement and promoting equal opportunity. And that is why of the more than $6 billion increase in annual funding I am proposing, $4 billion would be devoted to title I and those students most in need of our help. \\n   It is a fairly common-sense strategy--reinvest in our public schools, reinvent the way we administer them, and restore a sense of responsibility to the children we are supposed to be serving. Hence the title of our bill: the Public Education Reinvention, Reinvestment, and Responsibility Act, or the Three R\\'s for short. Our approach is humble enough to recognize there are no easy answers to turning around low-performing schools, to lifting teaching standards, to closing the debilitating achievement gap, and that most of those answers won\\'t be found here in Washington anyway. But it is ambitious enough to try to harness our unique ability to set the national agenda and recast the federal government as an active catalyst for success instead of a passive enabler of failure. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-20000308\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask what the pending business is. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-20000308\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to speak with my colleagues about the justifiably increasing concern among the American people about the increasing price of gasoline and other fuels. \\n   The fact is that our gas pumps are fast turning into sump pumps for American pocketbooks. Just 2 days ago, the Energy Information Administration pegged the average current retail price for a gallon of gas at $1.54. That is the highest level in a decade for this time of the year. \\n   Unfortunately, this is not the end of it. Prices are expected to soar beyond this height in the months ahead. In fact, the Energy Information Administration is projecting an average price of more than $1.80 a gallon of gas by Memorial Day, the start of the summer driving season. \\n   That is, in and of itself, according to experts on oil pricing to whom I have spoken, an optimistic assessment. It is predicated on the promises of several OPEC nations that they will raise their production of oil after their March 27  meeting and thus lower the price of crude oil. \\n   There are very reputable analysts of oil markets who are saying the average per gallon price of gasoline will go to $2 and in some places as high as $2.50 a gallon this summer. Ouch. That is not only unprecedented but will have a disastrous effect not only on individual businesses and consumers, particularly those of more modest average means, but it will, I am afraid, have a disastrous effect on our economy, setting off a vicious cycle of prolonged oil price increases, an increase in inflation rates, corresponding hikes in interest rates, and a stall in the historic run of economic growth we have had over the last several years. \\n   Another consequence of oil price increases, as we unsettlingly saw yesterday, could be significant declines in the stock markets. I understand the decline yesterday was attributed not just to oil price increases but also to the report from Procter & Gamble that they would be reporting lower quarterly profits than were expected. But oil price increases are part of it. \\n   Not surprisingly, yesterday crude oil trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose $1.95 to $34.13 a barrel, which is the highest level increase since November 1990--the highest level increase in a decade. \\n   I trust that my colleagues are hearing from their constituents, both individual and business, as I am, with complaints ever more vociferous about the strain this price spike in gasoline is putting on their family and business budgets. As these energy and transportation costs continue to climb, the cries for help will also increase. \\n   The squeeze is now being felt across the country, but it constitutes for us in the Northeast the second chapter of this current sad story of energy pricing since, as I know you know, Mr. President, the State of Connecticut and the entire Northeast was particularly hard hit by a prolonged price shock in home heating oil, which more than doubled in a space of months the amount people in our region of the country were paying. So this jump now in the price of gasoline represents what might be called a ``double energy pricing whack.\\'\\' \\n   Last week, on Thursday, several Members of Congress in both parties were invited to the White House for a meeting of the President, Secretary Richardson, Secretary Summers, and others in the administration to discuss these matters. It was a spirited discussion and one that represented a very good exchange. \\n   I say to my neighbors and constituents in the Northeast that the most encouraging part of the discussion to me was the receptivity of the administration to an idea that my colleague from Connecticut, Senator DODD, and I put forward to create a regional home heating oil reserve--not crude oil as in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve we have now but home heating oil which could be used in cases as the one we just experienced in the Northeast when there was what I consider to be an artificial rise in price based on the OPEC cartel limiting supply in what is, after all, a critically necessary commodity--fuel. \\n   It would allow this reserve to immediately put out at times such as this in the future an amount of home heating oil, \\n   distillate product--it could go for diesel fuel as well, where price increases have so hurt truckers--to raise supplies so that the price could decline to a more balanced point. \\n   Work goes on and discussion goes on. This idea could be a model in energy shortages in other regions. Some regions dependent on propane, for instance, might create similar reserves that could be used to effect when artificial prices create dramatically increasing prices. \\n   I look forward to continuing those discussions with the administration. At a minimum, if we can do something between now and next winter, it will give people and businesses in the Northeast some comfort--I apologize for the metaphor--but a kind of security blanket, if you will, so that next year, if OPEC again reduces supply, they will have the home heating oil at reasonable prices to heat their homes and businesses. \\n   Let me turn now to the gasoline price increase which is now going across the country and has very significant ramifications for our economy overall. \\n   My apologies to Ernest Hemingway. I ask, For whom does the gas pump toll today? I say the answer is, It tolls for us--not just that we are paying it, but it should remind us once again of the debilitating dangers of our dependence on foreign oil, reminding us that our consumers and our economic security are being held hostage by the decisions of the OPEC producers as they are in this case following their own interests, but it is not in our interest. \\n   No matter how great a country we are--the strongest country in the world, the most successful economy with the greatest standard of living--we have put ourselves in a position where a small group of nations, because they control this commodity--oil--that is so vital to us, can hold us hostage. \\n   So the President has to send the Secretary of Energy and others, basically, pleading with these oil-producing countries that are supposed to be our friends and allies to get reasonable and to increase the supply so that they fill at least the two-million-barrel-per-day gap between supply and demand on world oil prices. \\n   I hope as we face this crisis, though, we will take steps to declare--as we have been saying now for two decades, but to do it hopefully with some meaning, greater meaning--energy independence, and to do so by tapping in more vigorously to the supplies of energy over which we have some control, such as natural gas and oil, where that is possible within our own domestic control. \\n   Mr. President, I think we have to more aggressively try to convert and develop supplies of energy in our control. We have to more aggressively support conservative efforts and development of renewable, cleaner sources of energy. \\n   We have to be prepared to invest and continue to support even more aggressively some of the pioneering, pathbreaking work being done in the automobile industry to develop high-fuel-efficiency vehicles. \\n   Very exciting work is being done, and we can help with further support in the development of fuel cells as a renewable clean source of energy. The truth is, no matter how strong, innovative, entrepreneurial, and how great our increases in productivity are in this country, until we invest more into the energy that drives our economy, we are going to be subject to being effectively brought to our knees and having our markets and our bank accounts follow down in that direction. \\n   Another item discussed at the meeting with President Clinton and Secretary Richardson last week, advanced by my colleague and friend from New York, Senator SCHUMER, Senator COLLINS of Maine, and others, was, in this crisis, to be prepared to either swap or draw down the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, in which there is now approximately 580 million barrels of oil owned by the taxpayers of the United States, and put some of that at this critical moment into our economy as a way to fill the gap between supply and demand, and, frankly, as a way to let our friends at OPEC know that, though our resources are limited, they are not meager and that we are prepared to contend with their artificial inflation of oil prices. \\n   I report these developments to my colleagues and say I believe that the President, at least, is keeping the option of using oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve on the table. No commitments were made, no decision was made either about that or a final decision made about the strategic heating oil reserve for our region that I discussed earlier. I appreciated the discussion and I appreciated the active and, obviously, concerned interest that was expressed by the President at the meeting last week. \\n   I look forward to continuing those discussions. I hope we can do it in a spirit of reason and balance and not in a spirit of panic because our economy has been stalled and our markets have been essentially attacked and have fallen as a result of this shortage in oil supply, based on the actions of an oil cartel, OPEC, which hurts the United States because of our continuing dependence on foreign oil. \\n   I yield the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-20000308\\n\\n    Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr President, I rise today to pay tribute to a woman who has sent her reasoned voice across the radio airwaves of America. A strong willed and strong minded woman who is not only a friend, but I\\'m fortunate to say is also a constituent, Judy Jarvis. Yesterday, this great radio talk show host, Judy Jarvis, my friend, lost her battle with cancer. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-20000306\\n\\n    Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered by Senator BOXER to S. 1134 that would help to protect children from exposure to pesticides used in schools. In the wake of tragic incidents in schools across the nation, many people now think of school safety in terms of enhanced protection from violent crime. My colleague\\'s amendment addresses a less visible aspect of school safety: the need to reduce environmental health hazards from pesticides. \\n   Because of their smaller size, greater intake of food and air relative to body weight, recreational environment, and developing systems, children are at higher risk from pesticide exposure than adults. Numerous studies show  that pesticides can pose health risks to children, such as impaired cognitive skills, fatigue, burns, elevated rates of childhood leukemia, soft tissue sarcoma, and brain cancer. Pesticides can be absorbed from exposure through skin contact, inhalation, or ingestion. One recent study showed that after a single broadcast use of chlorpyrifos, a pesticide commonly used in schools, the chemical remained on children\\'s toys and hard surfaces for two weeks, resulting in exposure 21-119 times above the current recommended safe dose. \\n   Last year, I requested that the General Accounting Office review the federal requirements that govern the use of pesticides in schools and the existence of data on the use and incidences of illnesses related to exposure. In January when I released the GAO report, ``Use, Effects, and Alternatives to Pesticides in Schools,\\'\\' I noted that its results underscore the lack of both comprehensive information about the amount of pesticides used in our nation\\'s schools, and data on whether pesticide exposure is adversely affecting our children\\'s health. \\n   In January, I called on Administrator Browner to task her agency to take immediate steps to protect children from exposure to pesticides in schools, including providing guidance to applicators and school districts on the relative exposures of different application methods, taking action to appropriately label pesticides that are being used in school environments, and consider conducting a full-scale statistical survey on the use of pesticides in schools to determine whether risks are posed to children by pesticides through cumulative exposure. \\n   Ultimately, these measures all would lead to better information about the risks of pesticide exposure to children. However, we also need to act now to help parents protect their children in the interim. In 1999, Connecticut passed a bill requiring schools to create registries of parents who wish to be informed prior to school use of pesticides. Several other states have taken similar action. However, parents in many states still do not have access to information about when and what pesticides are being used in their children\\'s schools. Senator BOXER\\'s amendment would remedy this problem by ensuring that all parents receive advance notification before toxic pesticides are applied on school or day care center grounds. \\n   In addition to supporting Senator BOXER\\'s notification amendment, I am a cosponsor of Senator TORRICELLI\\'s School Environment Protection Act of 1999, or SEPA, which is currently before the Agriculture Committee. In addition to recognizing the need for parental notification before pesticides are used in schools, SEPA would create a national requirement that when pesticides are used in schools, only the safest methods are followed in order to protect children. I recently visited a school system in Cheshire, Connecticut, that has very successfully implemented these methods, known as Integrated Pest Management, or IPM. The Cheshire school system works closely with local contractors, who carry out monthly visual inspections of the schools, use least toxic pesticides when required, and apply them after hours and after contacting the school nurse. SEPA would require that, like the Cheshire schools, schools nationwide ensure that pesticides are applied safely and only when alternatives have failed. \\n   I am pleased to be able to support Senator BOXER today in her effort to help parents protect their children by reducing their exposure to potentially harmful pesticides. And I hope that there will be further opportunities to discuss the important issue of decreasing children\\'s exposure to pesticides in schools.  \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-20000302\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. \\n   I rise to speak both in favor of the underlying proposal offered by the Senator from Georgia and the Senator from New Jersey, which I am pleased to be a cosponsor of, but also to speak on behalf of an amendment that has been introduced by the Senator from Louisiana, Ms. LANDRIEU, on behalf of herself, Senator BAYH, and myself. \\n   Let me say briefly, on the underlying proposal, it is a modest but important proposal which encourages parents and enables parents through the tax benefits provided to set aside some money for their children\\'s future, \\n   and to use it for a variety of educational purposes that have been well outlined here. This proposal, as has been said over and over again, is no different than existing legislation for use at the college level. I support it enthusiastically and think it is a step forward. It will be of particular help to struggling middle-class families who want the best for their children\\'s education and often find it hard to pay the way. This will help them just a little bit. \\n   Second, speaking about the amendment offered by Senator LANDRIEU and Senator BAYH and myself, as I have followed the debate on the Coverdell-Torricelli proposal, I have been troubled, again, to see the Senate divided largely along partisan lines. The lines are familiar, the arguments have been heard before, but they do not get us anywhere, and they particularly do not respond to the message that I get clearly when I go home and speak to people in Connecticut and that I guess my colleagues here get when they go to their respective States. It is that there is nothing that matters more to the people of America today than to improve our system of education, particularly public education, but all education, private, faith-based as well. \\n   If we respond to that clear plea, that priority of our constituents, with partisanship and posturing that produces nothing but a continuation of the status quo, then shame on us. So in hopes of reaching a realistic consensus in the weeks ahead, this debate in some ways has been a warm-up. But it is an important one that has substance attached to it for the broader debate on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. \\n   The amendment Senator LANDRIEU has put forward is a piece of a broader proposal that she and I and Senator BAYH, Senator LINCOLN, and others are developing as a total reform of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. It is building on good news in a number of our States which are moving in the direction, not of a fixation with rules and regulations or bureaucracies but concentrating instead on results: How can we improve the educational performance of our children? \\n   In the States that are succeeding, they are doing three things. First, they are infusing new resources into their public education systems. We are going to have to invest more. Second, they are giving local districts more flexibility in how they meet those higher standards as they determine the needs of their children and local school systems. Third, they are demanding new measures and mechanisms of accountability to increase the chance that these investments will yield the intended return, which is higher academic achievement by all of our students. Those are the goals of the bill that Senators LANDRIEU, BAYH, LINCOLN, I and several others are drafting. \\n   It calls for revamping the framework of our Federal education programs and engaging the States in a new performance-based partnership, where we would significantly increase Federal funding to help our schools meet these new expectations, to target these new dollars to the communities and children who are disadvantaged, who need them most, and to provide State and local officials with broad latitude in allocating these resources to meet their specific priorities. We then hold the States responsible for showing progress in meeting those goals, to reward those who do and, yes, to punish those who do not better educate our children. \\n   In this approach, we believe and hope, are the seeds of a bipartisan solution. It brings together what is best \\n   on both sides of the favored educational reform. For those who call for more resources and more targeting to poor urban and rural districts, we are proposing increasing our investment in ESEA by $25 billion over the next 5 years, 80 percent of which would be put into title I. \\n   For those who call for more flexibility of local control, we propose consolidating the mass of Federal categorical grant programs, a kind of Washington-knows-best attitude, into five performance-based partnership grants, all of which are tied to the overarching goal of raising our children\\'s academic achievement. And for everyone, the parent in particular, who is concerned about the bottom line--and the bottom line here is how well are my children being educated--we propose making accountability our new education linchpin by rewarding States that exceed their own performance goals and punishing those who routinely fail to show such progress. \\n   We plan to introduce this bill next week and hope to have it considered on the floor during the ESEA debate. In the meantime, I appeal to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to take a hard look at that proposal and the ideas behind it. \\n   I recognize nothing we do at the Federal level can, by itself, solve the problems of education in our country. But we can create incentives for change and innovation. We can identify the way and build the will to get there, which is our goal, as is, may I say, the goal of the underlying bill before the Senate today. \\n   I support the Landrieu amendment. I am proud also to state my support for the Coverdell-Torricelli bill. \\n   I yield the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-20000222\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to support this legislation. I particularly wish to thank the majority leader for his steadfast and very strong support for this important piece of legislation. The majority leader has recognized the serious threat that the proliferation of ballistic missile capacity and weapons of mass destruction to rogue nations, such as Iran, represents to our forces in the Middle East, to our allies in the Middle East, and in the not-too-distant future--maybe real soon--to our allies in Europe, and, heaven protect us, to the United States of America, to our homeland. \\n   We have talked a lot in this Chamber, and outside, about national missile defense. We crossed a bridge on this issue last year, I think, with the bipartisan legislation sponsored initially by the majority leader\\'s colleague from Mississippi, Senator COCHRAN. \\n   But if we are now involved in an effort to develop a national missile defense, does it not make sense to use whatever authority we have to deter, to retard, and, if possible, to prevent a rogue nation, such as Iran, from developing the capacity to strike us and our allies? \\n   This is to me the other side of the American effort to protect us and our people and our allies from what, in the years ahead, I am afraid will be the single most serious threat to our security, which is, the proliferation of ballistic missile capacity and weapons of mass destruction. \\n   The majority leader has been the leader on the bill we are considering today, and I have been privileged to work with him on it. I appreciate the broad bipartisan support we have on this measure. As the majority leader said, this legislation could have been stronger. It started out stronger when we introduced the initial legislation, but in the process of trying to get something done, we modified it. \\n   It still makes an important statement to the world about the steadfast commitment of the Congress of the United States to do everything we can to diminish the threat of weapons of mass destruction carried by ballistic missiles. It sends a message to our friends in Russia about the intensity of our concern about their part in helping Iran develop weapons of mass destruction. I believe it sends a message to the Administration of the United States about the broad bipartisan support in Congress for tougher actions against any nation, including Russia--with whom we have a developing relationship--if they are supporting Iran in the development of this destructive capacity. \\n   A reporter stopped me earlier today on the way to the Chamber and asked: Aren\\'t you worried about the effect that passage of the Iran Nonproliferation Act will have on the Government of Russia or in the Presidential elections coming in Russia? My answer, directly, is no. But, obviously, we are all concerned and hopeful that the forces of reform will take hold in Russia and bring stability and progress to that country. But our first concern has to be not what happens in Russia, but what we can do to protect the security of the American people in this country and our forces abroad from the threat of weapons of mass destruction carried by ballistic missiles. If the Russian Government will be true to its own statements about working against proliferation, then there will be no problem for Russia as a result of the passage of this legislation. \\n   My colleagues have talked about changes in Iran. The developments are most remarkable in Iran. There is a whole new generation of Iranians and, if I am not mistaken, more than half of it was not of age when the extreme Islamic revolution, led by Ayatollah Khomeini, occurred in the late 1970s. It is a generation that appears to want reform, better lives for themselves, freedom, better relations with the West, and better relations with the \\n   United States of America. \\n   Remarkably, in the midst of the very authoritarian government that came into power in the late 1970s and has been there since, the Iranians have continued to have elections. \\n   Here is the power of the people at work again. Last Friday, apparently, more than four out of five eligible voters came out to vote in Iran. I say, parenthetically, what an embarrassment it should be to us to recall that in 1998, the last time we had a congressional election--our own, if you will, parliamentary election--36 percent of the  eligible voters came out to vote; only one-third, as compared to more than four-fifths in Iran. They are apparently expressing very broad support for the forces of reform. \\n   Does that diminish the concern we have about what Iran is doing? Not immediately, unfortunately. Because the power is still exercised by a small group of leaders at the top. Not by the reform-oriented, moderate President Khatami, but by the religious leaders at the top who still exercise and control the agencies of foreign policy, defense policy, and intelligence policy, who still have the power to override and veto any of the acts, even of this new reform Parliament. \\n   The focus of our concern about Iran is that it has been our most implacable foe in the recent past and that it has been the single most intransigent supporter of terrorism against this Nation and our allies, a reality that remains unchanged. \\n   The thought that weapons of mass destruction, carried by ballistic missiles, would be in the possession of this nation, effectively still controlled by this small group of enemies of the United States, should fill us with the most profound fear and anxiety. \\n   It is from that fear and anxiety that this bill emerges. It is not the first time we have expressed our concerns about these developments in Iran. In previous enactments we have given the Administration the tools to try to address this problem, specifically in the Arms Export Control Act and in the Iran-Iraq Sanctions Act. But we were not satisfied with those measures and the way they were being used, so we passed the Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act in 1997, \\n   a measure similar to this legislation we are considering today. \\n   Unfortunately, the President chose to veto that legislation. That is why H.R. 1883 was introduced and why it passed the House overwhelmingly, 419-0, with every Member of both parties who voted supporting it. \\n   Since 1997, our concern about the problem has not diminished. It is widely and reliably reported--this is why we are back with this legislation--that entities and people in Russia continue to provide both technology and assistance to Iran to build these dangerous weapons. Iran has made worrying progress on its missile program, as the majority leader indicated and as the intelligence reports, classified as they are, which are available to our colleagues, clearly state. \\n   I cite also an unclassified source. According to the Congressional Research Service, with help from Russians and others, notably North Koreans and Chinese, Iran has produced a Shahab 3 ballistic missile with a range of 800 miles and tested it; on July 22, 1998, to be exact. Although the first test was apparently unsuccessful, the Congressional Research Service reports that the Shahab 3 is now thought to be operational and in production. There also have been credible reports that Iran is in the process of developing yet another, more advanced missile, the Shahab 4, which would have a range of up to 2,000 miles, more than double the range of the Shahab 3. We have some basis for believing the Iranians are now working on intercontinental ballistic missiles. \\n   If combined with weapons of mass destruction, these existing Iranian missiles can threaten American forces and our allies and friends in the Middle East and, soon after that, as indicated, our forces and allies throughout Europe and, of course, eventually, the American homeland itself. This is a frightening prospect, given Iran\\'s large chemical weapons program and aggressive attempt to acquire a nuclear weapons capability. The American Government has made it clear that Iran is attempting--in this case largely with China\\'s help--to reach self-sufficiency in the manufacture and stockpiling of chemical weapons, though Iran continues to deny that charge. Concerns have also been expressed by authorities in our country that Iran is seeking to become a nuclear arms state by attempting to buy material for such weapons or by using nonmilitary nuclear assistance to build up its knowledge about nuclear weapons. \\n   These programs in Iran can profoundly change the balance of power in the region and strike a very serious blow to our efforts to contain Iran until it becomes a responsible member of the community of nations, until the forces of change which are blowing so hopefully through Iran, even as we speak today, reach fruition and a change of policy. \\n   I am sure most everyone in this Chamber will look forward to a day when sanctions of this kind will not be necessary because a new government, representing what seems to be the clear will of the Iranian people, would be in power in Tehran; a government with which the United States of America and our allies could have constructive and peaceful relations. But until that time, the kinds of weapons capabilities that are being developed allow Iran to threaten, for instance, friendly Arab States, making it harder for them to cooperate with the United States. These weapons capabilities would raise the risks to U.S. military forces in the region and could threaten the free flow of oil out of this critical region which could, of course, create crises in the United States, in Europe, Asia, and in any other place in the world that depends on fuel from the Middle East to power their economies. \\n   It is self-evident and axiomatic that we have to do whatever we can to try to deter this dangerous capability, to delay it, to retard it as best we can, given the Iranian Government that now exists. Part of that is making clear, as I believe this legislation does, to our friends in Russia in no uncertain terms that we are serious about this. The time for hit and miss, slower, bob-and-weave progress toward shutting off Russian assistance to \\n   Iran for the development of these dangerous programs is over. \\n   In addition to other sanctions, we have focused in this bill on holding up extraordinary, as we call it, American funding for the international space station to the Russian space agency, unless Russia takes sufficient action to halt any part it is playing in proliferation to Iran. This is our attempt to demonstrate the seriousness of our concern about this matter, even to the extent of stopping the funding of a program that is not only important to us--that is, space cooperation--but important to the Russians. \\n   While we cannot expect to prevent all technology transfers to rogue states, we do have the ability to check the flow of some of it by adopting the kinds of sanctions in this legislation that are aimed at persons engaged in such activity. We are able and therefore must act to take measures against those governments that condone such activity, whether or not they are organizing and abetting the transfer, or merely looking the other way when their citizens engage in these activities. \\n   Senator LOTT quoted CIA Director George Tenet. Director Tenet has made quite clear that despite the noticeable shifts within Iran, it remains ``the most active state sponsor of terrorism.\\'\\' Iran\\'s support for dangerous terrorist groups such as Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, through training, money, and weapons, has just not ended. There are people in our country, people whom I respect, who continue to sustain the belief, based on evidence they have gathered, that Iran was involved in the 1996 attack on American service personnel at Khobar in Saudi Arabia, though no definitive conclusion has been reached on that matter. \\n   We have been engaged in a dialog across a wide spectrum with our friends and allies in trying to address the issue of proliferation to Iran. The prospect of a nuclear-capable, militarily powerful Iran armed with ballistic missiles is clearly a threat to our national interests and to those of our allies; therefore, we must act to stop it. The sanctions we are proposing will further stop the diffusion of this technology and lead to a more stable Middle East. \\n   I echo the words of the majority leader: The passage of this measure may actually encourage the forces of reform in Iran which are now so boldly and inspiringly expressing themselves. It certainly does seem that those forces of reform want to have better relations with the West, with the United States. Part of what we are saying to them is, this matters to us. You must stop your support of terrorism. Stop your development of these weapons of mass destruction, and we can develop a much better relationship.  \\n   The bill itself is simple and direct. It requires the President to submit reports to Congress on foreign entities where there is credible information that these entities have transferred certain goods, services, or technologies to Iran. That part of the bill would apply to any entities anywhere in the world, not just the Russians. It authorizes the President to impose measures against these entities, but does not mandate him to do so. It allows him to consider exculpatory material, material that argues against the guilt of the entities. \\n   And with an amendment that will be adopted, submitted by the Senator from Michigan, Mr. LEVIN, those entities will be given an opportunity to respond to those allegations before any sanctions are considered. \\n   Finally, the bill prohibits these extraordinary American payments to the Russian space agency until certain conditions enumerated in the bill are met. The purpose is to say to the Russians specifically that we keep seeing compelling evidence that entities in Russia are supporting the development of these dangerous programs within Iran. \\n   As much as we want to continue to work with Russia on joint efforts in space, we will not do so if they are contributing to this grave threat to our security. \\n   Finally, I thank Senator LOTT, Senator BIDEN, Senator HELMS, and others on both sides who have worked together to bring this bill to the floor, where I have reason to believe it will achieve strong support. I was pleased to hear representatives of the Administration indicate to some of us a short while ago that, though they may not specifically support the bill, they would not recommend that, in its current form, the President veto it. I think we are on the way to making a unified statement, which is a constructive one, and which takes a small but significant step toward protecting us, our children, and grandchildren from the threat of weapons of mass destruction carried by ballistic missiles. \\n   I thank the Chair and yield the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-2-20000222\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from Delaware for his kind words and the spirit of cooperation in \\n   which we have worked on this and on so many other matters over the years. I could not agree with him more on what he said. There is an irony here. It is as if folks in places such as Russia are still doing what we sometimes criticize people in our country for doing--going by a cold-war mentality. But it is a cold-war mentality heavily not only affected by communism, but what the Senator has said, capitalism. So they are selling for short-term gains that, before very long, will endanger them more than us. This is our attempt to say: We are in this together. We are threatened by what you are doing, but watch out, friends, you are going to be threatened soon yourselves. \\n   I thank the Senator for his characteristically straight talk--although he is not on the Straight Talk Express. He is a straight talker in the Senate Chamber. I thank him for his support. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-3-20000222\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. I agree. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-4-20000222\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. I agree. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-5-20000222\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. I agree. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-20000210\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about an extremely serious problem plaguing the citizens of my state of Connecticut and those throughout the Northeast--the skyrocketing cost of home heating oil and the fear of higher gas prices that will follow. \\n   This complaint may sound familiar to some of my colleagues, particularly those similarly-situated in cold-weather states. Senator DODD and I and several others have repeatedly voiced concerns about the volatility of the heating oil-gasoline marketplace over the last several years, about the sudden swings in prices we have experienced as a result of that volatility, and the threat it poses to the livelihood of our constituents and the stability of our regional economy. The situation now, though, is more dire than anything we have seen in recent years. While I do not want to be an alarmist, I think it is critical for my colleagues to understand the severity of the squeeze many families and businesses are feeling and the potential for economic havoc. \\n   We are bordering on a real crisis. The average price of a gallon of heating oil in the Northeast has jumped more than 100 percent since mid-January. Many families are really struggling to pay their bills and keep their families warm. Dealers and distributors are reporting significant shortages throughout the region, which promises to send prices spiraling even higher in the near term. And if this vicious cycle of high demand and low supply continues to turn, and if the weather stays the way it has, many households may literally be left out in the cold, and their well-being put at risk. \\n   It is not just consumers, though, who are being hit hard by this price spike. It is also hurting a number of small businesses that are not prepared to absorb this kind of sudden surge in costs. It sure is hurting many small companies in the heating oil industry, the independent distributors and retailers, who form the backbone of this market. I have already heard of one oil dealer in Connecticut who owns a family business and who needed to take out a second mortgage on his home to make it through this hardship. It may not be long before others join him. There is also the very real risk of some small dealers being forced out of business. \\n   As a result of all this, a conspicuous current of fear and uncertainty is rippling throughout the Northeast. People are anxious for some answers just as they are desperate for some relief. Like many of my colleagues, my offices have been inundated with calls from around the state from outraged homeowners demanding to know why their heating bills are going through the roof and what we are doing to bring them down. \\n   We know that supplies are low and demand is high, and that is the basic source of the problem. But it goes much deeper than that. The decision made by OPEC to limit the production and supply of crude oil on the international market has been a major factor. Our domestic supply has shrunk considerably. Another factor has been the temperature; the cold weather and strong winds have not only kept demand high, they have frozen rivers and made it difficult at times for oil barges to dock and unload their product. And some questions have to be raised about the choices made by the major oil companies, while the supply of crude oil may have been sufficient to meet \\n   demand, the refiners may have made matters worse by focusing on turning out more gasoline than heating oil in anticipation of a warmer winter. These questions deserve more attention, and I intend to press for more information about how these decisions are being made about utilization of capacity, which are critical to determining oil supplies and by extension oil prices. \\n   But the complexity of this problem does not mean we are powerless to help. Along with Senator DODD and the rest of our state delegation, we have been doing all we can to provide some immediate relief from these spiraling prices and troubling shortages. One of our principal concerns is for the low-income families who are being asked to choose between putting food on the table and heating their homes. The price spike is hitting these families the hardest, and we are doing our best to help them make it through. A bipartisan coalition sent a letter to the President two weeks ago urging him to quickly release emergency funds from the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which is a critical first line of defense for our neighbors who are least able to cope with sudden price surges. The President thankfully responded by releasing $45 million for the disadvantaged families of New England, including $3.1 million for those in Connecticut. This was a significant gesture, but there are many families who won\\'t benefit from it. That is why just two days ago our coalition sent the President another letter requesting that an additional $200 million in LIHEAP funding be released immediately. I hope the President again hears our concerns and heeds our call. \\n   I am also concerned about the independent oil suppliers in the Northeast. Most home heating oil distributors are small businesses with few employees; these businesses are not always in the position to weather severe price fluctuations or shortages as we are seeing now. Part of the problem is that small oil dealers often must pay the high price of crude oil from large wholesalers before they are able to collect on oil sales to residential homes. This leaves them with few reserves to make due. To help relieve the burden on these businesses, I have asked the Small Business Administration to make available a package of short turnaround loans and technical assistance. The SBA has been highly sensitive to this problem, and they are moving quickly to spread the word around the region about these options.  \\n   Along with several of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I have supported and continue to support a drawdown of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve as a way to quickly boost stocks in the Northeast and thereby quickly reduce prices. Senator DODD and I and several of our colleagues from neighboring states have lobbied hard for the Administration to take that step. We have cosponsored legislation that explicitly authorizes the Secretary of Energy to tap the SPR in these circumstances. We wrote the President two weeks ago urging him to approve a drawdown as soon as possible. And shortly thereafter we met with Energy Secretary Bill Richardson to plead this case directly. The Secretary unfortunately has been reluctant to pursue this option, but we have not given up hope of changing his mind, and will continue to push our argument. \\n   While we believe the SPR drawdown is critical to getting us through this short-term emergency, it is not a long-term solution. It will not and cannot defuse the volatility of the heating oil marketplace. But there are a number of steps we can take to prevent these disruptive price spikes from cycling in and out. First, it is important that we convince leaders of the oil-producing nations that colluding to hold down supply is not in their long-term interest. As we have seen, prices of oil have indeed gone up, but there is growing resentment of the policies of OPEC as our citizens feel a strengthening pinch. It is important that these countries understand that if they continue with this strategy, they may jeopardize good relations with the United States. Secretary Richardson will soon be meeting \\n   with OPEC\\'s leaders, and we are pressing him to forcefully communicate this message to our allies and trading partners. \\n   Second, we should take a hard look at the use of interruptible gas contracts by natural gas suppliers and the evidence that these contracts may be exacerbating the volatility of the heating oil market. These ``interruptible\" contracts can be obtained at a discount rate in exchange for giving the contractor the ability to suspend service when gas supply is low or demand is high. When these contracts are interrupted, many customers typically turn to heating oil as their preferred alternative, creating a sudden, secondary demand jolt to the oil market. I have heard from a number of leaders in the heating oil industry who fear that this is exactly what is happening now. We need to better understand the level of additional heating oil demand caused by these types of contracts and be able to anticipate demand fluctuations as accurately as possible so that we may avoid future situations where demand exceeds supply. For that reason, I recently asked Secretary Richardson to investigate the extent and impact of interruptible contracts, and to report back to us on his findings to determine what if anything we should do about this practice. \\n   Our current situation points to the fundamental problem that we are far too dependent upon foreign oil for our energy needs. We need to employ long-term strategies to decrease our reliance upon foreign nations and bolster our own energy capacity. Many of us have cosponsored legislation in the past to increase research and development funding for renewable energy sources. We need to invest time, money, and an increased level of effort in the development of energy efficient power sources such as wind, solar, and natural gas. I will continue to work toward this goal and I strongly urge my colleagues to do so as well. \\n   Mr. President, as I said, I rise to speak about a very serious problem plaguing the citizens of Connecticut and the Northeast; that is, the skyrocketing cost of home heating oil and the fear of higher gas prices that will come with the warmer weather. There is a very complicated situation as to why it exists. \\n   It begins with the decision by the OPEC cartel to reduce the supply of oil. It goes to the decision of some oil companies not to refine adequate supplies of home heating oil. Whatever the complexity, it does not mean that we are powerless to help. \\n   Senator DODD and I, and the rest of our delegation, on earlier occasions, with colleagues from throughout the Northeast from both parties, have appealed to the President to release Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program funding. He did that--$45 million worth. \\n   We have another request in now for an additional $200 million. It is that bad in our State. \\n   The real answer to this is to open up the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and effect the laws of supply and demand, 560 million barrels of oil that we, the taxpayers, U.S. Government own. This is the time to use it. \\n   Up until now, Secretary Richardson and the administration have refused to do so. I appeal to them today on behalf of the people of Connecticut who are suffering under the shock of doubling and in some cases tripling of what they pay for home heating oil. Please open up the reserve. There is now a new idea of swaps, not selling the oil but allowing the oil companies to take it out of reserve, bring it into the market, increase supply, lower price, and then put oil back into the reserve, even a higher amount. \\n   The short of it is, we are in crisis in the Northeast. It is a crisis that, if it is not stopped and is allowed to go on, with higher gasoline prices that will affect the rest of the country in spring time, it will begin to create the kind of inflation that will cut the economic growth we have enjoyed.  \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-20000202\\n\\n    Mr. LIEBERMAN. \\n   Mr. President, I rise today to proudly introduce with my esteemed colleagues, Senators SANTORUM, ABRAHAM, FEINSTEIN, LANDRIEU, BAYH, and ROBB, the Savings for Working Families Act of 2000. This legislation directly addresses a problem that is now starting to receive the attention that it deserves: the growing wealth gap in our country. This legislation builds on a bipartisan effort begun last session to help more low-income working families join our country\\'s economic mainstream by addressing that wealth gap. Passing this legislation will help expand our economic winner\\'s circle to include more working families. Because what goes up for the richest families, particularly in these boom times, need not come down for other families. \\n   Today with my colleagues, I put forward a modest yet promising proposal that we believe will help more low income families share in our country\\'s economic prosperity. Today we will introduce new legislation to support the expansion of Individual Development Accounts, or IDAs, an innovative and powerful tool to help the working poor save and develop the assets they need to get ahead and thrive in the new economy--to enter the winner\\'s circle. \\n   The Savings for Working Families Act of 2000 will benefit working, low-income families across this country to share in the unprecedented prosperity of our booming economy. Our bill brings together Republicans and Democrats, policy wonks and working mothers, and even financial institutions and consumers, all in support of a new approach to sustaining some American ideals--hard work, thrift, individual responsibility, and entrepreneurship. The Savings for Working Families Act of 2000 provides the real incentives and real opportunities for the working poor to build assets, both human and financial capital, which they in turn will be able to invest in our national economy. \\n   Today\\'s economy is defying gravity. The stock market is jumping to record highs while inflation and unemployment are hovering at record lows. Millions of Americans are reaping the benefits of the longest economic expansion in our history, including millions of working middle class families. Unfortunately, millions more are not. \\n   Several recent studies have documented a growing income gap in the U.S.--an increasing income disparity between the rich and poor with declining incomes for both poor and low-income families. In addition to that income gap, a report released recently by the Federal Reserve Bank, has identified a significant asset gap in this country. A gap where the net worth--or assets--of the typical American family has risen substantially since 1989, while the net worth--or assets--of lower income families has actually declined during the economic boom of recent years. \\n   According to the Fed report, families earning under $10,000 a year had a median net worth of $1,900 in 1989. That climbed to $4,800 in 1995, but had slipped back to $3,600 by 1998. Those families earning $10,000 to $25,000 saw their net worth drop from $31,000 in 1995 to $24,800 in 1998. More specifically, while the percent of all U.S. families that own a home or business has risen during the boom years of 1995-98, the percent among lower income families has decreased. For example, in 1995, 36.1% of families earning under $10,000 annually owned their home. By 1998 the rate had dropped to 34.5%. The drop for families earning $10,000 to $25,000 was from 54.9% to 51.7%. The same story is true for the percent of lower income families owning a business. \\n   The Savings for Working Families Act of 2000 will directly address exactly this asset gap. Our bill seeks to address this imbalance by dramatically expanding the use of IDAs. IDA programs  do work and are reporting real success in spurring savings and asset building on a small scale in hundreds of communities across the country. Already 27 states have passed some form of IDA program legislation. \\n   In my home state of Connecticut, there is today only one pilot IDA program in existence. A handful of low income individuals are now starting to take part in a strong IDA program run by the Committee for Training and Employment, or CTE, a cutting edge community-based organization providing a range of services and activities to address poverty issues in the greater Stamford area. In Connecticut we are hopeful that we will soon be seeing an expansion of IDA accounts and programs. A statewide IDA Task force, convened by Connecticut State Treasurer, Denise L. Nappier, recently released a report to jump-start more IDA activity in the state. Its thoughtful analysis and authoritative recommendations will certainly help to increase IDAs in our state. The Savings for Working Families Act of 2000 was drafted in consideration of the excellent IDA work under way in states and communities all across the country. \\n   The idea is simple, but powerful. Low income workers who put their hard earned dollars into IDAs would get matching funds from financial and other private entities. A federal tax credit will provide the incentives for those private sector investments in IDAs. The IDA savings could then be used by low income working families to develop assets, specifically for the purchase of a home, the pursuit of a postsecondary education, or to start a business. In essence, this legislation extends to lower income working families the type of incentives for building assets, such as the home mortgage interest deduction, preferential capital gains rates and pension funds exclusions and incentives, that are now available on a large scale to the non-poor and wealthy. \\n   Just last week, President Clinton underscored the promise of this approach in his State of the Union Address, when he put forward his Retirement Savings Account (RSA) proposal. Those RSAs are similar to the IDAs in this bill. In his proposal, the President rightly identified the potential of the private sector in strengthening the economic security of many of our most vulnerable citizens. Just as important, he made clear, as we do in the Savings for Working Families Act, that these IDA accounts are not simply an empty promise for a handout. They are a means to integrate more Americans into the broader economic mainstream. \\n   In drafting this new IDA legislation, our objective was to keep it simple and based closely on S. 895, a bill that Senator SANTORUM and I introduced last year and that enjoyed strong bipartisan support. Modifications in the Savings for Working Families Act of 2000 are primarily technical in nature, recognizing that the IDA field has grown and evolved in the last year. We have also made a concerted effort in the new bill to realize the potential of critical private sector and nonprofit organizations to be effective IDA providers, including credit unions and community service organizations. \\n   Moving forward, we are confident that we can get this bill passed because it addresses a threat to our fundamental faith in the American dream and to the vitality and long-term stability of our national economy. Our bill cannot singlehandedly eliminate the wealth gap, but we are confident that it will help carve out a little more space in that winner\\'s circle and move us a step closer to making the American dream real for more working families. \\n   Finally, I would like to thank each of the cosponsors of this bill, especially Senators SANTORUM and ABRAHAM. Through their hard work, and in conjunction with the financial services industry and the IDA field, we have legislation that achieves a very public interest. In particular, I would like to note the leadership of the Corporation for Enterprise Development (CFED) for helping to bring the voice of the IDA community to this creation of this bill. With the Savings for Working Families Act of 2000, we are able to harness the creative forces of the marketplace to help secure our core democratic values, holding out the hope of free enterprise without the false promise of a free lunch, and giving some tangible meaning to those core values of community, opportunity and responsibility. In expanding the use of IDAs across the country as an empowerment tool for working families, this legislation speaks to our shared aspirations as Americans. \\n   Mrs. BOXER (for herself, Mr. SMITH of Oregon, and Mr. KENNEDY): \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-20000201\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota for raising this important consumer issue. Seven weeks ago, I held a forum on payday lending to help educate myself and the public on this troubling consumer credit practice. At the forum, we heard from representatives of the payday industry, consumer advocates, state regulators, and a credit union representative. We also were fortunate to hear from two Navy servicemen, one a payday borrower and one a commander who provides financial counseling to his sailors. Their stories of military personnel caught in cycles of debt to payday lenders helped me realize the impact this issue can have on individuals\\' lives. For example, Captain Robert W. Andersen, commanding officer of Patrol Squadron 30 in Jacksonville, FL, testified that sailors who take payday loans are often victims of a ``snowball effect or financial death spiral they cannot recover from.\\'\\' \\n   For those who aren\\'t familiar with payday lending, let me explain how it works. Someone who is short of cash can borrow money using his or her future paycheck as security. The borrower usually writes a check for the loan amount plus a fee, and then the lender agrees not to cash the check until after the borrower\\'s next paycheck comes in. \\n   Payday lenders commonly promote their product as quick and easy cash. But what they don\\'t usually advertise is that this is one of the most expensive consumer credit products in existence. Interest rates on payday loans average about 500 percent annually, with some loans going well over 1000 percent APR. Among the frequent borrowers who pay these high fees are those with particularly limited ability to repay the loan, including enlisted military personnel, college students, and senior citizens on fixed incomes. \\n   Despite the fact that payday loans are marketed as short-term credit, intended to help people get through one rough pay period, a disturbingly high number of payday borrowers apparently soon discover that they can\\'t pay their loan off immediately, and so they end up rolling their loan over for another--and another, and another--term. According to a study by the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions, 77 percent of all payday loan transactions are rollover transactions, and the average annual number of renewals per borrower is over ten. As a result, consumers can end up paying amounts in interest and fees that dwarf their initial loans--and make it very difficult for them to repay the principal. One borrower in Kentucky, for example, ended up paying $1,000 in fees for a loan of only $150 over a period of six months--and the borrower still owed the $150. It is cases like these that has led the Consumer Federation of America to call payday lending ``legal loan sharking.\\'\\' As the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) stated in written testimony provided for the forum:  \\n   It is not difficult to see how a borrower could become mired in debt. A person so desperate for money that he or she is willing to pay a three-digit APR is not likely to have the cash--plus the fee--two weeks after taking out a loan. . . . Taking out a loan at 391% APR, with the obligation to repay the principal and interest charge in two weeks, is not going to help consumers who do not have the cash to cover the checks they write. (emphasis in original)  \\n   And that\\'s not the worst of it: state efforts to control rollovers appear to be failing; lenders and customers find any number of ways to roll over a loan, even if rollovers are limited or prohibited. The Illinois Department of Financial Institutions has concluded that rollover rules have ``been ineffective in stopping people from converting a short term loan into a long term headache.\\'\\' At the forum, Mark Tarpey, Consumer Credit Division Supervisor with the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions, testified:  \\n   The problem with renewals is that you have an incentive for the lender to continue to collect fees as long as the customer pays them. There is no incentive to limit renewals/rollovers. Even if you statutorily prohibit or limit renewals/rollovers, you have the problem of a customer coming in and paying cash and the lender then giving them the same funds back and calling it a new loan. There are other practices to conceal transactions from being deemed a renewal/rollover.  \\n   The industry acknowledges that loan renewal is a problem, although there is dispute over just how big a problem it is. Both of the trade associations represented at the forum I held in December have adopted ``best practices\\'\\' guidelines that attempt to address this issue, but because the borrower drives the decision to renew a loan, it would be difficult for the industry guidelines to succeed. \\n   Equally disturbing are the practices that some in the payday industry have used to collect on delinquent loans--and I recognize and appreciate that the  amendment offered by the Senator from Minnesota addresses this problem. At the forum in December, Leslie Pettijohn, the Consumer Credit Commissioner in Texas, testified:  \\n   From a regulator\\'s perspective, one of the most objectionable practices of these transactions is the threat of criminal prosecution against the consumer. When a check bounces, lenders frequently file charges against consumers with law enforcement officials and attempt to collect this debt by means of criminal prosecution. In a single precinct in Dallas County, more than 13,000 of these charges were filed by these kind of companies in one year.  \\n   As I mentioned, payday lending uses as security a live check that both the borrower and the lender know is no good at the time it is written. Just as we don\\'t imprison people for failure to pay their credit card bills or meet their mortgage payments, I do not believe that a borrower--unless he committed fraud--should be subject to threat of such severe measures for failure to make good on a payday loan, particularly because the very premise of the loan was the borrower\\'s willingness to write a bad check. The amendment offered by the Senator from Minnesota would prevent the misuse of these ``bad check\\'\\' laws, but it would still permit a fraud prosecution where appropriate. That is an important step. \\n   Again, I thank the Senator from Minnesota for raising this important issue, and I look forward to working with him to address it further in the future. \\n   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-20000201\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to express my opposition to Senator LEVIN\\'s amendment, which would deny bankruptcy protection to gun companies, and to explain the reasons for my position. I intend to vote against Senator LEVIN\\'s amendment despite the fact that I have consistently supported gun control legislation. \\n   I know my colleague\\'s intentions are good, but this amendment is not the right way to address the serious problem of gun violence in our nation. It would establish a dangerous new precedent in our Bankruptcy Code, and it would unfairly discriminate against an entire category of companies, regardless of whether a given company is behaving responsibly. In Connecticut, for example, Colt\\'s Manufacturing, which has been at the forefront of developing new technologies to make guns safer, teeters at the edge of bankruptcy because it has been caught up in the tide of lawsuits against gun companies. Would it be fair to deny Colt the normal protections afforded to any company trying to reorganize? My colleague from Michigan refers to the irresponsible practices of a few gun companies, but his amendment could cripple reputable companies such as Colt\\'s. \\n   Senator LEVIN seeks to amend the Bankruptcy Code so that firearm manufacturers filing for reorganization would not be entitled to the ordinary protections from product liability lawsuits. He argues that a loophole in the bankruptcy system allows gun companies to stay lawsuits and discharge their debts. In fact, the stay of lawsuits and discharge of debts to which Senator LEVIN refers is no loophole, but is essential to the proper operation of Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. On more than one occasion, otherwise healthy companies have been hit with huge numbers of product liability cases simultaneously, and had to file for protection under Chapter 11. One recent example is Dow Corning, which filed for reorganization in response to the thousands of lawsuits over silicone breast implants, and which is now paying out claims in an orderly and expeditious process. If the lawsuits are not stayed by the bankruptcy court, then  resolved in one tribunal, the company would be more likely to fail before all claimants can litigate their cases. Chapter 11 does not allow a company to evade lawsuits, but rather to pay out claims proportionately and fairly to all claimants, hopefully in a way that keeps the company afloat. \\n   This rationale for Chapter 11 bankruptcy applies to the gun industry as well. I understand why my colleague criticizes the practices of companies such as Lorcin, which churn out the ``Saturday Night Specials\\'\\' favored by criminals. But his amendment to the Bankruptcy Code is not narrowly drafted to target those companies. Many municipalities and gun control groups have adopted a strategy of filing multiple, simultaneous product liability lawsuits, in which all gun companies are named as defendants irrespective of their particular practices. The lawsuits have not succeeded on the merits thus far, but the costs of litigation are threatening the financial viability of many of the smaller companies. \\n   Colt\\'s Manufacturing, which is among the most progressive firearms manufacturers in the country, has been drawn into the same lawsuits. Seventy percent of Colt\\'s sales are to law enforcement and defense agencies, and the company does not produce ``Saturday Night Specials.\\'\\' Although Colt\\'s has limited assets, it has been working to develop ``smart gun\\'\\' technology and other innovations that will reduce handgun violence. Nevertheless, Colt\\'s has been named as a defendant in all 29 lawsuits filed so far. Despite the fact that Colt\\'s has won four decisions and lost no final judgments, insurance companies are pulling their coverage and investors have been reluctant to provide new capital. In one year, the company has gone from 1200 to 400 employees. Colt\\'s reports that it is in financial jeopardy as a result of the lawsuits, and may soon have to file for reorganization under Chapter 11, as it did several years ago. The amendment we are considering today would be devastating to Colt\\'s. Rather then being given a chance to reorganize, the company would slowly be bled dry. Along with lost jobs in my state, the nation would lose a responsible company with a history of great craftsmanship which has been looking for solutions to the epidemic of handgun violence. \\n   No industry has ever been singled out in the Bankruptcy Code for this sort of discriminatory treatment. The case has not been made for why Chapter 11 should not apply equally to all sectors of the economy. There are many possible legislative approaches for addressing the appalling rates of gun violence in the United States, but this is not one of them. I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. \\n   Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-20000124\\n\\n    Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, since 1983, the United States Congress and the German Bundestag and Bundesrat have conducted an annual exchange program for staff members from both countries. The program gives professional staff the opportunity to observe and learn about each other\\'s political institutions and convey Members\\' views on issues of mutual concern. \\n   A staff delegation from the United States Congress will be selected to visit Germany April 7 to April 22 of this year. During the two week exchange, the delegation will attend meetings with Bundestag Members, Bundestag party staff members, and representatives of numerous political, business, academic, and media agencies. Cultural activities and a weekend visit in a Bundestag Member\\'s district will complete the schedule. \\n   A comparable delegation of German staff members will visit the United States for three weeks this summer. They will attend similar meetings here in Washington and visit the districts of Congressional Members. \\n   The Congress-Bundestag Staff Exchange is highly regarded in Germany, and is one of several exchange programs sponsored by public and private institutions in the United States and Germany to foster better understanding of the politics and policies of both countries. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19991119\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the Millennium Digital Commerce Act of 1999. I thank Senators ABRAHAM, LEAHY, and WYDEN for their leadership on this important issue. As a cosponsor of this legislation, I am proud of the steps it takes to support an important and still emerging technology and industry. The Millennium Digital Commerce Act will facilitate the continued growth of the Internet and of electronic commerce. With this legislation, the Senate recognizes the significant transformations taking place in our economy and how we do business today and into the future. \\n   I think we all recognize that we are witnessing an electronic revolution. There is no shortage of statistics to prove what we are seeing all around us. According to a recent U.S. Department of Commerce report, approximately one third of the U.S. economic growth  in the past few years has come from information technologies (over $1.1 trillion). Just this year, venture capitalists have invested more than $8 billion in Internet companies--twice the rate of last year. \\n   According to a University of Texas report, e-commerce is growing at a much faster rate than many had expected. The digital economy generated more than $300 billion in revenue in 1998 and was responsible for 1.2 million jobs. Many e-commerce companies in my State of Connecticut, like Micro-Warehouse in Norwalk, Coastal Tool & Supply in West Hartford, and Sagemaker Inc. of Fairfield, are leading the way in the digital economy. \\n   In the Senate, I have worked to support the growth of e-commerce by cosponsoring the Internet Tax Freedom Act which places a three year moratorium on new state and local taxes on the Internet in order to give the digital economy some breathing room to evolve. \\n   This legislation takes further steps to continue the growth of e-commerce and is a powerful follow-on to the Internet Tax Freedom Act. With this legislation we will eliminate a major barrier to e-commerce by providing for the legal recognition of electronic signatures in contracting and by creating a consistent, but temporary, national electronic signatures law to preempt a multitude of sometimes inconsistent state laws. This bill is technology neutral, allowing contracting parties to determine the appropriate electronic signature technology for their transaction. Importantly, this legislation is the result of thoughtful compromise. It gives electronic signatures more legal certainty but also provides for consumer protection. It deals with electronic signatures only in creating contracts. It preempts state law only until the states enact their own statutes and standards as provided for by the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA). \\n   Mr. President, I would like to thank those who have worked so diligently to create this Act. Through the considerate and collaborative approach of several of my colleagues, including Senators ABRAHAM, LEAHY, and WYDEN, we now have legislation with language that achieves a broad public purpose. We are now able to continue supporting the growth and evolution of electronic commerce and technologies that will effectively bring us into the next century. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-2-19991119\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN.

Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the tax extenders package included in the Work Incentives Act conference report. In the context of our current budget situation of a small projected on-budget surplus for FY 2000, I believe this tax package strikes an important balance between fiscal responsibility and tax relief. \\n   Although I would have preferred a fully offset tax package, I am pleased that the bill is fully offset for FY2000 and partially offset for FY2001, the two years for which most of the tax provisions are extended by law. If two years from now when we reconsider most of these provisions a on-budget surplus does not exist, I will push for an extenders package that is fully offset to ensure that we do not go into deficit as a result of tax relief measures. \\n   The package includes several important provisions that I strongly support. The Research and Experimentation Tax Credit is important for our future international competitiveness. This tax credit provides an important incentive for our companies to research and innovate. I hope that in the near future we will update this credit to reflect current business conditions and to make it a permanent part of the tax code. \\n   The AMT modification, the Worker Opportunity Tax Credit, and the Welfare-to-Work Tax Credit are all important provisions to help low to moderate income earners create more opportunities and to improve their living standards. I am pleased that the Finance Committee decided to include renewal of the Generalized System of Preferences in this tax package. This is a critical program for promoting growth in developing economies and for increasing international trade integration. \\n   I strongly support the provision to extend and modify the tax credit for electricity produced by wind and biomass materials. In order to ensure energy security and address national environmental priorities such as clean air and mitigation of global climate change, it is essential that renewable energy options become more competitive. These tax provisions will ensure that renewable energy technologies will be able to compete more equitably with fossil sources such as coal and oil. However, while this package includes modest extensions and modifications, I am disappointed that the bill does not go further by extending the credit to include landfill methane and other cellulosic feedstocks. \\n   I would like to thank Chairman ROTH and Senator MOYNIHAN for their hard work in getting this package together. It is a fiscally responsible and an appropriate package under our current fiscal situation. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19991119\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today with renewed hope for the safety of our public roads. In 1998, 5,374 people were killed in truck-related crashes. In my State there is a strong public sense of alarm about this safety problem. And as trucks get bigger and heavier and the volume of trucks on our roads increases, the General Accounting Office (GAO) predicts that by the year 2000, over 6,000 people will be killed every year as a result of truck-related crashes. This prediction comes at a time when the Office of Motor Carriers (OMC)--the federal agency charged with overseeing truck safety--has failed in its duties to protect the American public. The Department of Transportation Inspector General, the National Transportation Safety Board, the GAO and members of this Congress have all brought to light and documented the many inadequacies of this broken agency. \\n   I commend the leaders of the Senate Commerce Committee for pursuing this very important issue. H.R. 3419, The Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Act of 1999, addresses the numerous failings of the Office of Motor Carriers by strengthening federal motor carrier safety programs, and by creating a new Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. Although H.R. 3419 takes a large step in the right direction, federal truck safety oversight needs a new look, with a focus dedicated to reducing truck-related fatalities and injuries, and not simply a new agency with new letterhead. \\n   The Inspector General in his April 1999 report showed that the OMC has not maintained an ``arm\\'s length\\'\\' relationship between itself and the industry it regulates. In fact, the report suggests OMC has developed too close a relationship with the industry it must regulate. This has limited OMC in taking the tough regulatory and enforcement actions that the accident data suggests are needed to protect public safety. One example of this problem is that the OMC has consistently awarded research contracts to the regulated industry to perform some of the most critical, and highly sensitive research on future rulemakings governing the industry. This practice appears questionable. In order to protect the American public, an independent relationship should be established by the new Federal Motor Carrier Administration. \\n   H.R. 3419 provides us with an opportunity for real progress in improving truck safety, but only if the new Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration and its leaders commit to a new culture which truly holds safety as the highest priority. This Congress and the Department of Transportation must restore the American public\\'s trust in federal motor carrier safety programs, and take action that produces safer results. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19991119\\n\\n    Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join today with Senator THOMPSON in introducing the Government Information Security Act of 1999. This bill would put a management structure in place for the implementation of risk-based computer security measures across the government. \\n   We are introducing this bill in the closing days of this session with the hope that it will serve as the basis for launching a discussion about the most effective ways to improve government\\'s approach to computer security. We invite and look forward to comments from government agencies, industry and academic experts, think tanks and others who have been involved in this field. \\n   Like the rest of the nation,the government is increasingly dependent on computer and other electronic information systems to collect, analyze and preserve important data and perform vital tasks. Government computer systems are rife with sensitive information pertaining to the fundamentals of our existence--our national security, the strength of our economy, transportation and communications systems, and the personal lives of millions of individual citizens. The Department of Defense and other national security agencies control our weapons of mass destruction and track the offensive movements of enemy states through complex computer programs; the Internal Revenue Service maintains an automated systems wage information on every working American; the Federal Reserve calculates key economic indicators electronically and the Center for Disease Control relies on computers to tracks threats to the nation\\'s public health. \\n   And yet, this computer-reliant infrastructure is frighteningly vulnerable to exploitation not only by trouble-makers and professional hackers but by organized crime and international terrorists. Indeed, a disruption of our communications, transportation and energy sections could prove as destructive as any conventional weapons attack to our ability to defend our privacy, our safety, even our freedom. \\n   Indeed, witnesses before the Governmental Affairs Committee last Congress testified that the government\\'s reliance on computer systems is not matched by a concomitant growth in the security of those systems. A series of Government Accounting Office studies found government computer security so lax that it landed on the GAO\\'s list of ``high risk\\'\\' government programs. For example, this year, GAO reported that one of its test teams gained access to mission critical computer systems at NASA which would have allowed the team to control spacecraft or alter data returned from space. In May 1998, the GAO was able to gain unauthorized access to the State Department\\'s networks which would have enabled GAO to modify, delete or download important data and shutdown services. And the GAO reported in September 1998 that inadequate information system controls by the Veterans Administration threatened the disruption or misuse of service delivery to the men and women who have fought our wars. \\n   Less significant on a global scale, but of utmost concern to individual citizens is the extent to which inadequate security leaves personal information, and therefore people, vulnerable to exposure and exploitation. Our legislation will address personal information maintained by the government such as benefits and tax data and demographics culled from personal information we supply to the Census Bureau. \\n   While the GAO\\'s work is compelling, I am convinced by two other developments that legislation in this area needs to be addressed quickly. First, we have been intensely focused throughout the year on fixing the computer problems associated with Y2K. Ensuring that the information our government collects and produces is secure may seem similar to the Y2K issue because both reflect our dependency on computers and their vulnerability to programming failures and outside disruptions. The need for secure government computer systems, however, will not disappear in the first days and weeks of the year 2000. Indeed, it will be with us until we have a structure within the government dedicated to fixing these problems. \\n   Second,we have spent significant time this session digging into the Los Alamo National Laboratory espionage scandal and allegations that an employee improperly downloaded classified material to an unclassified computer. The Energy and Justice Departments are still looking into this breach of security, but it should focus everyone\\'s attention on the vulnerability associated with extensive reliance computers and the undeniable need for improvements in how we manage and secure these systems. \\n   Mr. President, the goal of the bill we are introducing today is to protect the integrity, confidentiality and availability of information and ensure that critical improvements in the management of our computer security system take place. Specifically, our bill would: \\n   Require high-level accountability. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget will be accountable for overseeing policy while the agency heads will be accountable for developing specific security plans. \\n   Require agency heads to develop and implement security plans and policies based on the appropriate level of risk for the different type of information the agency maintains. We need to ensure that each agency\\'s plan reflects an understanding that computer security must be an integral part of the development process for any new system. Agencies now tend to develop a system and consider security issues only as an afterthought, if at all. \\n   Establish an ongoing, periodic reporting, testing and evaluation process to gauge the effectiveness of the policies and procedures. This would be accomplished through agency budgets, program performance and financial management. \\n   Require an independent, annual audit of all information security practices and programs within an agency. The audit would be conducted either by the agency\\'s Inspector General, GAO or an independent external auditor. GAO has told us that an audit requirement is essential to monitoring agencies\\' management of information security and to ensure that these systems are kept current. \\n   Require that agencies report unauthorized intrusions into government systems. GSA currently has a program where agencies can report and seek help to respond to intrusions into their information systems and share information concerning common vulnerabilities and threats. Our bill would require agencies to use this reporting and monitoring system. \\n   Mr. President, the provisions of this bill would apply to all information, including classified and unclassified information maintained on civilian and national security systems. We are also considering whether the bill\\'s provisions should apply to government owned, contractor operated facilities including laboratories engaged in national defense research. We look forward to discussions with the defense and intelligence communities on how best to address these issues. \\n   There are a number of areas we have not addressed, and I welcome comments on how best to handle these areas. For example: \\n   We need to ensure that computer security systems will not interfere with the ability of agencies to share data and communicate with each other and the rest of the world. The new era of ``e-business\\'\\' and ``e-government\\'\\' holds untold opportunities for improving government efficiency, and that\\'s something we want to encourage. \\n   The government needs to rapidly and safely increase the number of trained technical information security professionals. There are a range of approaches to addressing this need, including incentives to universities to train more people in this area; contracting out to the private sector; establishing a CyberCorps at universities based on the ROTC model; or establishing special career designations for personnel specializing in computer security.  \\n   We should consider whether current technology will meet the government\\'s computer security needs or whether we need to develop incentives for technology development. A Presidential advisory committee is developing recommendations based on a national laboratory model to conduct research and development of security technology with a possible secondary focus on testing. \\n   We are interested in exploring whether provisions in this bill addressing risk and technology standards, which are now voluntary, consensus-based standards, should be issued as minimum mandatory requirements for successive levels of risk. \\n   And we will also consider issues relating to budgetary needs, privacy requirements, performance measures and how best to coordinate information security and management within the federal government. \\n   Mr. President, I expect what we have proposed will generate a hearty debate. As I have said, I consider this bill a work in progress, so I look forward to hearing from a wide range of interested parties and to working with the Chairman to craft the best possible legislation to protect the integrity and the confidentiality of the government\\'s vast storehouse of information. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19991119\\n\\n    Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, the week of Nov. 21-28 is an important time for houses of worship and individuals of all religions across the country--National Bible Week. \\n   As this year\\'s National Bible Week co-chair, it is my privilege to pay tribute to the Bible and its remarkable influence on American life. As in past years, the National Bible Association is hosting the week-long salute to the Good Book. This year, the tribute happens to fall during the Thanksgiving holidays; this seems fitting, because we should be eternally thankful that we have the teachings of the Bible to help guide our daily lives. \\n   And old maxim states that ``A reformation happens every time you open the Bible.\\'\\' Indeed, no book over the course of human history has had a more profound effect on how we live and act. The Bible has influenced Western culture in myriad ways, shaping areas as diverse as government and art. \\n   John Wycliffe, the great religious reformer, once wrote, ``The Bible is for the government of the people, by the people, and for the people.\\'\\' The writings found within it inspired many of our nation\\'s founders\\' most cherished ideals--ideals that remain cornerstones of democracy today. The Bible, for example, advocates faith in a greater good, the glory of freedom, the importance of family, and the sanctity of every human life. The Bible is at the heart of America\\'s civic religion. \\n   Far from archaic, the Bible is as important today as it has ever been, particularly as many Americans feel this country slipping into moral decline. Our best hope of righting our national ship is to instill in future generations the core values of love, truth, honor, and service enshrined in the Bible. \\n   As an Orthodox Jew, my faith orders my life, gives me a sense of purpose and direction, and provides comfort in uncertain or difficult times. The Old Testament or Torah serves as a constant reminder of my obligations to God, country, and family. \\n   So as Thanksgiving approaches, I encourage every believer in this land to open the Bible, read a favorite passage or two, and give thanks to God for this wonderful, sacred Book.  \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19991116\\n\\n    Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Pfizer, Inc. on its 150th anniversary. As one of the global leaders of the important pharmaceutical industry, Pfizer has helped to improve the health of men, women and children around the world for the last century and a half. The company employs 4,939 men and women in its Groton, CT research facility, which lies in my home state. \\n   Pfizer is committed to helping people live better lives--not only by bringing best-in-class medicines to market, but also by working with patients and physicians to develop comprehensive disease management programs that educate people about ways to better control their illness, rather than letting their illness control them. \\n   Pfizer\\'s long history is full of adventure, daring risk-taking, and intrepid decision-making. Founded by German immigrant cousins Charles Pfizer and Charles Erhart in 1849, Pfizer has grown from a small chemical firm in Brooklyn, NY to a multinational corporation, which employs close to 50,000 people. \\n   Pfizer has a long tradition of developing innovative drugs to combat a variety of illnesses. In 1944, Pfizer was the first company to successfully mass-produce penicillin, a breakthrough that led to the company\\'s emergence as a global leader in its industry. Since then, Pfizer has marketed dozens of effective medicines designed to fight conditions like arthritis, diabetes, heart disease, and infections. Nearly all of the major medicines marketed by Pfizer are No. 1 or No. 2 in their categories \\n   In addition, Pfizer provides a wide range of assistance to those in need. The desire to live a healthy life is universal. But for millions of people around the world, access to high quality health care remains out of reach. Pfizer is committed to bringing their medicines to those in need. Through Sharing the Care, a program started in 1993, Pfizer has filled more than 3.0 million prescriptions for its medicines--valued at over $170 million--for more than one million uninsured patients in the United States. The program was cited by American Benefactor, a leading philanthropy journal, in selecting Pfizer as one of America\\'s 25 most generous companies for 1998. \\n   As you can see, Pfizer has made innumerable contributions to our nation and our world, and its accomplishments should be applauded as it celebrates its 150th anniversary. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19991110\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak briefly about an issue which has surfaced recently in the national press, and now arises with regard to the remaining appropriations bills before us. On November 3rd, the Justice Department filed seven lawsuits on behalf of EPA against electric utility companies in the Midwest and South. The lawsuit charged that 17 power plants illegally polluted the air by failing to install pollution control equipment when they were making major modifications to their plants. This action is one of the largest enforcement investigations in EPA\\'s history, and seeks to control pollution which contributes to degraded air quality throughout the Northeast. I have recently learned that some of the defendants may be seeking relief from this enforcement action by adding a rider to one of the remaining appropriations bills. I am speaking with my colleagues here today in strong opposition to this effort. To seek relief for pending violations of federal law through a rider without any congressional hearing, debate, or voting record, is utterly inappropriate. It undermines the democratic process which is constitutionally guaranteed to American citizens, and to the states which have similar cases pending. \\n   The alleged violations are extremely serious. Congress has long recognized the need to control transported air pollution. Provisions to study and address the issue have been included by major amendments to the Clean Air Act. Yet the problem still remains and the statistics are staggering. They demonstrate just how much older, Midwestern powerplants contribute to air pollution in the Northeast. For example, one utility in Michigan emits almost 6 times more nitrogen oxides than all the utilities in the entire state of Connecticut. Ohio power plants produce nearly 9,000 tons a day of sulfur dioxide, which directly contributes to acid rain. One single plant in Ohio produces as much nitrogen oxide as all of the plants in the state of New York. Approximately 67 million people east of the Mississippi River live in area with unhealthy levels of smog. EPA estimates that every year that implementation of regional pollution controls are delayed, there are between 200-800 premature deaths, thousands of additional incidences of moderate to severe respiratory symptoms in children, and hundreds of thousands of children suffering from breathing difficulties. Now these polluting power plants want special relief during the court\\'s review. \\n   The alleged violations result from a portion of the Clean Air Act that many refer to as the ``grandfathering\\'\\' provisions. When the Clean Air Act was amended in 1970 and 1977, there were two categories of requirements: those for existing power plants, and those for new sources. At the time, most people envisioned that the older coal burning plants would soon be retired, making the additional controls for old plants unnecessary. Instead, the life span of older coal fired plants has been extended by modifications to their facilities. Many of the older coal fired plants have stayed around for three decades; and coal power plants are now the largest industrial source of smog pollution. Of the approximately 1,000 power plants operating today, 500 were built before modern pollution control requirements went into effect. \\n   Although the Clean Air Act did exempt older plants from the new standards, it required that the plants meet a test of ``prevention of significant deterioration\\'\\' to protect the public when a plant undertook a major modification. Although the definition of ``major modification\\'\\' has been debated, Section 111 of the Clean Air Act clearly states that a modification means ``any physical change.......which increases the amount of any air pollutant emitted by such source or which results in the emission of any air pollutant not previously emitted.\\'\\' What is at stake in the recent enforcement action is the question of whether the power plants undertook major modifications without installing state of the art pollution controls, in violation of this Clean Air Act requirement. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-2-19991110\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Certainly. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-3-19991110\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Yes. With this rider, Congress would be substituting its opinion for the factual and legal analysis by the court. There will be no opportunity for expert opinions to be heard. In fact, I understand there may even be discussions about trying to add rider language which would allow modifications which would result in significant increases in emissions, by basing them on a unit\\'s potential to emit pollution. This change is a significant departure from the current law, which requires that pollution controls be included when plants are making modifications that cause emissions to increase. For example, a plant\\'s potential to emit pollution may be at 10 tons, while it actually emits 7. The test has been that if modifications are made that raise emissions above the 7 tons, pollution controls are required to be instituted. Since the \\n   potential emissions are often much greater than actual emissions, actual emissions have been the threshold to trigger public health protections. A rider that would seek to allow modifications to go forward would give utilities a license to continue to pollute our air while the enforcement action is pending. In its worst form, it would also ``pre-judge\\'\\' the court\\'s determination on these matters. These are major reasons why I oppose using a rider to address this issue. It makes no sense for Congress to make a statement on this complex issue with no opportunity for public deliberation. I yield back to my colleague from Massachusetts. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-4-19991110\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Thank you. Certainly, many of our constituents have concerns about how cost and service delivery would be implicated under any enforcement action. If the court were to impose fines and injunctive requirements which would force power companies to go out of business, I think we would all join in opposing that outcome. Yet time and again, we hear claims that such dire outcomes will occur when we ask companies to comply with the law. But the evidence shows that environmental goals are being met without sacrificing economic growth. In this circumstance, I believe the Department of Justice and EPA have been clear that their objective, if the violations are found to have occurred, is to require that the utilities make appropriate investments in pollution control. In fact, EPA has a demonstrated record on the kind of remedy it has sought in a similar case that involved another segment of industry. \\n   EPA recently undertook a similar enforcement action against the paper and pulp industry for similar major New Source Review violations. After looking into the paper and pulp sector as part of its Wood Products Initiative, the EPA found New Source Review violations at roughly 70-80 percent of the facilities it investigated. Through its enforcement action, EPA was able to work with industry to generate emission reductions as high as 500 tons of volatile organic compounds. However, these enforcement actions did not require that controls be put in all at once. Rather, a schedule was created to phase in controls so that the pollution controls were instituted in a way that protected the public without crippling the industry. It is disingenuous to argue that we need a preemptive rider to protect against what the outcome of the pending enforcement action might be. There is a history of enforcement decisions which demonstrate that the courts secure remedies that protect the public\\'s interest, and that EPA has had a willingness to work with industry to that end. \\n   Fundamentally what we are addressing here is a matter of fairness. Right now utilities in Southern and Midwestern states emit over 4.5 times more nitrogen oxides than utilities in the Northeast. A study by the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management found that northeastern states will have to pay between $1.4 and $3.9 billion for additional local controls to reduce ozone pollution if six upwind states fail to implement needed controls. I notice that my colleague from Vermont is here. I yield the floor for him to offer some remarks about how the equity issue is particularly important within a deregulated marketplace. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-5-19991110\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my colleague from Vermont. As you have argued in the past, the 1970 Clean Air Act Amendments assumed that one of the major sources of these pollutants--older power plants--would be retired and replaced with cleaner burning plants. Unfortunately, this has not happened. The average power plant in the United States uses technology devised in the 1950\\'s or before. The EPA-DOJ enforcement action is now alleging that many of these generating units have been modified and are no longer entitled to their grandfathered status. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19991110\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for S. 1798, the American Inventors Protection Act. Yesterday I became a co-sponsor of the patents reform legislation, which was recently reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee. It is my understanding that the provisions contained in that legislation are being folded into a larger bill, which also addresses satellite television and other matters. Although I urge passage of this larger bill, in my comments today I will speak only to the provisions dealing with patent reform and inventor protection, provisions which I strongly believe will provide vital new protections both to businesses and to individual inventors. In particular, I am pleased to see an entire title dedicated to regulating invention promoters, many of whom are little more than con artists. In 1995 I introduced the ``Inventor Protection Act\\'\\' of 1995, which was the first bill to target the unsrupulous firms that take advantage of inventors\\' ideas and dreams. Several of my bill\\'s provisions now appear in the House and Senate legislation, and I am glad to see that the work we did in the 104th Congress, combined with the efforts of others since, should finally result in the passage of long needed protections against invention promotion scams. \\n   The American Inventors Protection Act is a well-rounded bill. It reduces patent fees and authorizes the Comissioner of the Paetnt and Trademark Office (PTO) to report to Congress on alternative fee structures. The goal here, as with other titles of the legislation, is to make our patent system as accessible as possible to all. Another reform would save money for parties to a patent dispute. It allows third parties the option of expanded inter pates reexamination procedures; these new procedures before the PTO will decrease the amount of litigation in federal district court. \\n   The ``First Inventor Defense\\'\\' is a vital new provision for businesses and other inventors caught unaware by recent court decisions allowing business methods to be patented. It is simply unfair that an innovator of a particular business method should suddenly have to pay royalties for its own invention, just because of an unforeseeable change in patent law. It is my understanding that any kind of method, regardless of its technological character, would be included within the scope of this definition, provided it is used in some manner by a company or other entity in the conduct of its business. \\n   Two other provisions provide greater predictability and fairness for inventors. One title guarantees a minimum patent term of 17 years by extending patent term in cases of unusual delay. Another allows for domestic publication of patent applications subject to foreign publication. I support the changes made to this provision since the last Congress, changes which should satisfy the concerns of independent inventors that their ideas might be copied before their patents are granted. \\n   Finally, I applaud the new regulations and remedies which will provide inventors with enhanced protections against invention promotion scams. Each year thousands of inventors lose tens of millions of dollars to deceptive invention marketing companies. In 1994, as then-Chairman of the Subcommittee on Regulation and Governmental Affairs, I held a hearing on the problems presented by the invention marketing industry. Witness after witness testified how dozens of companies, under broad claims of helping inventors, had actually set up schemes in which inventors spend thousands for services to market their invention--a service that companies regularly fail to provide. \\n   The legislation I introduced in 1995 used a multi-faceted approach to separate the legitimate companies from the fraudulent and guarantee real protection for America\\'s inventors. I am gratified that a number of the provisions from my bill have been used in a title of this year\\'s patent reform legislation specially devoted to invention marketing companies. Both bills provide inventors with enhanced protections against invention promotion scams by creating a private right of action for inventors harmed by deceptive fraudulent practices, by requiring invention promoters to disclose certain information in writing prior to entering into a contract for invention promotion services, and by creating a publicly available log of complaints received by the PTO involving invention promotes. \\n   The provisions contained in the American Inventors Protection Act represent our best hope for passage of meaningful patent reform. I urge my colleagues to support their passage to ensure that inventors as well as their ideas are adequately protected. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19991110\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the Secretary of Defense, Bill Cohen, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Hugh Shelton, the Commander in Chief Joint Forces Command Admiral Hal Gehman, and the Army Chief of Staff, General Eric Shinseki for their commitment to transforming our current military force to one which will assure our military superiority well into the twenty first century. \\n   Secretary Cohen and General Shelton have taken strong and direct action to establish transformation as the guiding policy for the Department of Defense.  Their leadership responds to what are now broadly accepted conclusions about the security environment we will face and the challenges and opportunities resulting from the Revolution in Military Affairs. Many, both inside and outside the Pentagon, have concluded that these changes are of such magnitude that they require that our military in the twenty first century be fundamentally different than today\\'s military. This view was compellingly articulated by the National Defense Panel, which was created by this body. And it was given the force of policy by Secretary Cohen in the Quadrennial Defense Review. \\n   But how are we to know what this very different military should look like? Secretary Cohen and General Shelton, encouraged and supported by legislation we passed last year, established a process to answer that question. On the first of October, 1998, they charged the Commander in Chief of the United States Atlantic Command, Admiral Harold Gehman, to put in place a joint experimentation process to objectively determine which new technologies, organizations, and concepts of operation will most likely to future military superiority. Since that time Admiral Theman has done a superb job of establishing a process and beginning experiments toward that end. In June, 1999, Admiral Gehman began experiments to address how the U.S. military should be equipped and organized to effectively find and strike critical mobile enemy targets, such as ballistic missiles. Other experiments to address near, mid, and far term strategic and operational problems will follow. On the first of October of this year the Secretary and the Chairman increased the priority of the policy of transformation by redesignating the United States Atlantic Command as the United States Joint Forces Command. This change is more than simply a change in name. It underlines the increasing importance of increased jointness in meeting the security challenges of the twenty first century, increases the priority assigned to experimentation, and reflects the expanded role that the United States Joint Forces Command assumes in order to achieve that goal. I applaud Secretary Cohen and General Shelton for their commitment to transformation of the U.S. military and their courage to make the tough changes needed to get it done. \\n   I am also pleased to see that their leadership is having a positive effect on our military Services\\' plans to transform themselves to meet the coming challenges. The U.S. Air Force has begun to reorganize its units into Air Expeditionary Forces to be more responsive to the need for air power by the warfighting commanders. And I note with great admiration that on October 12, 1999 General Eric Shinseki, Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army, announced his intention to begin to transform the U.S. Army from a heavy force designed largely for the Cold War to one that will be more effective against the threats that most now see as most likely and most dangerous. The goal is to make the U.S. Army more strategically relevant by making it lighter, more deployable, more lethal, and more sustainable. General Shinseki plans to find technological solutions to these problems, and intends to create this year an experimentation process at Fort Lewis Washington in order to begin to construct this new force. He has said that he wants to eliminate the distinction between different types of Army units, and perhaps in time go to an all-wheeled fleet of combat vehicles, eliminating the tank as we have known it for almost a century. These are historic and very positive steps. But there is much progress that must still be made. For example, the Army and the Air Force must now implement their plans in concert with the other services, and with the Joint Forces Command. \\n   Fundamental change is very difficult to effect, especially in organizations, like the Department of Defense, that are large and successful. Frankly, I am a little surprised that we have been able to achieve these changes in so short time. But organizations that don\\'t change ultimately fail, and that is not an outcome we can accept. So we should not only applaud these moves, but support them, and encourage faster and more direct action. An excellent report by the Defense Science Board in August, 1999 suggests some things we can do to provide this support. The most important are encouraging the development of a DOD-wide strategy for transformation activities, and insisting on the establishment of processes to turn the results of experiments into real capabilities for our forces. And we must ensure that this effort is not hobbled by lack of resources. Perhaps most importantly, we must insist that no Service plan nor program be agreed to or resourced unless we are assured that it has passed through a rigorous joint assessment and is consistent with the joint warfighting needs of our military commanders. \\n   I urge my colleagues to join me in complementing our senior leaders and to support their efforts to move to the next level of jointness as they grapple with the difficult task of building the most effective American military possible for the 21st century. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19991110\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, we have just marked the 10th anniversary of the fall of the Berln Wall, one of the most important milestones of our era. In honor of this event, I am submitting a resolution urging that a ``Freedom Day\\'\\' be celebrated each year in the United States. It also calls on the United States to work with other nations to establish a global holiday called ``Freedom Day.\\'\\' The House already passed an identical resolution, introduced by my friend House Policy Chairman CHRISTOPHER COX, by a vote of 417-0, and it is my hope that we can pass it in the Senate before adjournment. \\n   A decade later, it is sometimes easy to forget the profound significance of November 9, 1989, the day that Berlin Wall came down. It was the symbolic end of four decades of a Cold War that had dominated our foreign and defense policies and threatened international stability. The Cold War\\'s end was a resounding success for the United States and the international community, that set off a worldwide movement toward greater democratization and the embrace of free markets. \\n   In the United States, credit for this success can be generously distributed to generations of American leaders, both Democrats and Republicans, who never wavered in their courageous determination to contain the Soviet Union and resist totalitarianism. The end of the Cold War was truly a bi-partisan effort and a national achievement, and is a model of cooperation that we should not forget as we seek to address the international concerns we face now and in the future. \\n   The fall of the wall was a transcendent moment in the struggle against totalitarianism and for democracy, a smashing victory for the human spirit and the cause of human rights. It is only fitting that we choose the anniversary of this epochal triumph to honor and celebrate freedom\\'s march of progress across the planet. \\n   This effort to establish a ``Freedom Day,\\'\\' in recognition of the end of the Cold War, was inspired by my good friend Ben Wattenberg, Senior Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and a long time champion of freedom and democracy. His recent column entitled ``moving Forward With Freedom Day\\'\\' is particularly noteworthy. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19991109\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in memory and tribute to Senator John H. Chafee, who was for me not just a colleague and friend, but a mentor on the Environment and Public Works Committee for the eleven years I have been in the Senate. Nearly every single environmental statute bears the strong stamp of his commitment and leadership; Superfund, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, barrier beach legislation, transportation laws, the Oil Pollution Protection Act. The list goes on and on. \\n   When John Chafee first announced that he was not going to run for reelection, a lot of us who care about the environment realized what a great loss John Chafee\\'s retirement would be. Now his sudden death reminds us all too quickly that he was an irreplaceable friend of the environment. He was a very sturdy, forthright, faithful leader at a time when the number of legislators in his great party who consider themselves environmental stewards grew smaller. This trend has been contrary to the proud environmental tradition of the Republican party that goes back to the days of Teddy Roosevelt and contrary to what I find to be the opinion of Republicans in Connecticut who are quite enthusiastically supportive of environmental protection. Senator Chafee held high the banner of that tradition. \\n   He always considered himself a centrist and I know that what he meant by that was not that he was neutral, but that he was committed to bringing different groups and factions within Congress and outside together to get things done. One of my first and best experiences as a Senator was in 1990 when we were considering the Clean Air Act Amendments. Senator George Mitchell, then Majority Leader, pulled a group of us together with representatives of the Bush Administration in his conference room. John Chafee was there day after day, and night after night, throughout long, tedious negotiations. But in the end, he helped put the pieces together for us to adopt a bill signed by President Bush that has clearly made our nation\\'s air healthier and cleaner. \\n   He was also a leader in the effort to protect against global climate change, urging the President to adopt an international framework to address the issue as early as 1988, and supporting the efforts to achieve the signing and ratification of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. We went to Kyoto, Japan for the critical meetings there to forge further agreements to fulfill the objectives of the Framework Convention agreement. In that difficult setting John sent a message to the countries of the world which were being quite critical of the United States\\' position, that there was bipartisan support in Congress for taking action to address global warming. He and I then worked together with Senator MACK to sponsor what we thought was a modest proposal in this Congress to begin to give companies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions the promise of credit if and when we adopt a mandatory system for controlling that kind of air pollution. I remember laughing with John that we must be on the right path because our proposal was opposed by both sides of the debate. \\n   John Chafee was the quintessential New Englander; he was a straightforward, very honest, very civil man. He also was a great outdoorsman. I think that some of the work he was proudest of involved his efforts to protect natural resources. He played a critical role in expanding our National Wildlife Refuge System and worked hard to conserve wetlands. He instituted several reforms to tax policy to encourage the preservation of open space. He was a great advocate right up to his death for full and permanent funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which is so important to preserving open spaces in our states. \\n   John Chafee was a good man and a superb chairman. Always respectful to those who came before our Committee, he wanted to get things done. When it came to the environment, he really did get things done. I\\'ll miss him. We\\'ll all miss him. The Lord\\'s good earth will miss him, because he was indeed a good friend. My wife Hadassah joins me in extending condolences to Ginny Chafee and the entire family. We all do truly share in their loss. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19991109\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to make additional remarks on a provision contained in the Manager\\'s Amendment to the Trade and Development Act of 1999 adopted last week by voice vote. The manager\\'s included a Sense of the Senate on Tariff Inversions that has raised some concerns with several of my colleagues. I would like to engage them in a discussion of the issue on the floor of the United States Senate. \\n   There is a company in my state, The Warren Corporation, that specializes in the manufacture of high quality woolen and worsted apparel fabric. This company has been producing luxurious  fabrics for decades and recently invested heavily in the U.S. to become a fully integrated textile mill with a diverse set of manufacturing operations. I mention Warren today because this proud contributor to the New England textile heritage could be adversely affected by a tariff provision recently adopted by voice vote in the Manager\\'s Amendment to the Trade and Development Act of 1999. I would like to call on some of my esteemed colleagues who I am sure have similar concerns in their states. Senator HELMS, is it not true that you have thousands of workers in the textile industry that could be adversely affected by this legislation. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-2-19991109\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. And Senator THOMAS, am I correct in noting that 23 distinguished members of this body submitted a letter to the Chairman of the Finance Committee earlier this year expressing concern over legislation that would threaten domestic textile producers? \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-3-19991109\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my colleague from Wyoming for his kind words. On November 3, I presented legislative background on the wool tariff provision to reflect the concerns of my constituents about any revision to tariff reduction and phase-out schedules that would unfairly alter their competitive posture and force layoffs. Specifically, I noted that the language in the provision as originally proposed dinting the inclusion of the wool fabric industry was purposely deleted in the version that passed in the Manager\\'s Amendment, underscoring the Senate\\'s clear intent that this provision is not directed at this sector. \\n   Second, the provision specifically requires that full account be taken of ``conditions\\'\\' in the various ``producing industry in the United States,\\'\\' indicating that whatever further action Congress may want to consider in the future on this issue, or that the U.S. Trade Representative may raise in future negotiations, must assure fairness and equitable treatment to those currently producing in the United States. Furthermore, the language specifically states that special attention and equity is to be provided to ``those currently facing tariff phase-outs negotaited under prior trade agreements.\\'\\' Since my constituents in the wool fabrication sector specifically fall into exactly that posture, property relying on phase-out schedules negotiated in prior trade agreements, this protection and assurance is directed at their concerns, which, in turn, is why their industry sector was dropped from application of this provision. \\n   Senator HELMS, is it not true that Senators MOYNIHAN and ROTH provided assurances that I would be given full notice of any consideration of this issue in conference and that it will be resolved in a manner satisfactory to me in representative of my constituents concerns? \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-4-19991109\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, we have reiterated our concerns concerning the wool tariff provision with the hope that the leadership will find a way to support the views of nearly one quarter of the Senate. I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD a letter from April 16, 1999, from 23 Senators opposed by any changes in wood tariffs addressed to Senator ROTH. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19991104\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999. The Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 is landmark legislation that provides for a historic modernization of our financial services system. This legislation is the culmination of years of effort on the part of several Congresses, several administrations, and federal financial regulators. Passing this legislation will eliminate inefficiencies and unnecessary barriers in our economy that were created by the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 and other laws passed generations ago. \\n   With this legislation, the Congress recognizes the significant transformations taking place in our economy and its financial services sector. Through this Act, Congress makes the necessary and critical leaps for our financial services sector to catch up with the realities of a marketplace and economy driven by an information technology revolution. The changes created through this legislation are inevitable. They overhaul laws implemented decades ago that have not withstood the test of time and that have increasingly been bypassed through more and more regulatory loopholes. Passing the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 will create a rational financial structure in the U.S., the world\\'s largest economy, that will be competitive in the global economy. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this legislation. \\n   By updating laws separating banks, securities firms, and insurance companies, this Act will result in a broader array of financial services and products for consumers. It will spur innovation in the financial services industry and create a more competitive marketplace where powerful new products come to market more quickly and at a lower cost to consumers. It will lead to the creation of an array of new products for consumers and at the same time will help them to make their choices more intelligently and efficiently by allowing for one-stop shopping for a multitude of financial services. \\n   Specifically, by overriding sections of the Glass-Steagall Act and other federal and state laws, this legislation will allow banks, insurance companies, and security firms to more easily merge or otherwise enter one another\\'s businesses. \\n   While allowing the industry greater flexibility to provide services, this legislation also protects consumer privacy by requiring financial institutions to create privacy policies and spell them out to consumers. Financial institutions will have to provide notice of how they share the financial information of their customers and with certain exceptions they would be prohibited from disclosing personally identifiable financial information to non-affiliated third parties without first giving consumers the opportunity to ``opt out\\'\\'. The legislation gives regulatory agencies the authority to enforce those privacy protections. \\n   Importantly, this legislation also retains key parts of the 1977 Community Reinvestment Act. Any financial services company that is out of compliance  with that Act would not be allowed to take advantage of mergers and other benefits outlined under this legislation. It is right that the Administration and others held fast to keeping a strong CRA component in this legislation. The CRA has been critically important to many communities and community-based organizations in Connecticut and across the country. The CRA, like the Individual Development Accounts (IDAs) that I strongly support, helps more Americans to actively participate in our economy by providing them the ability to build assets and to access financial services. \\n   This legislation is not perfect. Its implementation will need to be monitored over time. I will be paying particular attention to how this legislation affects both consumer privacy and CRA implementation. However, this legislation is good and long overdue. It provides balanced and strong protections for consumers and communities without diluting its intended financial services benefits. \\n   Finally, I would like to thank those who have worked so tirelessly to do what so many others have tried and failed to do for the last 20 years. Through the hard work of the Senate Banking Committee members, including Senator DODD of Connecticut and Chairman GRAMM, their House counterparts, in conjunction with the Administration, particularly Secretary Summers and his staff, the financial services industry, and those representing the interests of consumers and communities, we now have legislation with compromise language that achieves a broad public purpose. We are now able to achieve the improvements to our financial services sector that have been needed for decades and that will effectively bring us into the next century. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19991103\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to present legislative background and history on a provision contained in the Manager\\'s Amendment to the African Growth and Opportunity Act adopted this evening by consent. Constituents in my state in the wool fabric industry have been concerned about any revision to tariff reduction and phase-out schedules that would unfairly alter their competitive posture and force layoffs of Connecticut employees. \\n   The final language in the provision states that, ``It is the sense of the Senate that U.S. trade policy should place a priority on the elimination or amelioration of tariff inversions that undermine the competitiveness of the U.S. consuming industries, while taking into account the conditions in the producing industry in the United States, especially those currently facing tariff phase-outs negotiated under prior trade agreements.\\'\\' I want to note that this provision as adopted was modified to reflect specific concerns I raised about it. While this provision merely expresses a ``sense of the Senate\\'\\' and is in no way law or binding, I do want to provide background on the intent of the provision. \\n   I note, first, that language in the provision as originally proposed directing the inclusion of the ``wool fabric\\'\\' industry sector in this provision was specifically deleted in the version that passed in the Manager\\'s Amendment, underscoring the Senate\\'s clear intent that this provision is not directed at this sector. \\n   Second, the provision specifically requires that full account be taken of ``conditions\\'\\' in the various ``producing industry in the United States,\\'\\' indicating that whatever further action Congress may want to consider in the future on this issue, or that the U.S. Trade Representative may raise in future negotiations, must assure fairness and equitable treatment to those currently producing in the United States. Furthermore, the language specifically states that special attention and equity is to be provided to ``those currently facing tariff phase-outs negotiated under prior trade agreements.\\'\\' Since my constituents in the wool fabrication sector specifically fall into exactly that posture, properly relying on phase-out schedules negotiated in prior trade agreements, this protection and assurance is directed at their concerns, which, in turn, is why their industry sector was dropped from application of this provision. \\n   I further appreciate the assurances provided me by the Managers of this bill that I will be provided full notice of any consideration of this issue in conference and that it will be resolved in a manner satisfactory to me in representation of my constituent\\'s concerns. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-2-19991103\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to explain my reasons for voting to table amendments No. 2379 and No. 2483 sponsored by Senator HOLLINGS. The two amendments would have required the United States to negotiate side agreements with the countries named in the African Growth and Opportunity Act and the United States-Caribbean Basin Trade Enhancement Act concerning labor standards and the environment similar to the North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation and the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation. Mandating that the United States negotiate agreements before providing the benefits granted to these countries under this act would have had the effect of nullifying the bill. \\n   Labor and environmental issues should be considered when negotiating trade agreements. In today\\'s global economy, the economic actions of one country can have profound implications for the entire world economy. We witnessed this firsthand with the recent global economic crisis. Just as the economic decisions of one person in Indonesia can have significant consequences for someone in Germany, the living standards, working conditions, and the environment standards of workers in Peru or Malaysia can have an impact on our workers here in the United States. \\n   The two amendments offered by Senator HOLLINGS have admirable goals, however they are unworkable in the context of this bill. Because this bill calls for the United States to take the unilateral action of reducing tariffs on a wide range of products in order to provide incentive for these countries to develop their economies, it would be out of place to mandate negotiations that were designed to accompany bilateral trade agreements. If we are serious about protecting workers and the environment, we should include them as part of a bilateral negotiation when our trading partners will have obligations to fulfill. \\n   Our goal with this bill is to improve and grow the economies of sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean Basin. We are doing this by opening our markets in the hope that these economies will integrate into the world economy as responsible trading partners and will develop as future markets for our exports. \\n   The two amendments offered by Senator HOLLINGS would have had the effect of neutralizing the underlying bill to support economic development in sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean Basin. I could support similar amendments when they are raised in the context of trade agreements when side agreements can be enforced. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19991029\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, it is with considerable glee that I rise today to commend a true titan of our national pastime, the New York Yankees, who earlier this week cemented their legacy as the preeminent dynasty of 20th century American sports. \\n   The Yankees four-game sweep of the Atlanta Braves in this year\\'s World Series earned the franchise its 25th championship of the 1900s, proving that the Yankees belong right up there with Uncle Sam and Mom\\'s apple pie as inspirational symbols of America\\'s greatness. \\n   In Connecticut, the loyalties of baseball fans are split between the Yankees, the New York Mets, and the Boston Red Sox. This made the 1999 Major League Baseball season truly memorable, as all three teams advanced to their respective league championships and vied for the pennant. \\n   I confess that I was once a Brooklyn Dodgers backer, but I have been cheering the Bronx Bombers for decades--since my eldest son, Matt, caught Yankee fever at an early age. Some of my fondest memories are watching games at Yankee Stadium with my family. Yet I cannot recall any of the teams\\' accomplishments being more impressive or fun to watch than this world championship, the Yankees\\' third in four years, capping a string of World Series triumphs that dates back to 1923. \\n   I tip my pinstripe cap to Manager Joe Torre, Series MVP Mariano Rivera, the indomitable Roger Clements, Orlando ``El Duque\\'\\' Hernandez, the valiant Paul O\\'Neill, the heroic Chad Curtis, and the entire Yankees organization for their inspirational and dominating play this October. The Yankees\\' remarkable success has brought untold joy to their neighbors in Connecticut. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19991026\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President. I am happy to join Senator GORTON in introducing a bill that we hope will restore some common sense to the way the country chooses party nominees for president. As Senator GORTON already has explained well, anyone taking a objective look at the current primary and caucus system could reach only one conclusion: it makes very little sense. \\n   Our primary system was meant to serve a very important purpose: to determine the two--or perhaps three--individuals who will have the opportunity to compete for the most powerful office in our nation, and perhaps in the world. Given the importance of the process, it is critical that it be a fair one, one that tests the mettle and the ideas of all of the candidates, one that allows the voters to hear and weigh the views of those seeking their parties\\' nominations, and one that gives the primary electorate--the whole, national primary electorate--a chance to choose the person they think will best represent them and their views in the ultimate contest to determine who will become President of the United States. \\n   But that just isn\\'t happening now. Instead of a system that tests a candidate\\'s character and his ability to offer reasoned opinions over the long haul, we have an increasingly compressed schedule, one in which States whose primaries once were spread out over months now compete to see who can hold their contests the earliest, and candidates compete to see who can raise more money than everyone else before the first primary voters ever step foot into the election booth. That ``money primary\\'\\' has already eliminated four of the Republican candidates for President. \\n   This is no way for the world\\'s greatest democracy to choose its leader. As Senator GORTON already has explained, the bill we are proposing today offers an alternative system, one that can restore the primary season to what it should be: a contest of candidates discussing their ideas for America\\'s future. By creating a series of regional primaries, we will make it more likely that all areas of the country have input into the nominee selection process, and that the candidates and their treasuries will not be stretched so thin by primaries all over the country on the same day. By spreading out the primaries over a four-month period, we have a chance to return to the days when the electorate had an opportunity to evaluate the candidates over time, and where voters--not just financial contributors--had decided who the parties\\' nominees will be. \\n   Anyone looking at the current system knows it has to change. I hope that we can make that happen before the 2004 campaign begins. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19991020\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Ten minutes is fine. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-2-19991020\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment offered by my colleague from Illinois, Senator DURBIN. The underlying bill and this amendment bring us back to these morally perplexing questions. We heard it in the sincerity of the speech by the Senator from Minnesota and the sincerity of all of my colleagues speaking on either side, for either of these approaches. \\n   This problem, more than any I have confronted in my public life, seems to me to join our personal value systems, our personal understanding about profound philosophical medical questions, such as ``When does life begin?\\'\\' with our role as legislators, with our role as lawmakers, with the limits of what our capacities are in making law and, ultimately, of course, also with what the reality is that the courts have stated as they have applied our Constitution, as the ultimate arbiter of our values and our rights in this country.  \\n   I support this proposal of Senator DURBIN\\'s because, once again, I think it actually will do what I believe most everybody--I would say everybody--in this Chamber would like the law to do, and that is to reduce the number of abortions that are performed. I support it also because I think it can be upheld as constitutional, and I sincerely and respectfully doubt the underlying proposal, the so-called Partial-Birth Abortion Act, will be upheld as constitutional. \\n   I remember I first dealt with these issues when I was a State senator in Connecticut in the 1970s, after the Roe v. Wade decision was first passed down by the Supreme Court, and the swelter of conflicting questions: What is the appropriate place for my convictions about abortion, my personal conviction that potential life begins at conception and, therefore, my personal conviction that all abortions are unacceptable? How do I relate that to my role as a lawmaker, to the limits of the law, to the right of privacy that the Supreme Court found in Roe v. Wade? \\n   This proposal that deals with partial-birth abortion, or intact dilation and extraction, brings us back once again to all of those questions. I have received letters from constituents in support of Senator SANTORUM\\'s proposal. I have had calls and conversations with constituents and friends--people I not only respect and trust but love--who have urged me to support Senator SANTORUM\\'s proposal. \\n   When you hear the description of this procedure, it is horrific; it is abominable. There is a temptation, of course, to want to respond and do what the underlying proposal asks us to do in the law by adopting this law. And then I come back to my own personal opinion, which is every abortion, no matter when performed during pregnancy--this is my personal view--is unacceptable and is, in its way, a termination of potential life. \\n   So as I step back and reach that conclusion, I have to place the proposal Senator SANTORUM puts before us and the one Senator DURBIN puts before us now in the context, one might say, of some humility of what the appropriate role for each of us is as lawmakers, what the appropriate role for this institution is as a lawmaking body, and what does the Court tell us is appropriate under the Constitution. I cannot reach any other conclusion, personally, than that Senator SANTORUM\\'s proposal is not constitutional, that Senator DURBIN\\'s is, and will, in fact, reduce the number of postviability abortions and, therefore, the number of abortions that are performed in our country. \\n   That is why I have added my name as a cosponsor to Senator DURBIN\\'S proposal. \\n   The courts have created well-defined boundaries for legislative action. Under Planned Parenthood versus Casey, the Supreme Court held that ``subsequent to viability, the State in promoting its interest in the potentiality of human life may, if it chooses, regulate, and even proscribe, abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.\\'\\' Partial birth legislation has been challenged 22 times in the courts resulting in 19 injunctions. The court-imposed constraints must be reflected in legislative efforts if we are going to achieve our goal of reducing late-term abortions. Enacting legislation that courts have struck down time and again is unlikely to reduce abortions. \\n   Most recently, of course, that conclusion was reached by the Eighth Circuit Court on September 24, little less than a month ago, when the court said:  \\n   Several states have enacted statutes seeking to ban ``partial-birth abortion.\\'\\' The precise wording of the statutes, and how far the statutes go in their attempts to regulate pre-viability abortions, differ from state to state. The results from constitutional challenges to the statutes, however, have been almost unvarying. In most of the cases that reached the federal courts, the courts have held the statutes unconstitutional.  \\n   So the constitutional impediment to the proposal Senator SANTORUM makes is that, notwithstanding the horrific nature of the so-called partial-birth abortion, the intact dilation and extraction method of abortion, you cannot prohibit by law, according to the Supreme Court of the United States, any particular form of terminating a pregnancy at all stages of the pregnancy. You can prohibit almost all forms of terminating a pregnancy after viability. That is what the Durbin amendment will do. \\n   Incidentally, viability as medical science has advanced, has become an earlier and earlier time in the pregnancy. \\n   There are exceptions. \\n   Incidentally, the language in the Durbin proposal is not full of loopholes. It is very strict and demanding. It requires a certification by a physician that the continuation of the pregnancy would threaten the mother\\'s life or risk grievous injury to her physical health. Those are serious requirements not meant to create a series of loopholes through which people intending to violate the law can go. \\n   As has been said, a new provision has been added to this amendment which requires that an independent physician who will not perform nor be present at the abortion, who was not previously involved in the treatment of the mother, can affirm the first physician\\'s opinion by a certification in writing. \\n   A physician who knowingly violates the act may be subject to suspension of license and penalties as high as $250,000. \\n   The limitations are specific. They are narrow. And they are, if I may say so, inflexible. In that sense, they respond in the most narrow way to the health exception required by the Supreme Court. \\n   This is such a good proposal which Senator DURBIN has offered that I hope we may come back to it at some other time when it is not seen by the proponents of Senator SANTORUM\\'s legislation as a negation of that legislation because this amendment in that sense never gets a fair vote or a clear vote. I think if we brought it up on its own, perhaps it could allow us the common ground on this difficult moral question toward which I think so many Members of the Chamber on both sides aspire. I hope we can find the occasion to do that. \\n   I thank the Chair. I thank my friend from Illinois for the work he has done in preparing this amendment and bringing it before us. \\n   I yield the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19991019\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a milestone vote by the distinguished senior Senator from Vermont. Today Senator PATRICK LEAHY becomes the 21st member in the Senate\\'s history to pass the 10,000 vote mark. I have had the opportunity to work alongside the Senator for the last 11 years and it gives me great pleasure to take a few minutes to discuss his many accomplishments. \\n   Senator LEAHY began working for the people of Vermont back in 1966, when he was elected Chittenden County state\\'s attorney. He quickly gained a national reputation when he revamped the office and led a national task force that was probing the 1973-74 energy crisis. In 1974, he was elected to the Senate and he remains the only Democratic Senator in the state\\'s history. This is important because to have the state of Vermont re-elect Senator LEAHY four times means that he is doing work here that appeals to a wide cross section of people. \\n   During his years as Chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, Senator LEAHY demonstrated his ability to report bills to the full Senate with strong bipartisan support. In partnership with Senator LUGAR he authored two farm bills that not only protected important nutrition initiatives like the WIC program, but also included landmark environmental features that have helped to preserve farmland. He has also been able to streamline the U.S. Department of Agriculture, in the process saving more than $2 billion. \\n   The issue that the Senator may be best known for is his fight for a world-wide ban on land mines. Since 1989 he has labored to raise awareness among the public and build political support within the administration. He pushed for an international treaty that would ban anti-personnel mines and got a commitment from the U.S. administration to sign the treaty when alternatives to the mines are available. And the Leahy War Victims Fund provides up to $12 million a year in medical supplies to aid land mine victims. \\n   Senator LEAHY is also a cofounder of the Congressional Internet Caucus. Now in his fifth term, Senator LEAHY remains on the cutting edge of technology as he was one of the first Senators to establish a home page on the web. He also conducts electronic town meetings with residents on-line, and has sought to update copyright law to reflect the changes that have occurred with the advent of the information age. \\n   Equally important as these legislative achievements is the sense of tradition that Senator LEAHY carries with him as he fulfills the daily tasks of a U.S. Senator. He has consistently been a voice for rural America, and, while he always votes with the people of Vermont in mind, in a more traditional way PATRICK LEAHY has not been afraid to take an unpopular stance if he believes that the national interest is at stake. He is a Statesman who appeals to a sense of bipartisanship on issues dealing with our national security and foreign policy. These are customs that are essential to the success of this institution, and the Senator is often looked to for leadership for these reasons. \\n   I congratulate Senator LEAHY for this momentous achievement. He is a fine example of what a United States Senator should be. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19991019\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, in her most recent book, ``The Corruption of American Politics,\\'\\' the very skilled and veteran Washington reporter Elizabeth Drew writes that ``indisputably, the greatest change in Washington over the past 25 years--in its culture, in the way it does business and the ever-burgeoning amount of business transactions that go on here--has been in the preoccupation with money. It has transformed politics and its has subverted values .....\\'\\' \\n   This evaluation once was nursed by a few public interest groups and then a group of congressional reformers. Now, it constitutes conventional wisdom. It is written in the books. It is fact. The political preoccupation with money has ``transformed us and subverted values.\\'\\' According to a Quinnipiac College poll published October 14, 68 percent of those surveyed believe large campaign contributions influence the policies supported by elected officials and a June survey by the National Academy of Public Administration reported the number one thing politicians could do to regain public trust is to curb large campaign contributions. Despite these assessments from the people we serve, Congress remains incapable of changing how U.S. federal campaigns are financed. \\n   With the 2000 election cycle well underway, it is clear the worst habits of the past two decades have become the springboard from which new excesses will be launched. Candidates are awash in more money than ever before and party fund-raising records are being shattered again and again. At least two presidential primary candidates--George W. Bush and Steve Forbes--have decided to forego public matching funds in order to avoid the related limits on their campaign spending, while candidates and third party groups are seeking ever more inventive ways to raise undisclosed and unlimited funds to communicate with voters and influence elections. \\n   As a member of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, I had hoped the system had reached its nadir in the 1996 federal election campaign, which the committee investigated for most of 1997. I was too optimistic. Because of Congress\\' failure to enact campaign finance \\n   reform, the system continues to fester and elections seem to be auctioned off to the highest bidders. \\n   After it\\'s over, the complete story of the 200 presidential race will be told. Until then, the investigation conducted by the Governmental Affairs Committee provides the best portrait there is of how corrupt our elections have become and how obviously current practices violate the clear intent of Congress in passing campaign finance laws. Our investigation revealed that in 1996, the major parties sabotaged some of the most fundamental values underpinning our American experiment in self-rule. They gave millions of Americans good reason to doubt whether they had a true and equal voice in their own government. \\n   What emerged from that investigation was the picture of a campaign finance system gone haywire--a story replete with abuses ranging from institutionalized failures to two-bit hustlers--a story that should have made any elected federal official ashamed and disgusted by the taint that has diminished our representative democracy, that is to say, every citizen\\'s right to an equal voice in his or her government. The investigation forces us to ask whether we are no longer a nation where one person\\'s vote speaks louder than another person\\'s money. Or have we reached a place where one person\\'s money can drown out another person\\'s vote? \\n   For those who may have forgotten the unseemly details, let me remind you of what our year-long investigation uncovered, because it\\'s important to remember these things. We learned about a brazen man named Roger Tamraz, who contributed $300,000 in soft money to the Democratic Party for access to the White House in order  to try to override the NSC\\'s rejection of his plan for a Caspian Sea oil pipeline. Ultimately, he never gained the White House support he was looking for but he did get to talk to the President of the United States. Any lessons to be learned from his experience, we asked? Yes, he responded. Next time he would contribute $600,000. After this remarkable comment, Tamraz admitted he had never even bothered to register to vote because, in his words, his checkbook was worth ``a bit more than a vote.\\'\\' \\n   We also learned about Johnny Chung, a California entrepreneur, who visited the White House 49 times, had lots of pictures taken with the President, and once gave the First Lady\\'s chief of staff a $50,000 check right there in the East Wing. He had a particularly jarring assessment of our government. ``I see the White House is like a subway,\\'\\' he told the committee. ``You have to put in coins to open the gates.\\'\\' \\n   For those of you who may think these are just marginal opportunists who slipped through the cracks of our system, let me remind you of the revolving cast of top-dollar contributors who slept in the Lincoln bedroom and of the chairman of the Republican Party who sought a $2.1 million loan for a Republican think tank from a Hong Kong industrialist, which was intentionally \\n   defaulted on 2 years later. The chairman said he had no idea this was a foreign contribution, even though the industrialist had renounced his U.S. citizenship and the chairman obtained the loan while cruising Hong Kong Harbor on the industrialist\\'s luxury yacht. \\n   These are colorful stories and among the most outrageous incidents uncovered by the committee. But the far more prevalent collection of big soft money donations came not from the carnival hawkers but from mainstream corporate and union interests and individuals. In total, the parties raised $262 million in soft money during the 1996 campaigns--12 times the amount they raised in 1984. And that\\'s chicken feed compared to the amount of soft money being raised for the 2000 campaign. Based on the first 6 months of this year, both parties have doubled their take over the same period in 1995. \\n   To my friends who say these contributions are an expression of free and protected speech, I respectfully disagree. Free speech is abut the inalienable right to express our views without government interference. It is about the vision the Framers of our Constitution enshrined--a vision that ensures that we will never compromise our American birthright to offer opinions, even when those opinions are unpopular or repugnant. But that is not at issue here, Mr. President. Absolutely nothing in this campaign finance bill will diminish or threaten any American\\'s right to express his or her views about candidates running for office or about any other issue in American life. \\n   What we would be threatening, is something entirely different, and that is the ever increasing and disproportionate power that those with money have over our political system. Let\\'s not fool ourselves--because the American public isn\\'t fooled. Much of the campaign money raised comes from people seeking to maintain their access to, and perhaps sway over, particular parties or candidates. That explains why so many big givers are so generous with both parties at the same time. \\n   Everyone of us in this chamber knows intimately the cost of running for office. It requires us to spend so much more time raising money than we ever did in the past, so much more time that we find we have less time to do the things that led us to run for office in the first place. Barely a day seems to go by in this town in which there is not an event or a meeting with elected officials attended only by those who can afford sums of money that are beyond the capacity of the overwhelming majority of Americans to give. That, Mr. President, is threatening the principle that I--and all of us, I dare say--hold just as dearly as the principle of free speech. It is the genius of our Republic, the principle that promises one man, one vote, that every person--rich or poor, man or woman, white or black, Christian or Jew, Muslim or Hindu--has an equal right and an equal ability to influence the workings of their government. \\n   I have always said the most serious transgressions of the 1996 presidential campaign were legal. Wealthy donors contributing hundreds of thousands of dollars in soft money blatantly skirted legal limits on individual contributions. Unions and corporations donate millions to both Republican and Democratic parties, despite decades-old prohibitions on union and corporate involvement in federal campaigns. And tax-exempt groups paid for millions of dollars worth of television ads that clearly endorsed or attacked particular candidates even though the groups were barred by law from engaging in such extensive partisan electoral activity. Each of these acts compromised the integrity of our elections and our government. Each of these acts violated the spirit of our laws. \\n   To achieve significant reform of the Federal Election Campaign Act, the unrelenting pressure to raise vast sums of money simply must be reduced. A ban on soft money contributions is the necessary beginning to that process and the current McCain-Feingold proposal is the vehicle through which this goal can best be accomplished now. I believe the record created by the Governmental Affairs Committee\\'s hearing in 1997 helped that bill obtain the votes of a majority of the Senate in the 105th Congress, but an anti-reform minority filibustered the bill and prevented it from passing. The House has twice approved the companion Shays-Meehan proposal. A majority of Congress supports this bill. A large majority of the American public supports this bill. One day, if not today, it will become law. By placing a limit on the amount of money raised for campaigns, we can restore a sense of integrity--and of sanity--to our campaign financing system and to our democracy. \\n   If I could waive a magic wand, I would have Congress enact far broader reforms than what is in the bill before us today. I would make sure that advertisements for candidates could no longer masquerade as so-called issue ads, thereby evading the disclosure requirements of our campaign laws; I would make sure that no organization could claim the benefit of tax-exemption and then work to influence the election or defeat of particular candidates or parties. I would make sure that candidates for the Presidency who receive public funds live up to the original intent of the law, that they remain above the fund-raising fray and abstain from raising any more money once they have accepted public funds. I would like to see more exacting criminal law provisions become part of the campaign finance law. Indeed, I hope to offer and support amendments aimed at some of these problems as our debate on this bill continues. \\n   The truth is that we can never fully write into law what every citizen has a right to expect from his or her representatives--that those who seek to write the rules for the nation will respect them, rather than search high and low for ways to evade their requirements and eviscerate their intent; and that those who have sworn to abide by the Constitution will honor the trust and responsibilities the Constitution places in their hands. \\n   We can, however, reduce the feverish and incessant chase for money, the chase that has pushed candidates and their parties to duck, dodge and ultimately debase the laws we have now. The pressure to raise ever expanding sums of cash will continue to drive good people to do bad things, almost regardless of what the law calls for, if we do not recast the system to permanently defuse the fund-raising arms race and stem the corrosive influence of big money. That is the challenge ahead of us. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19991019\\n\\n    Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the Cheshire Lions Club of Cheshire, CT which is celebrating its 50th anniversary of service to the community.  \\n   With the support of area residents, the Cheshire Lions Club has reached out to assist many members of the community. The Lions Club has developed a national reputation for advancing such worthwhile local causes as the D.A.R.E. Program for schools, academic scholarships for local students, and area food banks, and the Cheshire club has been an important part of that legacy. Over the years, members of the Cheshire Lions Club have actively involved themselves in countless civic activities and made a real difference in Connecticut. Their hard work has reached far beyond the Town of Cheshire and the Lions Club stands tall as an example of the principles upon which our nation was built. \\n   As the Cheshire Lions Club has grown, its numerous good works have touched many lives and demonstrated the true value of community spirit. I ask that my colleagues join me in thanking the club and all its members for their service, dedication, and contributions to our state.  \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19991019\\n\\n    Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Central Connecticut State University as it celebrates its 150th anniversary. Under the dynamic leadership of President Richard Judd, this fine institution has continued to achieve the vision of academic excellence upon which it was founded. \\n   Originally the New Britain Normal School, CCSU was established by the State General Assembly in 1849 and stands as the oldest public institution of higher education in Connecticut. Whether under the name Normal School, Teachers College of Connecticut, or Central Connecticut State University, its students have never received less than a first-rate education. CCSU has cultivated a rich academic environment in which both graduates and undergraduates have the opportunity to better understand themselves as well as the world around them. \\n   Academically, athletically, and culturally, CCSU and its more than 11,000 students have much to celebrate throughout this special year. What makes CCSU so unique is that it has never isolated itself from the surrounding community. Instead, the university embraces its position within the larger civic arena and, in doing so, offers its students the valuable opportunity to make a real difference in the city of New Britain and beyond. CCSU students, faculty, and facilities have played a significant role in the city\\'s development and will continue to weave themselves into the city\\'s social fabric for many years to come. \\n   Mr. President, I ask that my colleagues join me in celebrating the sesquicentennial anniversary of Central Connecticut State University, one of the Nation\\'s great academic institutions.  \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19991019\\n\\n    Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the Societa Regionale Marchegiana of New Haven, CT, as they celebrate their 90th anniversary of service to the Greater New Haven community. Founded in 1909 on the principles of brotherhood and community involvement, the Marchegiana Society has enjoyed 90 years of success as one of the State\\'s largest fraternal organizations. \\n   A number of important events have marked the history of the Regional Marchegiana Society, including the construction of the Marchegian Center and the merging with its sister group, the Ladies Marchegiana Society. In times of war and in times of peace, this proud organization has always served as a model of patriotism, dedication, and community spirit. Over the years, its members have actively involved themselves in countless civic activities and made a real difference to the city of New Haven. In our society, which draws its strength from its diversity, the Marchegiana Society stands tall as an example of the principles upon which our nation was built. \\n   Mr. President, I ask that you join me in honoring the fine men and women of the Regional Marchegiana Society. They have met and exceeded the expectations of their 36 founders and will undoubtedly continue their unblemished record of service far into the future.  \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19991013\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep disappointment with the agriculture conference report that we in the Senate will vote on today. This agriculture appropriations bill falls well short of helping the Connecticut farmers whose very livelihood was badly hurt by this summer\\'s record drought, and who are depending on our assistance to recover from the devastating losses they have suffered. Instead, this plan simply leaves farmers throughout the Northeast even higher and drier, and leaves me no choice but to vote against this bill. \\n   In August, I joined with Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman in visiting a family farm in Northford to inspect the drought damage done in Connecticut this year. On that day, the Secretary declared the entire state a drought disaster area. Since then, it has been estimated that farmers in our state have incurred losses of $41 million; together, the 13 Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states estimate their losses at $2.5 billion. \\n   Sadly, despite strong bipartisan pleas for support, the agriculture appropriations bill shortchanges our state as well as the entire Northeast region. Of the $8.7 billion in ``emergency\\'\\' farm relief this bill provides, only $1.2 billion is available for natural disaster aid. This smaller allocation of money must be distributed, in turn, to farmers nationwide for drought, flood, and other natural disaster damage. It is likely that the drought-stricken farmers of the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states would receive only about $300 million--less than one-eighth of their estimated recovery costs. \\n   Historically, hard working Connecticut farmers benefit from very little federal assistance. During the last fiscal year, for example, Connecticut farmers received less than one-tenth of one percent of the $10.6 billion paid out by the government-funded Commodity Credit Corporation. It is only fair that when they need emergency recovery assistance, the government come through for Connecticut farmers too. Sadly, this bill is not fair. \\n   This agriculture spending plan is regionally inequitable, offers insufficient disaster assistance for Connecticut farmers, and represents unacceptable public policy. In times of legitimate farm crises, Congress has repeatedly provided a helping hand to farmers in the Midwest and South. We owe nothing less to the farmers in Connecticut and throughout the Northeast who make a critical contribution to our economy. They deserve real help, not a bill of goods. \\n   I am also concerned by the disappearance during conference of the Northeast Dairy Compact, which had been approved by the House of Representatives. Because the usual conference committee proceedings were circumvented this year, it is impossible to know why the Dairy Compact is missing in action. Regardless of the answer to this question, the subversion of the conference committee process disturbs me and represents a bad precedent for our legislative process. \\n   Because this bill does not provide real, equitable relief for Connecticut farmers and does not include reauthorization of the Northeast Dairy Compact, I will join my colleagues from the Northeast in voting against it. I thank the chair, and I yield the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19991013\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, the good-faith efforts of people on both sides of the aisle to avoid a vote, knowing that there were not votes in the Senate to ratify this treaty, have obviously failed. The vote will occur soon, and the votes are not there to ratify the treaty. That, in my opinion, is profoundly unfortunate. There is plenty of blame to be passed all around for that result. \\n   I think at this moment we all should not look backward but look forward, and particularly say to our friends and allies and enemies around the world that this vote tonight does not send a signal that the majority of the American people and their Representatives in Congress and in the Senate are not profoundly concerned about nuclear proliferation and are not interested in arriving at a treaty that genuinely will protect future generations from that threat. \\n   At times in this debate I was heartened by statements, including those made by the current occupant of the Chair, the Senator from Nebraska, saying if the vote occurred, you would vote against the ratification tonight, but more work ought to be done and more thought ought to be given. I hope in the days ahead we will be able to reach across the partisan aisle, work together without time limitation or even timeframe, to see if we can find a way to build adequate support for the ratification of this treaty, or a treaty which will control the proliferation of nuclear weapons by prohibiting the testing of those weapons. I invite my colleagues from both parties to join with us in that effort in working together with our administration. I hope we can take from this experience the lessons of what we did not do this time and should do next time. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19991012\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Delaware. \\n   As I have listened to my colleagues during this debate, I feel as if the Senate has backed itself at least into a procedural corner in the midst of a policy disagreement. \\n   This is not the first time this has happened in the history of the Senate--not even in the 10 1/2 years I have been here. But this is one of the most consequential times we have done so. For it seems to be a combination of reasons that are part ideological, part partisan, and part just plain personal. I hope we can find a way to work ourselves out of this corner because the stakes here are high. \\n   As the debate has been going on, I have been thinking about the two big debates that have occurred here in the decade that I have been privileged to serve in this body. One was the gulf war debate and the other was the Middle East peace accords, the Oslo accords. \\n   I think of the gulf war debate because I remember as President Bush dispatched a half million troops to the gulf that I was dismayed at how the reaction to that act by President Bush was dividing along partisan lines. It didn\\'t seem like a partisan question to me. People could have good faith opinions on both sides, but the opinions were not based on party affiliation. \\n   I have the same feeling as I listen to this debate, and watch the lines harden. Something unusual and unsettling has happened to our politics when party lines divide us so clearly and totally on a matter of national security. That is not the way it used to be in the Senate. And that is not the way it ought to be. \\n   The same is true of the procedural dilemma to which we have come. We have a President--and those of us who support this treaty--acknowledging that the votes are not there to ratify it now. That says that the opponents of the treaty have won for now. \\n   So why push for the vote? If the President of the United States has asked that it be delayed because of his fear of the consequences of a vote failing to ratify on nuclear proliferation, this is not political. This goes to the heart of our security and the hopes and fears we have for our future and our children\\'s future. \\n   But I will say if there is one thing, in my opinion, that would be worse than going ahead and voting, even though we know those who oppose ratification of the treaty have won. That would be for us as a majority to voluntarily say that we will prohibit the President or ourselves from raising the question of this critical and progressive treaty again for the next year and a half. I think to do that would send an even worse signal to India, to Pakistan, to China, and to Russia. \\n   Let\\'s keep the hope of a more secure world alive. Let\\'s acknowledge that we have a common goal. \\n   Is anybody for nuclear proliferation? Don\\'t we all agree that the atmosphere  is cleaner and the likelihood of nuclear proliferation less if nations can\\'t test? Can\\'t we find a way across party lines to do what we have done with other treaties--to adopt reservations or safeguards or conditions which allow enough of us to come together to ratify this treaty? Why are we heading toward a wall from which there will be no good return and no good result? \\n   I have also been thinking of the Middle East peace accords and the Oslo accords because I remember what Prime Minister Rabin said. \\n   If you are strong you can take risks for peace.  \\n   We are the strongest nation today in the history of the world. When it comes to strategic nuclear weapons, we are dominant. We have more than 6,000. If, tragically, for whatever reason, a few of them don\\'t work we have such--in the marvelous term of the Pentagon--``redundancy\\'\\' that we have thousands of others that we can rely on in the dreadful occasion that we might need to use them. \\n   This treaty promises to freeze our advantage in nuclear weapons. Since we are the strongest nation in history and this treaty may well make us more dominant in the crucial, terrible arena of nuclear weapons, why would we not want to take the risk of ratifying this treaty? It is, in my opinion, a very small risk for increasing peace and security for all--for our children, for our grandchildren. If we decide that testing is once again required by the United States in pursuit of our national interests, that option is protected. The treaty language is very clear: We can--and I am sure we will--withdraw. \\n   My appeal in closing is to say, Can\\'t we find a way to come back to some sense of common purpose and shared vision of a future? Both sides have said on the floor that nuclear proliferation is one of the great threats to our future. We are hurtling down a path, as this dreadful power spreads to other countries of the world, many of them rogue nations, where we cannot rely on the bizarre system of mutual assured destruction that saved the United States from nuclear war during the cold war. If an accident becomes more likely, the consequences will be dreadful. Can\\'t we find a way to avoid good old-fashioned gridlock, which is survivable on most occasions in this Senate, but I think potentially devastating on this occasion? \\n   I appeal to my colleagues on the other side, whether there is or is not a vote now on this treaty, let\\'s get together and figure a way we can sit, study the matter, talk to people in the Pentagon and people in allied countries, and see if we cannot find a way to agree on enough reservations, safeguards, and conditions to come back, hopefully next year, and ratify this treaty. \\n   I yield the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19991001\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19991001\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, last evening after the final vote occurred, my friend and colleague from Kansas, Senator BROWNBACK, took the floor and offered an amendment which he then withdrew. I was not able, because of my personal schedule, to be here at that time. But as an original sponsor of the original legislation offered by Senator BROWNBACK, which would have created a special committee on cultural matters, I did want to simply say a few words about this. \\n   I know this became controversial within the Senate, but I felt from the beginning that Senator BROWNBACK\\'s intentions were not only worthy but they were relevant; that the cultural problems which the committee, or later the task force, would have addressed are real, as every family in America knows when their children turn on the television or go to a movie or listen to a CD or play a video game. \\n   The problems are not only real, but they are actually relevant to so many of the matters we more formally discuss on the floor of the Senate--such as the solitary explosions, violent criminal behavior, problems such as teenage pregnancies, I think all of which are affected by the messages our culture gives our children and, indeed, adults about behavior. Of course, I am talking about the hypersexual content, hyperviolent content in too much of our culture. \\n   In this case, this effort by Senator BROWNBACK, with the withdrawal of the amendment last night, was not to culminate successfully. But the battle will go on. \\n   Clearly, the standing committees of the Senate will--I certainly hope they will; I am confident they will--continue to pursue cultural questions because they are so important, they are so central to the moral condition and future of our country. I look forward to working on those with Senator BROWNBACK and other colleagues as we go forward. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19991001\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I note there is a rule in the Senate against using props. I, just for a moment, ask unanimous consent for a transitional prop, if I might briefly hold this up. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-2-19991001\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. \\n   This is my favorite ESPN parka. It gives you an indication of about what I am going to speak. It is in some sense as cultural as the first part of my comments. It does involve the influence of television on the American culture. But today, in this part of it, the news is good and the occasion is one to celebrate, particularly for those who may find some meaning in words that might confuse visitors from another planet, such as ``en fuego\\'\\' or ``boo-yaah.\\'\\' Twenty years ago, a small cable television enterprise, tucked away in the woods of central Connecticut, introduced itself to America with these words:  \\n   If you\\'re a fan, what you\\'ll see in the minutes, hours and days to follow may convince you that you\\'ve gone to sports heaven.  \\n   True to that prophecy, the past 20 years have marked our national elevation into another world of sublime sports saturation. \\n   In recognition of its outstanding contribution in shaping the sports entertainment industry, I wish to speak today--and I believe I speak for all of my colleagues, at least a great majority--in offering our kudos to an American sports institution and the pride of Bristol, CT--the ESPN Network which turned 20 years old last month, on September 7. The folks at ESPN aired an anniversary special that night duly celebrating the network\\'s unique constructive contribution to our culture, and yesterday there was a congressional reception in honor of that anniversary. \\n   Those of us who attended not only had the chance to toast ESPN but to meet an extraordinary group of American heroes: boxing legend Muhammad Ali, football great Johnny Unitas, and Olympian Carl Lewis. \\n   So I take the floor to pay tribute to one of my favorite corporate constituents, and I think one of America\\'s favorite networks. \\n   The story of how ESPN came to be is really an American rags to riches classic, and that network\\'s unbreakable bond with the \\n   small Connecticut city of its founding is part of that story. \\n   Bristol, CT, population 63,000, is a wonderful town, 20 minutes west of Hartford. Most famous previously for being the cradle of clockmaking during the industrial age, Bristol seemed an unlikely candidate to emerge as the cradle of electronics sports media, but it did. Believe it or not, ESPN probably would not exist today--certainly not in Bristol--if the old New England Whalers of the World Hockey Association had not had a disappointing season in 1978. \\n   The Whalers\\' public relations director, a man named Bill Rasmussen, one of several employees to lose his job in a front-office shakeup at the end of that season, decided he had an idea he wanted to try. He was a Whalers man at heart, and he figured he could stay involved with his team by starting a new cable television channel that would broadcast Whalers games statewide. He even had a second-tier dream of someday possibly broadcasting University of Connecticut athletics statewide as well. \\n   Rasmussen rented office space in Plainville, CT, near Bristol, and thought up the name Entertainment and Sports Programming Network, or ESPN. But before he had even unpacked in Plainville, he ran into his first problem--the town had an ordinance which prohibited satellite dishes. Undeterred, Rasmussen scrambled to nearby Bristol, found a parcel of land in an industrial park in the outskirts of the city, which he promptly bought, sight unseen, I gather, for $18,000. The rest, as they say, is history. \\n   Today, ESPN, from this same location, generates $1.3 billion a year in revenues and is seen in more than 75 million American homes. \\n   ESPN realized that second-tier dream that Rasmussen had. Earlier this year, his station provided exhaustive coverage of UConn athletics when the Huskies won the NCAA men\\'s basketball championship--only the game was not broadcast statewide; it was broadcast worldwide.  \\n   Twenty years after its founding, ESPN commands an international audience that watches every sport--from baseball to badminton to Australian rules football. The network\\'s flagship, SportsCenter, is currently the longest running program on cable television, with more than 21,000 episodes logged--truly, the Cal Ripken of network television. \\n   In a measure of its enormous influence on our culture, the catch phrases coined by SportsCenter\\'s quick-witted anchors routinely find their way into the American vocabulary, such as the aforementioned ``en fuego\\'\\' and ``boo-yaah.\\'\\' \\n   The program also has broadened sports appeal by peppering broadcasts with references to literature, history, and other high-minded fields not always connected with sporting events. The father of this breed of broadcasting, of course, is Chris Berman, probably my most famous constituent. He was hired from a Waterbury, CT, radio station at the age 24 to become one of ESPN\\'s pioneering voices. What a great professional and source of great joy Chris Berman is. \\n   A testament to his place among sportscasting greats can be heard across ballparks in America each time a home run ball is struck. If you listen closely, as the ball nears the fence, you may think that the ballfield is being overtaken by a herd of chickens clucking: ``Back, back\\'\\'--I am restraining myself here on the floor, Mr. President, but you get the idea--``back, back, back, back, back,\\'\\' in homage to the Swami\\'s classic call. Berman is also the father of the modern sports nickname, concocting such classics as: Burt ``Be Home\\'\\' Blyleven, John ``I Am Not A\\'\\' Kruk, and Roberto ``Remember The\\'\\' Alomar. There are certain individuals unnamed in the Democratic Cloakroom who have attempted to emulate this style of nicknaming for sports figures, and they are not doing badly. Oh, and lest we forget another household name, ESPN introduced us to the man who genuinely put the ``Madness\\'\\' into March Madness--the nattering nabob of Naismith, the great Dick Vitale. \\n   So thanks to Chris Berman, to Dick Vitale, and to all the others who have made ESPN part of our lives. \\n   ESPN is today to sports what Walter Cronkite once was to politics and public affairs--the authoritative voice fans turn to when a major story breaks. As political columnist George Will once wisely said: ``If someone surreptitiously took everything but ESPN from my cable television package, it might be months before I noticed.\\'\\' \\n   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 3 more minutes. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-3-19991001\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Despite ESPN\\'s national prominence and its countless opportunities to relocate to a larger media market, the network has steadfastly stayed with bucolic Bristol, as it is endearingly referred to on the air. ESPN maintains its foothold in the same industrial park where it began 20 years ago, although the Bristol campus, as it is now called, spans today 43 acres and the network has 210 employees. We in Connecticut are very proud of this relationship and particularly of ESPN\\'s leaders and broadcasters who have happily put down roots and raised their families in central Connecticut. \\n   I think John Leone, former mayor of Bristol, now head of the Bristol Chamber of Commerce, may have summed up the relationship between the city and its network best when he said:  \\n   In New York, ESPN would be just another network. Here in Bristol, ESPN is the king.  \\n   So to the king of Bristol--and their royalty of American sports television--I say happy 20th, ESPN, and many more. \\n   Before I yield the floor, I want to give a special thank you to Eric Kleiman of my office staff who truly inspired this statement of gratitude and tribute to a great television network. \\n   I thank the Chair and suggest the absence of a quorum. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19991001\\n\\n    Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to recognize a milestone in the extraordinary life of one of America\\'s most distinguished statesmen, former President Jimmy Carter, who celebrates his 75th birthday today. \\n   Twenty-three years ago, in the turbulent aftermath of Watergate, Americans yearned for a leader of honesty and integrity who would steward the country into an uncertain future. We found that man in James Earl Carter, Jr., a submariner and farmer-turned-Georgia-Governor who we elected our 39th President. \\n   President Carter served very honorably and ably during his term in office, earning distinction for diplomatic successes such as overseeing in the signing of the Panama Canal Treaty and the Camp David Accords. And in his 19 years since leaving office, President Carter has demonstrated himself to be one of the world\\'s great humanitarians. \\n   In 1982, he founded the Carter Center--a nonprofit, nonpartisan center dedicated to promoting democracy, human rights, and conflict-resolution throughout the world. The center\\'s work has been remarkable. In the past two decades--whether fighting to eradicate Guinea worm disease, thwarting conflict in Haiti, or helping to free political prisoners across the globe--President Carter has carved out a deserved reputation as one of the most active, humane, and accomplished ex-Presidents in American history. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990929\\n\\n    Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senators BROWNBACK, KERRY, and others in introducing this important legislation today. America is a deeply religious nation, and fostering a society in which all Americans can worship according to the dictates of their conscience has been of prominent importance to this country since its beginning. Indeed, the Founders of this great Nation saw preserving Americans\\' ability to worship freely as so important that they enshrined it in the Bill of Rights\\' very first amendment. \\n   Unfortunately, a number of Americans today are not able to take full advantage of America\\'s promise of religious freedom. They are instead being forced to make a choice no American should face: one between the dictates of their faith and the demands of their job. Whether by being forced to work on days their religion requires them to refrain from work or by being denied the right to wear clothing their faith mandates they wear, too many Americans of faith are facing an unfair choice between their job and their religion. \\n   This legislation would provide much needed help for those confronted with that choice. It would require employers to provide reasonable accommodations to an employee\\'s religious observance or practice, unless doing so would impose an undue hardship on the employer. The bill would not, it is worth emphasizing, give employees a right to dictate the conditions of their job, because it does not demand that employers accede to unreasonable requests. Instead, it requires only that an employer grant a religiously based request for an accommodation to an employee\\'s religious belief or practice if the accommodation would not impose significant difficulty or expense on the employer. \\n   Mr. President, this legislation is long overdue. I hope that we can see it enacted into law soon.  \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990929\\n\\n    Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that my esteemed colleagues and I bring to the Senate\\'s attention for the eighth time in 18 years the plight of Iran\\'s Baha\\'is by submitting today the Baha\\'i Resolution of 1999. \\n   Since the 1997 election of President Mohammad Khatami, the world has watched Iran with great anticipation of change. Indeed, under Khatami, Iran has witnessed some small, incremental steps toward democratization, transparency, and an attempt to assert the rule of law. As recent demonstrations at Tehran University have shown, the Iranian people are eager for reform, the kinds of changes that would allow Iran to become a member in good standing of the international community. \\n   The Iranian people have suffered much in the last 20 years. A regime desperate to maintain control at all costs has executed hundreds of thousands of Iranians of all religious and political backgrounds. Iran\\'s economy is in shambles, many of its best and brightest have fled, and the government\\'s pursuit of policies supporting terrorism and the development of weapons of mass destruction have made Iran a pariah state in the international community. It is good to remember, as we focus on the plight of specific groups in Iran, that all of Iran\\'s citizens, Shi\\'a, Sunni, Zoroastrian, Jewish, Christian, and Baha\\'i, have been victimized by the Iranian regime. \\n   However, today we focus on the group that, man for man and woman for woman, has fared the worst under Iran\\'s revolutionary government--the Baha\\'is. \\n   Since the Islamic Revolution and consequent seizure of power by the Ayatollah Khomeni, the Baha\\'is have endured tremendous hardships that continue to this day. Large numbers have been killed and many other have disappeared and are presumed dead. Unlike other religious minorities in Iran such as Christians, Jews and Zoroastrians, the Baha\\'is are not recognized in the Iranian Constitution and subsequently do not enjoy the rights, minimal though they may be, normally granted Iranian citizens. \\n   The refusal of Iran to protect the rights of the Baha\\'i community is ironic. The Baha\\'is do not advocate insurrection, violence, or political partisanship. Their faith requires them peacefully to observe the laws of the country. For the Iranian government to regard the Baha\\'is as a threat, when all they desire is to be able to live in accordance with their religious beliefs is truly outrageous. \\n   Now, imagine if you will what it would be like to live in a world where you and your children are not recognized as citizens simply because of your religion. Imagine your government seizing your only outlet for a higher education. Imagine fearing arrest simply for adhering to a set of beliefs and a way of life that you and your family hold dear. Unfortunately, this nightmarish scenario is all too real for 300,000 members of the Baha\\'i religion in Iran who need not expend any effort imagining such a situation, because they have the misfortune of living it. \\n   Even after their signing of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the recent election of President Khatami, the Iranian government still shows no sign of easing its subjugation of Iran\\'s largest religious minority. Tehran continues to oppress, persecute, and undermine the Baha\\'i\\'s way of life. Under such pressure, we fear that an already tragic past can only lead to a bleaker future. \\n   Since 1979 the Baha\\'i community has been denied the right to assemble officially, conduct religious ceremonies--including the proper burial of their dead--and attend Iranian schools of higher education. Baha\\'is are denied the same job and pension opportunities as their non-Baha\\'i neighbors and by law. They cannot even collect on insurance policies. \\n   The denial of access to schools of higher education has been a particular hardship to the Baha\\'is, who hold as one of the central tenets of their faith the supreme importance of education. In order to educate their youth, the Baha\\'is have created a network of university level courses, accredited by the University of Indiana and taught in the homes of Baha\\'i professors. Over 900 Baha\\'is have enrolled in the Open University and many more have benefited from their programs. In the Fall of 1998, for no other reason than to harass the Baha\\'i community, Iranian police raided over 500 homes associated with the Open University. Police arrested hundreds of professors and seized massive amounts of classroom and laboratory equipment, computers, and textbooks. To this day, three professors remain in jail. One has been sentenced to a ten year imprisonment and two have received seven year terms all for the `sin\\' of involving themselves in teaching Baha\\'i studies which, according to the Iranian authorities constituted ``crimes against national security.\\'\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990923\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, America is experiencing one of its most prosperous times, yet despite a booming national economy some 5.3 million families are spending more than half of their income on housing or are living in severely substandard housing. In Hartford, Connecticut alone, there are 19,000 families suffering in worst case housing. \\n   Most distressing, more than one million elderly and over two million families with children face an affordable housing crisis. \\n   Recent data indicate that this trend is worsening as housing costs rise faster than the incomes of low-income working families, and the number of affordable public housing units drops. In fact, more than 2 million public housing units were lost between 1973 and 1995, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development indicates that as many as 1,000 more units are being lost each month. \\n   As a result, more than one million Americans languish on waiting lists for public housing or Section 8 vouchers. In Connecticut, the average time for waiting lists for public housing is 14 months and Section 8 vouchers is 41 months. \\n   Last year, Congress passed a significant measure to streamline many public housing programs and focus more resources on families most in need of assistance. This included almost 100,000 new Section 8 vouchers. Tragically, the bill before us today provides no funding for these vouchers. In light of the tremendous need, and the gap that has grown in housing assistance over the past few years, providing fund for these new rental assistance vouchers is a modest, but crucial step.  \\n   These vouchers are not a free ride--families still must pay at least 30 percent of their incomes for rent. Without the vouchers, however, millions of working families and elderly citizens will be unable to secure affordable housing. \\n   Mr. President, I\\'d like to take a few additional moments to address another program of great importance. Under the leadership of Secretary Cuomo, the Department of Housing and Urban Development has made great strides to create a new, innovative approach to government through the Community Builders Program. \\n   Unfortunately, this appropriations bill would kill this initiative by terminating the 400 Community Builder fellows hired to serve in field offices around the country. This program is the first agency-run program in the Federal Government for experienced local professionals to perform short-term, public service in their communities. It represents a new way of thinking about government service and creates an opportunity to tap well-qualified talent in the community. \\n   Under the program, HUD recruits, hires and trains professional individuals--who have extensive backgrounds in community and economic development, and housing--to serve 2-4 years as community change agents in field offices. To date, 400 people have been hired. \\n   In Hartford, Connecticut, Community Builders have formed a partnership with state officials and national housing financial institutions to cross-train staff on the wide variety of housing finance programs and financing mechanisms available for the development of affordable housing. In addition, they have partnered with the Connecticut Department of Economic and Community Development, the Connecticut Housing Finance Agency, the National Equity Fund, the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston to improve coordination and ``layering\\'\\' of programs and delivery of services. \\n   These professionals bring a fresh perspective, the ability to think ``outside the box,\\'\\' and creative outlook on housing and community development programs. Community Builders in Connecticut illustrate the diversified experience and knowledge brought to HUD operations with professional backgrounds in the areas of architect, municipal government, law and business management. \\n   Community Builders are truly change agents in our community. They are knowledgeable about HUD programs, make customer service more efficient, are professionally competent, and are bringing their expertise to make government work better. \\n   I hope that the Senate will reconsider the significance of this program and provide continued support to ensure that our government maintains innovative, customer service oriented programs such as the Community Builders Program. \\n   I thank Senator KERRY and Secretary Cuomo taking action to ensure that working poor families have access to affordable housing and promoting new, innovative approaches to government management. I am proud to stand in support of their efforts. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990923\\n\\n    Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a reauthorization bill of critical importance to the future of Connecticut\\'s most valuable natural resource, the Long Island Sound. This bill, which I offer with my colleagues Mr. DODD, Mr. SCHUMER, and Mr. MOYNIHAN, reauthorizes the Long Island Sound Office through the year 2005, and increases the grant authorization amount to $10 million. \\n   The Long Island Sound is among the most complex estuaries in the National Estuary Program, both in terms of the physical features and scientific understanding of the estuary system, and in the context of ecosystem management. Unlike most estuaries, Long Island Sound has two connections to the sea. Rather than having a major source of fresh water at its head, flowing into a bay that empties into the ocean, Long Island Sound is open at both ends, flowing to the Atlantic Ocean to the east and to New York Harbor to the west. Most of its fresh water comes from a series of south-flowing rivers, including the Connecticut River, the Housatonic, and the Thames, whose drainages reach as far north as Canada. The Sound\\'s 16,000 square mile drainage basin also includes portions of New York City and Westchester, Nassau, and Suffolk Counties in New York State. The Sound combines this multiple inflow/outflow system with a diverse and complex shoreline, and an uneven bottom topography. Taken together, they produce unique and complex patterns of tide and currents. \\n   The interaction between the Sound and the local human population is also complex. The Sound is located in the midst of the most densely populated region of the United States. In total, more than 8 million people live in the Long Island Sound watershed and millions more flock yearly to the Sound for recreation. The Sound provides many other valuable uses, such as cargo shipping, ferry transportation and power generation. It is largely because the Sound serves such a concentrated population that the economic benefits of preserving and restoring the Sound are so substantial. More than $5.5 billion is generated annually in the regional economy from water quality-dependent activities such as boating, commercial and sport fishing, swimming, and beach going. \\n   In 1994, the Long Island Sound Management Conference, sponsored by the EPA, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, and the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection, completed a $15 million Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan (CCMP). That plan was adopted by the Governors of New York and Connecticut and the EPA Administrator. \\n   The EPA Long Island Sound Office coordinates the implementation of the plan among the many program partners, consistent with the Long Island Sound Improvement Act of 1990. The office is small, staffed by two EPA employees, whose salaries are covered by EPA\\'s base budget, and a Senior Environmental Employment Program secretary. In addition, the office supports two outreach positions, with one in each state. It avoids duplicating existing efforts and programs, instead focusing on better coordination of federal and state funds, educating and involving the public in the Sound cleanup and protection, and providing grants to support implementation of the Long Island Sound restoration effort. By coordinating the activities of numerous stakeholders involved in the Sound\\'s management program, in addition to serving as an educational and informational interface with the public, the Long Island Sound office provides an integral local outreach and meeting point. \\n   While the quality of the Sound has improved dramatically over the years, there is still much work to be done. Implementation of the CCMP will help restore fish populations that have been impacted by hypoxia, will improve and restore degraded wetlands, and will begin to address the toxic mercury pollution that has lead to health advisories for fish consumption in many of the Sound\\'s waters. Specific near term goals of the office include reducing nitrogen loadings which degrade water quality by depleting the Sound of oxygen, supporting local watershed protection efforts to reduce nonpoint source pollution, monitoring and expanding scientific understanding of the Sound, and educating the public and regional stakeholders about the sound and cleanup activities. Federal, State, and private funds have been well-spent over the years to research the conditions in the Sound and to identify conservation needs. We are now moving to apply critical funding toward implementing these projects, directly improving the water quality and habitat of the Long Island Sound. \\n   Overall, recent federal funding of the program and the office are small relative to state commitments. New York State has approved $200 million for Long Island Sound as part of a $1.75 billion bound act. Connecticut has awarded more than $200 million in the past three years to support upgrades at sewage treatment plants and is a national leader on wetlands restoration. The Long Island Sound Office now faces a daunting task, orchestrating a multi-billion dollar effort to implement efforts to reduce nitrogen loadings that degrade the waters of the Sound. The modest increase in the authorization levels, and the reauthorization of the Long Island Sound Office, therefore represent timely, important contributions to the cooperative regional effort to restore the waters of the Long Island Sound. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990915\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my strong support for the bipartisan effort to remove yet another anti-environment rider from an important appropriations bill. This rider, which is attached to the House Transportation Appropriations bill, would prohibit the Department of Transportation from even considering an increase in the corporate average fuel economy standard (CAFE). This rider would prevent DOT from evaluating, in any way, the cost-effectiveness and pollution-prevention dividends that could result from requiring greater fuel efficiency from cars and trucks. \\n   I am particularly concerned with this anti-CAFE rider, in part, because it is another in a long line of riders designed to limit our government\\'s ability to consider meaningful, appropriate, effective, and economical strategies to combat local and regional air pollution as well as global climate change. \\n   More than 117 million Americans live in places where smog makes their air unsafe to breathe. Nearly one-third of this pollution, which aggravates respiratory diseases, especially among vulnerable groups such as children, asthmatics, and the elderly, is emitted from car and truck tailpipes. \\n   Cost-effectively protecting people\\'s health by improving local air quality requires that we consider each of the sources that contribute to the pollution problem. It just makes sense that any efficient, fair, and reasonable pollution prevention strategy should consider all sources of pollution, including vehicles. \\n   There are many ways to address pollution from cars and trucks. For example, more rigorous emissions limits are currently being proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency. Efficiency standards represent another approach. The original CAFE standards have helped keep fuel consumption nearly 30 percent lower than if CAFE had not been implemented. Efficiency standards led to dramatic improvements in other sectors as well, such as major appliances. The purpose of the clean air resolution is not to mandate one approach over another but to allow the Administration to explore the benefits and costs of all the options. \\n   From a global perspective, there is a growing scientific and international consensus that air pollution, largely caused by burning fuels such as coal and oil, is causing changes in the earth\\'s climate. I believe that America has a moral obligation to meet the tremendous challenge of climate change head on rather than leaving a bigger problem for our children and grandchildren. \\n   As the world\\'s biggest emitter of the pollution that contributes to climate change, the United States has the responsibility to lead the international community toward a solution. And because our cars and trucks currently represent nearly one-third of America\\'s greenhouse gas emissions, and projections suggest that our miles driven will increase by roughly 2% a year through the next decade, vehicle emissions are a big part of a giant challenge. \\n   A recent report by the Alliance to Save Energy, the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, and several other groups, found enhanced CAFE standards to be an essential part of a comprehensive strategy to address global climate change. The study found that increased CAFE standards could be part of a plan to achieve a 10% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions while creating 800,000 jobs and saving $21 billion annually in reduced oil imports. \\n   Improving the gas mileage of the cars and trucks we drive would provide many other benefits to both the consumer and the country. Whereas less money spent at the pump means more money in Americans\\' pockets, less money spent at the pump also means less dependence on unpredictable imported oil. \\n   Unfortunately, there is an active misinformation campaign underway opposing the clean air resolution and CAFE standards. Chief among the claims is that the CAFE standards we have had for the last 25 years kill people. This is a ludicrous argument underpinned by contorted misinterpretations of long-since refuted assumptions. One simple observation puts CAFE opponents faulty logic to rest: since CAFE standards were adopted in 1973, the number of deaths per mile driven have been cut in half. The increased safety of our vehicles is largely attributable to material and design improvements that increase fuel efficiency at the same time they improve acceleration, braking, handling, durability and crashworthiness. \\n   Finally, I would alert my colleagues to a poll released yesterday regarding fuel efficiency standards. The poll, which was conducted by the Mellman Group for the World Wildlife Fund, indicates that 72% of sport utility vehicle (SUVs) owners believe that minivans and trucks should be held to the same efficiency standards as passenger cars. In addition, nearly two-thirds SUV owners support Congressional action to require equitable emissions requirements for cars and light trucks. \\n   The clean air resolution introduced today by Senators GORTON, FEINSTEIN, BRYAN, and REED ensures that enhanced CAFE standards are on the menu of options when the Department of Transportation considers the implications of vehicle efficiency for local, regional, and global air pollution, consumer protection and satisfaction, and energy security. I encourage my colleagues to support the clean air resolution. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-2-19990915\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from North Carolina had yielded back his time. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-3-19990915\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. I note I support the resolution and yield back the remainder of the time on this side as well. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990914\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to express my regret that the Interior Appropriations bill under consideration here includes no money for the Save America\\'s Treasury Campaign. I would like to describe one of the many important projects that will go unrealized for lack of funding. This valuable project is the preservation of the Mark Twain House in Hartford, Connecticut, and construction of a complementary education and visitor center near the house. \\n   Mark Twain wrote seven major books, including ``Tom Sawyer\\'\\' and the ``Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,\\'\\' while living with his family in the house, which he built in 1874. It is projected that the visitor\\'s center would help double--to a total of 100,000--the annual number of visitors to Mark Twain House and contribute an estimated 12 million dollars every year to the Connecticut economy. \\n   If money does come available for the Save America\\'s Treasures Campaign, would you agree that the Mark Twain House should be high on the priority list? \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-2-19990914\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank Senator GORTON. I appreciate his hard work on this important legislation. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990909\\n\\n    Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to offer introductory remarks on the Natural Resources Reinvestment Act, a bill that I am introducing today with my colleagues Mr. CHAFEE, Mr. LEAHY, and Mr. JEFFORDS. Before we adjourned for the summer recess, Congress spent many weeks preoccupied with weighty fiscal matters like how to divvy up a hypothetical budget surplus, whether to grant tax cuts with money that may or may not exist, or whether to do the responsible thing and pay off the national debt with any surplus that might actually materialize. Make no mistake, these are important issues, but they are not the only issues that should cause us concern. Recent visits with citizens in Connecticut reinforced my conviction that one of the most critical, but commonly overlooked, issues facing our nation today is the conservation debt that we have amassed in recent years. \\n   This conservation debt is difficult to define because it cannot be measured in dollars and cents. It is not dependent on interest rates or stock market gyrations. It is not a debt that can be paid off by signing a check when eventually we realize that we have short-changed our children\\'s environmental inheritance. \\n   This conservation debt grows as urban sprawl spreads across prime farmland and degrades wetlands. It is a debt that multiples every time a community misses a chance to acquire the watershed lands that help to purify their drinking water. It is a debt that grows irreversibly every time another endangered species is driven down the one-way road to extinction. It is a debt that increases each time an untended urban park is ceded to drug-peddlers through neglect and inattention. It is a debt that builds every time a structure representing our cultural heritage is demolished rather than renovated. It is a debt that we can no longer afford to ignore. \\n   Unfortunately, too little has been said or done recently in Washington to define the steps we--as a nation--should take to pay off the conservation debt and ensure that our children and grandchildren inherit a planet that is healthy, productive, and blessed with abundant, clean, green open space. \\n   Because I am committed to preserving a rich environmental legacy for our children, today I join with Mr. CHAFEE, from Rhode Island, the esteemed Chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee on which I serve, and Mr. LEAHY and Mr. JEFFORDS from Vermont to introduce the Natural Resources Reinvestment Act of 1999. \\n   The principle behind our bill is simple: as we deplete federally-owned, non-renewable natural resources such as oil and gas, we should reinvest the proceeds to establish a reliable source of funding for State, local, and federal efforts to conserve land and water, provide recreational opportunities, preserve historic resources, protect fish and wildlife, and preserve open space. The Natural Resources Reinvestment Act honors this principle by re-establishing America\\'s long-standing commitment to protecting land, fish and wildlife, and our cultural heritage and by re-doubling Federal commitments that help states and localities protect the open space and recreational opportunities that Americans cherish so deeply. \\n   Notwithstanding our current conservation debt, America has made many wise conservation investments over the years. Therefore, the Natural Resources Reinvestment Act is not spun \\n   entirely from whole cloth, but also improves upon those things we have done well. For example, the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which has served as the primary Federal source of funds for the acquisition of recreational lands since 1965, has been a tremendous success by any measure. It has helped protect more than seven million acres of open space and contributed to the development of 37,000 parks and recreation areas across the country. Everglades and Saguaro National Parks, the Appalachian Trail, the Martin Luther King, Jr., National Historic Site, and Niagara Falls are few examples of treasured places across the country that have been created or protected with help from the Land and Water Conservation Fund.  \\n   Because the Outer Continental Shelf petroleum royalty system is already in collecting billions of dollars every year, rather than introducing new taxes, this bill would simply ensure that taxes historically raised for conservation purposes actually result in conservation activity. Despite the notable successes and broad bipartisan support and authorization for $900 million dollars, Congress has failed to appropriate sufficient money for Land and Water Conservation Fund. More than $11 billion dollars of authorized conservation funding has been funneled back into the general treasury since the Fund was established. Again, this bill requires no new taxes----it simply ensures that existing revenues are spent on the conservation priorities that communities across the country have identified. \\n   The stateside portion of the Land and Water Conservation Fund--the money that is supposed to help states and local communities direct their own conservation and recreation goals--has gone completely unfunded since 1995. This is particularly troubling for me because Connecticut has the smallest percentage of federally-owned land of any state in the union. \\n   The Natural Resources Reinvestment Act ensures that the Land and Water Conservation Fund will receive full authorized funding every year. The bill also builds on the success of the Fund, by authorizing a new program for State Lands of National or Regional Interest to help protect areas of unique ecological, recreational, aesthetic, or regional value that would not be eligible for traditional Land and Water Conservation Fund support. We also provide full funding for other successful programs with an existing claim on Outer Continental Shelf revenues, including the Historic Preservation Fund, and the Urban Park and Recreation Recovery program. Every year our bill will reinvest $250 million dollars of Outer Continental Shelf petroleum revenues in State fish and wildlife conservation efforts, with special emphasis on projects that protect nongame and threatened or endangered species. \\n   The Natural Resources Reinvestment Act also creates a $900 million Environmental Stewardship Fund to be distributed to States for the purposes of conserving, protecting, and restoring their natural resources beyond what is required by current law. The Environmental Stewardship Fund is designed so that States have the flexibility to devise innovative solutions to their individual conservation challenges. This commitment to helping, but not dictating how, communities achieve their conservation goals is exceptionally important. \\n   Over the last year, the State of Connecticut has acquired 3,725 acres of open space worth more that $15 million dollars in 24 different municipalities. These open space purchases represent important steps toward the state goal of setting aside 21% of Connecticut land as open space. However, that goal is still more than 345,000 acres away from being reality. Each state has unique conservation and recreation priorities and the NRRA ensures that they will have flexible federal assistance they need to put their plans into practice. Because the NRRA would support diverse ideas and approaches to conserving and protecting the nation\\'s natural and cultural resources, each state will also benefit from the innovation and lessons learned by other \\n   states from coast to coast. \\n   Finally, the Natural Resources Reinvestment Act clarifies and improves existing laws to leverage opportunities to protect farmland and watersheds, and mitigate the extent to which transportation projects encroach on open and green space. While these improvements are made in federal laws, they affect local decisions. For example, the NRRA amends the 1996 Farm Bill so that state and local conservation organizations can help acquire easements designed to maintain productive farmland as productive farms. This provision of the NRRA gives communities a powerful tool to help make sure that family farms are not squeezed out of American communities as cities and towns grow and prosper in the 21st century. \\n   By amending the Federal Water Pollution Control Act so that up to 10% of the State Revolving Loan Fund can be used for matching grants to purchase land that protects watersheds, the NRRA recognizes that flexibility is critical for cost-effective delivery of clean and healthy drinking water to American homes and businesses. This provision of the NRRA recognizes that protecting watersheds--the Earth\\'s natural water filtration and purification systems--by preserving open space can be an important and relatively inexpensive component of municipal water supply strategies. \\n   America\\'s world-class network of roads and highways represents the foundation of our national commerce. It also embodies many families\\' tickets to staying in touch with friends and relatives across the country and their passports for exploring the beauty and history of our nation. The NRRA amends the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st century so that highway development funds can be used to purchase open space and green corridors that will help mitigate the effects of transportation-related growth and development. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990908\\n\\n    Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the Colchester Lions Club of Colchester, CT. On October 30, they will be celebrating their 50th anniversary of service to the Colchester community. \\n   The Colchester Lions Club was established on August 2, 1949, and through the support of area residents, they have reached out to assist many members of the community. The Lions Club has lent its support to such worthwhile local causes as the D.A.R.E. Program for schools, academic scholarships for local students, and area food banks, and senior centers. They also have reached far beyond the Town of Colchester by raising funds for organizations such as the Fidelco Guide Dog Foundation and Lions Clubs International. \\n   As the Colchester Lions Club has grown over the years, their numerous good works have touched many lives and demonstrated the true value of volunteerism. The people of Connecticut thank the Colchester Lions Club and all its members for their service, dedication, and contribution to our State.  \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990805\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. I believe the Senator from Virginia yielded a couple minutes to me earlier. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-2-19990805\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I first thank those who have finally brought the nomination of Richard Holbrooke to the floor of the Senate, particularly the senior Senator from North Carolina and the senior Senator from Virginia, Mr. WARNER, who have done yeoman\\'s work here in the national interest. \\n   Secondly, I wanted to say this about the nominee himself, who I have been privileged to come to know. In my opinion, Richard Holbrooke is one of America\\'s great natural resources. Certainly, he is one of our great diplomatic resources. He has had a career that has been described in detail here that puts him at the top ranks of those who have served America in the international arena. He is a person of principle, purpose, intellect, and enormous energy and talent. He combines the sense of American purpose, which, incidentally, is reflected in his work on behalf of the policy of the United States, representing the Commander in Chief of the United States in regard to the Balkans, about which my friend from Texas has just spoken. He combines that sense of American principle and the continuing vitality of America\\'s morality in the world with extraordinary, tough-minded, practical, and interpersonal diplomatic skills. \\n   We are fortunate to have a person of this talent willing to serve our Nation. I am confident that he will advance our national security and principled interests in the United Nations. I am proud to support the nomination. \\n   I thank the Chair and yield the floor. \\n   Mr. HAGEL addressed the Chair. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990805\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues. \\n   I rise to oppose this conference report and the $800 billion tax cut it contains. I do not rise reflexively. In fact, my reflex, similar to most of my colleagues, is to support tax cuts, not to oppose them. \\n   I was proud just 2 years ago to be a lead cosponsor, for instance, of the cut in the capital gains tax and to support so many of the initiatives of the chairman of the Finance Committee in encouraging savings. However, I am going to oppose this tax cut as I would tax cuts at any time when they were not needed to help our economy, not justified by the availability of money to support the tax cut. These are similar arguments I made against the reconciliation bill, this tax cut, when it was before the Senate last week. \\n   It reappears as a conference report. It is essentially the same. The chairs have been shuffled on this Titanic, but the fact remains that this big luxury liner of a tax cut is headed for an iceberg. It may well take the American economy down with it. The iceberg here is the cold, hard reality that there is no surplus to pay for the cut that this enacts. In fact, this Congress, in an act of legislative schizophrenia, is on one side saying there is a surplus, beginning with next year, that justifies this tax cut; on the other side, through fictional emergency appropriations, through double counting, through overspending, is spending more than the surplus projected for next year. \\n   So that  the reality is that ``there is no there there.\\'\\' There is no surplus there to pay for this tax cut. \\n   My colleagues cite the Congressional Budget Office saying there will be, for instance, a $14 billion surplus next year and almost $1 trillion over the 10 years. But, as has been said on the floor, CBO, after making those surplus projections, also issued a report which makes very clear that they are based on Congress exercising self-control, the kind of self-control over spending we are showing each day of this session we are unable to exercise. \\n   If you take the $1 trillion surplus the Congressional Budget Office estimated and then simply assume that Congresses over the next 10 years spends only the amount of money to operate our Government that we are spending this year, in 1999, adjusted only for inflation--real dollars--then that projected surplus of $1 trillion suddenly becomes $46 billion. What does it require to hold the $1 trillion surplus? Cuts in spending that we all know are untenable. They are not going to happen. This Congress, and no Congress over the next decade, would enact them. \\n   I am privileged to serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee. I think in that capacity I have learned some about the needs of our national security and our military, our defense. To achieve the $1 trillion surplus and live within the caps that currently exist would require cuts in defense spending over the next decade of approximately $200 billion. We cannot fulfill our constitutional responsibility to provide for the common defense of the United States of America over the next decade with $200 billion in cuts. \\n   I have too much confidence in my colleagues who serve today, as well as those who will serve over the next decade, to believe we would ever so jeopardize our security. It is just another way of saying the surplus projections are not real, and therefore enacting a tax cut which will not be backed up by available revenue will take America back down the road to a deficit before we hardly have had a chance to even appreciate the possibilities of a surplus. \\n   Let us remember also a $1 trillion surplus estimate is based not only on a capacity in Congress to cut spending that we have clearly shown already in this session we do not possess because it is based on a projection of continued 2.4-percent growth in our economy over the next decade, extending what is already the longest peacetime growth in an economy in our history. Just look at the news in the last week or two and consider the probability that we will continue to grow over this next 10 years, unimpeded by the world and events in the world. The value of the dollar has weakened in recent weeks, creating great alarm in other industrialized democracies, particularly in Europe and Japan, our close allies, for fear of what that will do to their economies, and also for fear of what that will do to the foreign dollars that are currently invested in our economy that may be withdrawn and the consequences that would have for our economy. \\n   Have you been following the stock market in recent days and watching the extraordinary gyrations in the American market which show underlying unease? Do we want to put into that situation a large tax cut, a tax cut of this immense size that will further threaten inflation and instability in our economy? Why? Why take the risk? Fiscal responsibility helped to bring our economy to the point it is today: An unprecedented \\n   combination of high growth, low unemployment, low inflation. Why risk it all for a tax cut that is not needed to stimulate the economy and not demanded by the people of the United States of America? \\n   I think we have to be conscious of how our fiscal actions affect the very global economy which helps to give us our strength. We are the only G-7 country running a budget surplus today. We are the only leading industrial economy that is positioned to deal with the global demographic challenge of retiring baby boomers, if we discipline ourselves. As Asia and South America struggle through economic difficulties, we must remember that any sign of economic instability here could trigger an economic crisis there that will come back to bite us. We must have a strong economy. We have one now. Why jeopardize it? Why encumber it with debt? Why not save this money, pay down the debt, store it up to weather any economic crisis that may come our way? \\n   There are times when I think of the famous Biblical story where Joseph advised Pharaoh in good times to put some away because good times would not last forever. I think we are in such a time now so we dare not let the cows and corn absorb themselves, as occurred in Joseph\\'s dream. \\n   The result, I fear, is by passing a major tax cut, one paid by an imaginary surplus, we would incur sizable debts for years to come. Besides the effects on the financial markets and on our economy, we would leave little or no money available for building the solvency of Medicare and Social Security and thus raise the specter of a major tax increase down the line when we will least be able to afford it to compensate for our profligacy now. \\n   Finally, as has been said, I think anybody who has been following what Chairman Greenspan has been saying does not have to pick at the tea leaves. It has been very clear. If we cut taxes to this size now, the Federal Reserve will increase interest rates soon after. That will help to depress the economy and also hit average working Americans literally where they live, driving up the cost of their mortgages, their car payments, their credit card bills, and student loans to the point it would dwarf any tax benefit they might receive from this conference report. \\n   I present as evidence an analysis done for Business Week magazine by Regional Financial Associates of West Chester, PA, which says that wiping out the debt, the national debt, by 2014 would raise the economy\\'s growth rate by more than one-quarter of 1 percent at the end of the 15 years, and that real annual household income would grow by $1,500. That is more than three times, this study shows, what a tax cut of this size would boost the GDP and household income. A tax cut such as the one passed in the House, according to this study, would raise household income by $400; whereas paying down the debt would raise household income by $1,500. \\n   So I will vote against the conference report and say when the President vetoes this bill he will not just be making another smart partisan political move in a political chess game; he will be saving the American economy from real damage. \\n   I thank the Chair and yield the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990805\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to offer a few remarks on an amendment I have at the desk. The amendment, which I intend to withdraw, would provide a $2 million increase in funding for the Parks Service Account. This money would be used to help a dedicated coalition of Connecticut citizens, conservation groups, and local and state government acquire 668 acres in the Trout Brook Valley. \\n   The Trout Brook Valley, like much of the remaining open space in Connecticut, is currently under threat of development and the Aspetuck Land Trust is trying to save it. They are not asking the Federal Government to foot the entire bill in the effort to preserve this countryside for the enjoyment of future generations. Far from it, the locally-led effort to save Trout Brook Valley is convinced that they can and will raise $10.5 million of the $12.5 million dollars that the property will cost. My amendment would have provided Federal matching funds equal to less than one-sixth of the total cost of acquiring this land for conservation. \\n   I am deeply disappointed that the current Interior Appropriations bill allocates no funding to the stateside portion of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The Trout Brook Valley project represents an excellent example of why we need to appropriate adequate resources for stateside portion of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which tragically has gone unfunded since 1995. I am encouraged to learn, however, that an agreement to appropriate funds to the stateside LWCF account is currently under discussion. Am I correct in that understanding? \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-2-19990805\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. I understand that, and respectfully withdraw my amendment. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990805\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to praise S. 296, the Federal Research Investment Act of 1999, legislation designed to reverse a downward trend in the Federal Government\\'s allocation to science and engineering research and development (R&D). S. 296 authorizes a 5.5% increase in funding per year for federally funded civilian R&D programs, through 2010. While the future of individual agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health or the National Science Foundation, remains with the authorizing committees, the bill establishes a long term commitment to sustaining the aggregate research and development portfolio during the annual budget cycle. The bill also puts in place a number of review and accountability measures to assure the public and Congress that, each year, the R&D funds are well spent. I am pleased to report that S. 296 passed the Senate last week, on July 28, 1999, by unanimous consent. It had 41 cosponsors, about equally divided between the two parties, including the Majority and Minority leaders. The magnitude of support for this bill reflects the growing realization that technological progress is the single largest factor, bar none, in sustaining economic growth. \\n   Today we find ourselves in a ``New Economy.\\'\\' Everything about it defies conventional wisdom. Our unemployment rate is extremely low, but at the same time, our interest rates are low. The boom itself keeps going, defying expectations. In fact, the current economic boom is soon to be the longest one in our nation\\'s history. Even our national debt has fallen far faster than economists had ever predicted it could. In retrospect, these happy miscalculations reflect a flaw in economic growth theory. Conventional economic wisdom at first underestimated the strength and depth of our New Economy because it ignored the substantial productivity gains generated by advances in technology, in this particular case, information technology. However, had we paid attention to history, we would have known better.  \\n   Almost a dozen major economic studies, including those of Nobel Prize laureate Robert Solow, have tracked economic growth over prior decades. These studies found that in every time period studied, approximately half of all economic growth was due to technological progress. The preponderance of the evidence provided by these economic studies has led Alan Greenspan to note in many of his recent speeches that in addition to the traditional forces of labor and capital, a very substantial portion of economic growth is now recognized to be due to technological innovation and the productivity increases it brings to the workplace. That technological innovation is what is sustaining our boom today. Beyond the effects of interest rates and fiscal policy, there are the dot.com\\'s and the gazelle stocks, pushing our nation\\'s technological wunderkind into untold riches, and pulling the rest of the nation along with them. \\n   In an industrialized nation, the technological innovation so necessary for robust economic growth is generated by research and development (R&D). R&D is directly responsible for creation of the new products and processes which account for half or more of the growth in output per person, thereby fueling our economy. The private sector recognizes these connections--earlier this summer, Business Week devoted a entire issue, over a hundred pages, to highlighting the greatest scientific and technological innovations of the past 100 years. As the noted economist Lester Thurow puts it, ``The payoff from social investment in basic research is as clear as anything is ever going to be in economics.\\'\\' To drive home the economic impact of scientific R&D, I would like to bring up the specific example of biomedical research, which at least one analysis finds has a rate of return that is greater than $13 for every dollar invested. \\n   This correlation between technology and economic growth is especially compelling today, and not just for the biomedical arena. On a local scale, scores of governors are striving to bring high tech corridors into their states. They know, intuitively, that future economic growth for their states depends on high tech. America\\'s research-intensive industries have been growing at about twice the rate of the average economy over the past two decades. Job opportunities in information technology flood the newspaper want ads, an illustration of the Internet sector\\'s 1.2 million new jobs in 1998. Moreover, high tech wages are 77% greater than the private sector average. \\n   However, we have reached a cross-roads in this era of technological growth. We must remember that the ultimate origins of today\\'s high-tech companies, and hence the dramatic economic gains we now see, were a few seminal discoveries made in the mid-1960\\'s. It was at that time that we, as a country, were seriously investing in research and development. Because of the 20-30 year time lag between basic scientific discovery and market product, that substantial federal investment is now bearing fruit in the form of our exceptionally robust economy in the 1990\\'s. \\n   Unfortunately, since the mid-1960\\'s we have not maintained our investment in R&D. As a fraction of the federal budget, the federal government\\'s support of R&D has dropped by 2/3 over the past 34 years. When expressed as a fraction of GDP, federal funding of R&D has declined to half its mid-1960\\'s value. For certain individual disciplines, the future is bleak. A recent report from the National Academy shows that in the years between 1993 and 1997, federal funding for research in mechanical engineering declined 50.4%, that for electrical engineering declined 35.7%, that for physics declined 28.7%, and that for chemical engineering declined 12.9%. These decreases are not just abstract reductions in facilities and personnel at research labs, and students and professors in universities. They represent the very seed corn of our economic prosperity. We no longer have as robust a pool of ideas to germinate into fundamentally new industries; we no longer have the technically trained populace capable of fully cultivating and implementing those ideas. Meanwhile, other countries are stepping in to fill the gap. Thirteen countries now have greater funding for basic research as a fraction of GNP than we do. For non-defense research, Japan spends more than the US, even in absolute dollars. \\n   The problem of declining US R&D funding is especially acute, and demands action now, because of the dynamics of the global economy. In order to compete in the global economy, industry R&D funding has become overwhelmingly (84%) and increasingly concentrated on product development/refinement, i.e, the last stage of R&D. Thus, for new product concepts, industry is correspondingly more dependent on the basic and applied research sponsored by the government. The connection is a direct one. Currently, 73% of all papers cited in industrial patents are the product of government and non-profit funded research. With our declining investment in government-funded R&D, coupled with the increased appetite of industry for new market products and technologically literate workers, the government is stripping US industry of the knowledge base required to derive new products and compete in new industries. \\n   We must also understand that this falloff in R&D will have serious economic repercussions into the future. Our investments in science and technology have an impact which stretches out over a twenty to thirty year horizon. Recognition of this fact is particularly crucial because of the projected dramatic rises in entitlement spending when the baby boom generation retires. To pay for Social Security, for Medicare, for all the hopes and dreams of our country, we will need a healthy economic harvest in years to come. Increasing our commitment to R&D today is the surest way to provide for the robust economy that is essential to our future social commitments. As Judy Carter, President and CEO of Softworks, points out, ``Without a growing economy, Americans\\' standard of living, and our ability to support the needs of our aging population will be in jeopardy. Faced with a static or decreasing workforce as U.S. demographics shift, U.S. lawmakers must focus on encouraging technology development to increase productivity, enabling a smaller workforce to support a growing population of retirees.\\'\\' \\n   We are doing well now economically because of our past R&D investments, but the declining R&D accounts bode poorly for our future. The Council on Competitiveness put it succinctly when it concluded, ``the United States may be living off historical assets that are not being renewed.\\'\\' It is time now to renew those investments. With its small but steady increases in the nation\\'s R&D accounts and its commitment to thoughtful planning and review of our R&D portfolio, The Federal Research Investment Act, S. 296, begins the replenishment of our consummate national treasure--our knowledge base. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990805\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am proud to join Chairman THOMPSON in introducing a bill that will re-authorize a small but highly effective program, the Emergency Food and Shelter Program, or EFS for short. The EFS program, which is administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, supplements community efforts to meet the needs of the homeless and hungry in all fifty states. I am pleased that my friend, Chairman THOMPSON, is sponsoring this legislation. Our Committee on Governmental Affairs has jurisdiction over the EFS program, and it is my hope that together we can generate even more bipartisan support for a program that makes a real difference with its tiny budget. The EFS program is a great help not only to the Nation\\'s homeless population but also to working people who are trying to feed and shelter their families at entry-level wages. Services supplemented by the EFS funding, such as food banks and emergency rent/utility assistance programs, are especially helpful to families with big responsibilities but small paychecks. \\n   One of the things that distinguishes the EFS program is the extent to which it relies on non-profit organizations. Local boards in counties, parishes, and municipalities across the country advertise the availability of funds, decide on non-profit and local government agencies to be funded, and monitor the recipient agencies. The local boards, like the program\\'s National Board, are made up of charitable organizations including the National Council of Churches, the United Jewish Communities, Catholic Charities, USA, the Salvation Army, and the American Red Cross. By relying on community participation, the program keeps administrative overhead to an unusually low amount, less than 3%. \\n   The EFS program has operated without authorization since 1994 but has been sustained by annual appropriations. The proposed bill will re-authorize the program for the next three years. It will also authorize modest funding increases over the amounts appropriated in recent years. From 1990 the EFS program was funded at approximately $130 million annually, but that number was cut back by appropriators in fiscal year 1996 and has held steady at $100 million since then. Creeping inflation has taken an additional bite: $130 million in 1990 dollars is equivalent to $165.6 million today. The draft legislation will authorize increases to $125 million in the coming fiscal year and an additional five million dollars each of the following two years. Although the increases will not bring the program\\'s funding up to its previous levels, they will provide additional aid to community-based organizations struggling to meet the needs of the homeless and working poor in an era of steep budget cuts. \\n   In summary, Mr. President, FEMA\\'s Emergency Food and Shelter Program is a highly efficient example of the government relying on the country\\'s non-profit organizations to help people in innovative ways. The EFS program aids the homeless and the hungry in a majority of the nation\\'s counties and in all fifty states, and I ask my colleagues to support this program and our re-authorizing legislation. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990802\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from Michigan. \\n   I am delighted to stand in support of defending S. 335, the Deceptive Mail Prevention and Enforcement Act. I commend my colleague from Michigan, along with Senators COLLINS, COCHRAN, and EDWARDS, for the way they have worked together with my former colleagues, the State attorneys general, the AARP, and the sweepstakes industry itself to put together this important consumer protection legislation. I think their combined efforts stand as a model not only of cooperation but of thoughtful legislating from which we can all learn. I am very proud to join them as a cosponsor of this bill. \\n   No marketing effort should be based on misleading advertising. That principle is at the core of the legislation before the Senate. It reminds everyone that occasionally the Federal Government has to step in to make sure that the free market we celebrate and benefit so much from truly remains free. That freedom is so often based on the truthfulness of representations made by those who are marketing. \\n   The purpose of this bill is to eliminate deceptive practices in the sweepstakes industry. We have all seen  them. Who wouldn\\'t be tantalized by a letter proclaiming you may already be a winner? It is hard not to open that one up. Everybody wants to be a winner. Most of us have probably fantasized about how we would spend a sudden windfall that dropped into our bank accounts. \\n   Unfortunately, sweepstakes mailings often involve sophisticated marketing techniques that persuade recipients to spend money in the hope of finding the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, but it is a long way off in almost all cases. Often the mailings are targeted at the elderly or the financially vulnerable who don\\'t realize that sweepstake companies are not in business primarily to rain riches down upon them. Sweepstakes companies are in business to sell products that make a profit, plain and simple. That is legitimate so long as they do it fairly and truthfully. \\n   It is a big business. The fact is that sweepstakes and telemarketing firms take in more than $400 million a year from promotional campaigns in my State of Connecticut alone. Nationally, estimates are that the sweepstakes in telemarketing firms have gross revenues between $40 and $60 billion a year. This legislation makes sure that before consumers take a chance on the sweepstakes, they know it is just that, a chance--not a winning ticket, not a prize, but a chance. They will know the odds are not improved no matter how many subscriptions they buy. \\n   This legislation requires a clear statement that no purchase is necessary to win, as well as terms and conditions of the promotion in language that is easy to find, to read, and to understand. It prohibits abuses we have seen such as symbols or statements that imply Federal Government endorsement, and it provides meaningful disclosures to let consumers know the actual odds of winning. \\n   Further, the bill sets up a mechanism for consumers and those who care for them to stop unwanted sweepstake \\n   solicitations and a recordkeeping requirement to assure that such requests are properly implemented. \\n   Finally, the bill gives the Postal Service the additional enforcement authority it needs to stop unlawful sweepstake schemes, particularly those that flirt with fraud and skip from State to State. \\n   I strongly support this legislation as a tool to help consumers negotiate their way through the high pressure sales tactics sometimes employed by marketers using sweepstakes to sell their products. I am very grateful to colleagues on the Governmental Affairs Committee for the leadership they have shown. \\n   I am delighted to join this bipartisan effort to protect our citizens--again, particularly the aged--from these deceptive marketing tactics. I urge the Senate to vote for this strong consumer protection measure. I hope the House will then join in adopting this bill and sending it to the President. \\n   I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990730\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, in the interest of legislative efficiency, let alone fiscal responsibility, Senator LEVIN and I are withdrawing our motion to strike the entire tax cut and joining to raise the same issue with Senator HOLLINGS on this amendment which says you can\\'t have a tax cut if the surplus is not there, and there is no evidence the surplus is there. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990729\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment before the Senate introduced by my friends from Rhode Island and Louisiana. But in doing so, I rise to oppose all of the amendments that have been offered to cut taxes. \\n   It is particularly difficult for me to rise and speak against this amendment offered by this centrist group. It contains some of my dearest friends and closest collaborators in the Senate. I have parted company with them only after much consternation and consideration. I do so because, if they will allow me to say so, I think the centrist course we would best follow in this case is to stay right in the middle of the road that has brought the American economy to the extraordinary point of growth and strength it occupies today, and that is the road of fiscal responsibility. It took a lot of hard work to get us to this plentiful place that we are enjoying today, with high growth, low unemployment, a surprisingly high stock market, and surprisingly low inflation. \\n   I think the Federal Government helped to begin it all by creating the climate for sustained economic growth by exercising some real fiscal discipline. Then most of the prosperity has come, as it always does in America, from the private sector, from millions of businesses and individuals, innovating, cooperating, and profiting. Now, as a result, for the first time in a generation it looks as if the Federal Government may actually go into surplus--if we let it. \\n   Oscar Wilde once wrote, ``I can resist everything except temptation.\\'\\' I fear the same may well be said of this Congress as it giddily proceeds to spend a surplus that no one knows is really  there, that would take our Nation back into deficit and endanger the critical economic gains we have made over the past several years. \\n   So I ask, why not stay the course that has raised the standard of living of millions of American families? Why not wait for at least another year to see if the surplus projections are real, if the economy will continue to grow, if Congress is prepared to exercise the required spending discipline? That is the question Senator LEVIN and I will ask later on a motion to strike the entire tax cut before us, which would mean we would wait a year. It is the question that Senator HOLLINGS will ask in an amendment we will offer later which would recommit this tax cut to committee. \\n   I must say, as all of us here, I suppose my reflex is to propose tax cuts, not to oppose them. I was very active in support of the tax cuts we passed--just 2 years ago. I think sometimes we forget that in this debate. Just 2 years ago, I cosponsored the cut in the capital gains tax and supported so many of the incentives that the chairman of the Finance Committee offered to increase savings in our country. I would welcome the opportunity to vote for a balanced, thoughtfully crafted tax reduction package such as the one the Senators from Rhode Island and Louisiana have offered today if I were convinced we could afford it, if I were convinced the money was there to support the tax cut, or, in the alternative, if I thought, as Chairman Greenspan has suggested, that the economy needed it, needed to be stimulated. \\n   But the more I have looked at these protections of a $1 trillion surplus over the next decade, the more it looks to me like a Potemkin surplus--not a real one, a facade with nothing \\n   behind it because it is based on projections of 2.4-percent growth over the next 10 years, which may happen but would extend what is already the longest peacetime expansion of our economy in history. It is possible, but I would not bank on it, or at least I would not spend in tax cuts the profits of such unprecedented projected growth until I knew they were in the bank. \\n   Of course, both baselines, OMB\\'s and CBO\\'s, assume cuts in spending that are massive and unsustainable. These are cuts that few in either House would ever support and, in fact, are not supporting right now, as Congress simply exceeds the budget almost every day, exceeds the caps through transparent accounting gimmicks, calling excess spending emergency spending and double counting when necessary. \\n   In other words, we do not have to wonder whether Congress over the next decade will be able to hold the spending line on which the surplus, which would fund these tax cuts, is contingent because Congress is already proving today that it cannot so control itself. The result is that by passing a major tax cut, paid for by a surplus that probably will not be there, we would likely incur sizable deficits for years to come. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-2-19990729\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. I ask the Senator from Delaware if I might have 2 more minutes off the bill. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-3-19990729\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator. \\n   On top of that, of course, we would leave little or no money available for building the solvency of Medicare and Social Security, for supporting our national security--defense--and we would thus raise the specter of a major tax increase down the line to compensate for our profligacy right now. \\n   It seems quite clear from what Alan Greenspan is saying, if we cut taxes now, the Fed will increase interest rates soon thereafter, which would put a drag on the economy, slow down business investment, and probably lower the stock market, and it would hit average working Americans literally where they live, driving up the cost of their mortgages, car payments, credit card bills, and student loans to the point where it would dwarf any tax benefit most Americans would receive from this bill. \\n   In other words, we would be robbing Paul to pay--Paul, while simultaneously robbing our economy of the dynamism we have labored so hard to create. And to what purpose? None that I have heard, except to return to the American people a surplus that is not going to be there. \\n   What we need now, I argue, is a little more of the fiscal discipline and responsibility that helped bring this economy to the point of great growth it is at now. \\n   I thank the Senator from Delaware, and I yield the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990721\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Mr. DOMENICI\\'s amendment to the Department of Energy reorganization amendment. I have been a strong supporter of the need to reorganize the defense labs in order to improve security and I applaud the sponsors of the reorganization amendment that we will be considering. It is of overriding importance that we take all necessary actions to protect our national security. \\n   However, as I have considered the very serious need to address security threats, I have also been listening closely to the debate about how environment, safety, and health protections can best be incorporated into the Department of Energy\\'s operations as they relate to the weapons labs. \\n   The legacy of the Atomic Energy Commission and the Department of Energy regarding environmental protection is not a proud one. Since the first days of the Atomic Energy Commission over 40 years ago, weapons production programs and facilities emphasized production and too often neglected environmental safety. By the 1980s, the history of mismanagement caught up with the Agency, when 17 major plants in 13 states, employing 80,000 people were brought to a standstill because of a series of accidents and leaks. Over 10,000 individual sites have been documented where toxic or radioactive substances were improperly abandoned or released into soil, groundwater, or surface waters. ``Tiger Teams\\'\\' of trained investigators were sent to plants to ensure compliance with environmental and safety requirements. The Agency and the public have paid for the cost of this mismanagement: the price tag of past mistakes is now at about $250 billion dollars, or $6 billion a year. Clearly we have to learn from the past as we think about how to deal with environment and safety in the future. \\n   Based on the Rudman report, there is a strong case made for treating environment and safety issues separately. Our former colleague Warren Rudman himself has said that environment and health issues ``ought to stay where they ought to stay, with the Secretary ..... because I know what we all went through back during the 1980s.\\'\\' GAO has testified on numerous occasions that independent oversight is critical to ensuring adequate protection of health and safety. They have said explicitly that this oversight needs to encompass on-site reviews of compliance with environmental and safety laws. \\n   Much has changed since the time that rampant disregard for environmental protections at the labs was discovered. Over time, we as a society, within industry, and within government have come to incorporate environment and health concerns more fully into both policy and practice. And I have no reason to believe that there would be any intentional disregard for environmental and health concerns if the those functions were put under the supervision of the Agency for Nuclear Stewardship. However, given the potential magnitude of problems that could be caused even by simple, honest mistakes, the best course of action is to be prudent. I therefore support the Domenici amendment because it allows the Secretary of the Department of Energy to ensure compliance with all environmental, safety and health requirements, while protecting the security of the weapons labs. I am pleased that we were able to work out this issue as part of the restructuring proposal. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990715\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I have been proud to join with Senators CHAFEE, GRAHAM, and other colleagues to express our shared dissatisfaction with the Senate\\'s progress in reaching agreement on a strong patients\\' bill of rights, and to prepare a balanced, thoughtfully-crafted alternative that we believe would protect the rights of health consumers and could attract the support of a bipartisan majority of the Senate. \\n   Listening to the deeply partisan discussions we have heard on the floor this week, I am reminded of the movie ``As Good As It Gets,\\'\\' which has become a cultural touchstone of sorts for venting the popular hostility toward HMOs.  \\n   It is not any particular scene I am thinking of, but the title itself. I am moved to wonder if this debate, which seems to be operating on political autopilot and showing no signs of producing anything other than a Presidential veto, is as good as we get in the U.S. Senate, and as good it gets for the American people, who don\\'t know a second degree amendment from a first degree amendment, but who do know that our managed care system badly needs a transfusion of basic fairness and accountability. \\n   We are here today to say that we can and should do better for America\\'s families, that despite the apparent legislative logjam it is still possible to pass a constructive reform proposal, and that we are eager to offer a plan that Senators CHAFEE, GRAHAM, and many of us have been fine-tuning over the last few days which fits that bill. \\n   While Sherlock Holmes had the 7% solution, we are offering a 70% solution. \\n   Our bipartisan alternative includes roughly 70 percent of the patient protections that most Members already agree on, and strikes some balanced compromises on the remaining issues that continue to divide us. \\n   The liability provisions in our bill are an example of our success in finding a sensible middle ground. \\n   This case, the managed care case, reminds me why we have tort law; why we have negligence law; why we have a system of civil justice. There has been this odd result that ERISA has given total immunity to managed care plans who are today making life and death decisions about our lives. \\n   The question is, how do we respond to that, how do we reform it? I think, with all respect that the Democratic bill goes too far. \\n   It opens up the system to the unlimited right to sue and creates the same prospect for the lotteries that have been going on elsewhere in the tort system. I am concerned that those ills will be repeated here--some will get rich and others, many others, will not be adequately compensated for the injuries they suffer as the result of the managed care plan decisions. \\n   And some small businesses and individual people will be priced out of health insurance by the costs that will be added as a result of runaway judgements. \\n   I think the Republican plan, on the other hand, is not real reform because it essentially allows a patient, who is harmed by a negligent decision of a managed care plan, to be denied any significant compensation for their injury. \\n   Under the Republican plan, patients have to traverse an elaborate series of procedural hurdles to be eligible for compensatory damages. First, the patient has to fight their way through the appeals process. Then the independent appeals body must grant a decision in favor of the patient. Finally, if the plan doesn\\'t accept and deliver that treatment, then, under the Republican bill, the only right the aggrieved health care consumer has, is to go to court for the value of that lost treatment, plus $100 a day. \\n   The amendment on liability which Senator GREGG offered went far beyond striking the liability provisions from the Democratic bill and would deny efforts to adequately compensate patients injured because of managed care plan decisions. \\n   That\\'s just not enough. \\n   I think we\\'ve struck a reasonable compromise in our bipartisan bill. You\\'re entitled to sue for economic loss which includes not only the cost of your health care, but lost wages, replacement services, and the value of lost wages and replacement services for the rest of your life based on the injury you\\'ve suffered. \\n   And it allows for pain and suffering up to $250,000 or three times economic loss whichever is greater. It has pain and suffering but with a limit on it. \\n   Another good example of our success in finding a sensible middle ground comes in the form of our plan\\'s consumer information section, on which I have worked. Both the Democratic and Republican bills provide beneficiaries with information about coverage, cost sharing, out-of-network care, formularies, grievance and appeals procedures. One area of sharp difference is health plan performance. The Republican bill does not include any requirement that the performance of the plan, its doctors, and hospitals in preventing illness and saving lives be reported. \\n   Our bipartisan alternative requires provider performance report cards because we believe this is critical information for consumers to have in deciding which managed care plan to choose. We also reached back to an earlier bipartisan bill I sponsored with Senator JEFFORDS to include waivers and other language to ease the difficulty of administration for HMOs, PPOs, and providers. \\n   The bottom line here is that patients rights don\\'t have to lead to political fights. There is a path to dependable consumer protections that does not require detours to bash HMOs or our colleagues. We have pled with our leadership to give us the opportunity to offer our alternative as an amendment today and prove our case. \\n   If not, I am prepared, and I believe our coalition is as well, to offer this proposal as an amendment to another legislative vehicle in the Senate this session. The American people deserve more from this critically important debate than high-glossed veto bait. We must show them that we take their concerns and our responsibilities seriously, and pass a law that will in fact improve the quality of health care for millions of American families. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-2-19990715\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Florida. \\n   It has been a spirited debate. We must acknowledge there have been impressive displays of party unity on both sides, but to what end? The end of the sound and fury is we will produce a bill we know the President will veto, and therefore there will be nothing done to help the American people with the problems they have with health care. \\n   It didn\\'t have to be that way. There was a third way. There was a third way that would have recognized and expressed something else the debate has concealed: The fact that across party lines we agree on about 70 percent of the topics we talked about. It was the aim of our bipartisan group to put that majority round of agreements on the bill. Unfortunately, we didn\\'t have an opportunity to have it heard by our colleagues in this debate. \\n   We will be back. We are going to submit our proposals and there will be another day. \\n   I yield the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990714\\n\\n    Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, our society is suffering from the deterioration of the married, two-parent family. According to a recent report by the National Marriage Project at Rutgers, ``The State of Our Unions: The Social Health of Marriage in America,\\'\\' marriage rates are at a 40-year low and there are fewer social forces holding them together. As the number of marriages has declined, unwed births have dramatically grown. Unfortunately, the result is more and more children are being born into fragile families. \\n   As the report states, ``Marriage is a fundamental social institution ..... It is the `social glue\\' that reliably attaches fathers to children.\\'\\' Nearly 25 million children, more than 1 out of 3, live absent their biological father, and 17 million kids live without a father of any kind. Even more troubling, about 40 percent of the children living in fatherless households have not seen their fathers in at least a year, and 50 percent of children who do not live with their fathers have never stepped foot in their father\\'s home. \\n   This growing problem of father absence is taking a terrible toll on those children, who are being denied the love, guidance, discipline, emotional nourishment and financial support that fathers usually provide. \\n   Parents act as a nurturing and stable foundation for children. They are a guiding force to which children readily open their arms. In a recent poll conducted by Nickelodeon and Time magazine, three-quarters of the children, ages six to 14, polled stated that they wished they could spend more time with their parents. In addition, kids consistently ranked parents at the very top of the list when asked to name the people they look up to. \\n   More than friends or teachers, parents shape their children\\'s value systems. As dads disappear, the American family is becoming significantly weaker, as are the values we depend on families to transmit. In turn, the risks to the health and well-being of children are becoming significantly higher. Social science research repeatedly shows that children growing up without fathers are far more likely to live in poverty, to fail in school, experience behavioral and emotional problems, develop drug and alcohol problems, commit suicide, and experience physical abuse and neglect. \\n   We have seen the devastating results of this breakdown in our culture as the number of violent incidences among young males, in particular, rises. Statistics reveal that violent criminals are overwhelmingly males who grew up without fathers. \\n   Concerned citizens and grass-roots groups are paying attention to the statistics, and they are actively seeking solutions neighborhood by neighborhood across the nation. A shining example of this united effort is the National Fatherhood Initiative (NFI) which was formed to help raise awareness of the problem of father absence and its consequences and to mobilize a national response to it. To date, the NFI has made tremendous progress, working in communities across the country to set up educational programs and promote responsible fatherhood. \\n   There are limits to what we in government and here in Congress can do to change society\\'s attitudes toward marriage and out-of-wedlock births, but we are not powerless. I am proud to sign on to the proposal introduced by my colleagues Senators EVAN BAYH and PETE DOMENICI, ``The Resppnsible Fatherhood Act of 1999,\\'\\' that will help strengthen fragile families and promote responsible fatherhood, as well as promote the formation and maintenance of married, two-parent families. \\n   I would like to highlight a few key provisions that will significantly increase efforts at the state and local level to reconnect fathers and families, thereby ensuring a brighter, more secure future for our youth. \\n   Unfortunately, few television shows and movies produced today highlight the value of marriage. Cohabitation and out-of-wedlock sex are handled so casually that young people see little incentive for marriage. This bipartisan legislation authorizes a challenge grant to encourage states and local communities to initiate media campaigns that promote responsible fatherhood and the importance of a married, two-parent family in a child\\'s life. Rather than the typical barrage of negative images, young people need to see positive messages on fatherhood and marriage. \\n   States, localities and community organizations are already helping lead the fight at the local level for responsible fatherhood. Their efforts must be bolstered, not hindered. This proposal authorizes a Responsible Parenting Block Grant to provide support for state and local government, nonprofit, charitable and religious organizations\\' efforts. \\n   No one solution exists that will reconnect fathers and families, but a combined effort can make a difference. That is why a national clearinghouse would be established to facilitate the exchange of ideas and sharing of success stories. Such a clearinghouse also would produce and distribute resources to aid those leading the charge at the community level. The National Fatherhood Initiative has been highlighted as an exemplary group to house such a clearinghouse. \\n   Although many fathers desire to make a financial contribution to their family, they are unable to because they lack the necessary skills to obtain jobs. In 1997, Congress passed Welfare to Work legislation to help the hardest-to-employ welfare recipients and low-income, non-custodial parents move into jobs. Unfortunately, many states have not been able to use their full funding because of restrictive federal guidelines. The Responsible Fatherhood Act will provide states and cities the flexibility they need to serve a broader group of low-income, non-custodial fathers, and provide services to increase the employment and parenting skills of eligible fathers. \\n   Under the current system, fathers with children on welfare are discouraged from paying child support as payments are instead typically shifted to state agencies to offset welfare benefits. Research demonstrates that fathers are more connected with their children and more likely to pay child support when they believe their payment is going directly to their family, and not the government. Children on welfare are precisely the children who have been identified as group most in need of father involvement, and we should eliminate any barriers that prevent this critical bond from taking place. Therefore, this legislation would establish the federal government as a partner to states that want to exercise an option to pass-through up to $75 of child support payments per month directly to the family without impacting welfare eligibility. \\n   Implementing new innovative fatherhood initiatives should not be a rigorous, burdensome process. States should have the flexibility to use child-support funds on programs that support and promote fatherhood instead of paying funds back to TANF. Getting fathers back to work and reconnected to their families will do more to move families off of welfare permanently. \\n   The Responsible Fatherhood Act of 1999, I believe, marks a major turning point in the politics of the family as is evidenced by the solid bipartisan consensus coalescing behind this proposal. Promoting responsible fatherhood does not take away from the efforts of single mothers, but helps ensure that children receive the benefits provided by two caring parents. Addressing the critical role fathers play in the lives of their children is no longer a politically taboo topic. The research is convincing and, unfortunately, mounting every year--children need the support and involvement of both parents to lead happy, healthy, productive lives. \\n   I thank Senators BAYH and DOMENICI for leading this effort. I am proud to join them as a cosponsor. \\n   By Mr. MURKOWSKI (by request): \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-2-19990714\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join with my distinguished colleague from Vermont to introduce the Clean Energy Act of 1999. This landmark legislation provides a comprehensive, long-term blueprint for fulfilling the promise of fishable rivers, swimable streams, and clean, breathable air as envisioned by the ground-breaking Clean Water and Clean Air Acts. \\n   As Senator JEFFORDS has explained, the Clean Energy Act would reduce emissions of the full range of pollutants that damage human health and the global environment. The public health standards embodied in this bill are ambitious. But they reflect the significant strides Northeastern utilities have made in recent years to reduce pollution from electric power plants. They also reflect the reality that goals can, and must, be achieved regionally and nationally if we are to ensure clean air and clean water for every community. \\n   As utilities invest in control technologies to help them meet existing and future clean air requirements, they face difficult choices. Some technologies control for one pollutant, while exacerbating emissions of another and often utilities make large capital investments without knowing what pollutant reductions may be required of them in the future. The Clean Energy Act will bring order to the equation by providing a comprehensive but flexible guide for controlling the full range of pollutants associated with electricity generation, including nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide, mercury, and carbon. \\n   The Clean Energy Act will help reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides that lead to smog that makes it difficult for children, asthmatics, and the elderly to breathe. It will help reduce acid rain by reducing the amount of sulphur that our smokestacks pump into the air. \\n   The bill will accelerate efforts to make the fish in rivers safe to eat by lowering the amount of mercury introduced into the food chain. And it will help reduce the U.S. contribution to the problem of climate change by recognizing carbon dioxide as a pollutant of the global atmosphere. \\n   Last year, I introduced a bill designed to close a loophole in the Clean Air Act that exempts older power plants from rigorous environmental standards. We know that to ensure fairness in an era of increasing competitiveness, we must strengthen pollution controls so that dirty power plants don\\'t gain an unfair share of the market while polluting at higher rates than cleaner, more efficient utilities. The Clean Energy Act builds on the effort begun last year, by requiring all plants, no matter what their vintage, to meet the same standards. \\n   Electricity deregulation carries the promise of enormous benefits for the consumer--mainly in reduced electric bills--which I strongly support. But electricity deregulation can also cause adverse environmental and public health consequences if we don\\'t do it right. \\n   The principles behind the Clean Energy Act--comprehensive control of pollutants and equitable across-the-board standards, enhanced by emissions trading--provide a vision for how the electricity industry and our economy can grow even as we improve the quality of our air and water for generations to come.  \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990713\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the Robb-Murray amendment, which provides our mothers, wives, daughters and sisters with direct access to OB/GYN care and strengthens the ability of a woman and her doctor to make personal medical decisions. \\n   The sponsors of this amendment, along with most women and most Americans, believe that a woman should have the choice and the freedom to select an OB/GYN physician as her primary care provider and to determine, in consultation with her doctor, how long she should stay in the hospital following surgery. \\n   Those critical and deeply personal judgments should not be trumped by the arbitrary guidelines of managed care companies. The women in our lives deserve better than drive-by mastectomies. With the Robb-Murray amendment, we will say so in law, and ensure that women receive the services they need and the respect they are owed. \\n   Studies show that when women have a primary care physician trained in OB/GYN, they receive more comprehensive care and greater personal satisfaction when they are treated by doctors trained in other specialties. \\n   We should consider, too, that breast cancer is the second leading killer of women in this country. New cases of this disease occur more than twice as often as second most common type of cancer, lung cancer. More than 178,000 women in this country were diagnosed with breast cancer in 1998. I have no doubt we will someday find the origin and cure for this terrible malady. Until then, though, we have a duty to make the system charged with treating these women respectful and responsive to their needs. \\n   Sadly, the evidence suggests we have a long way to go. We continue to receive disturbing reports about the insistence of some insurance companies to force women out of the hospital immediately after physically demanding and emotionally traumatic surgeries. We have been shocked by stories of women being sent home with drainage tubes still in their bodies and groggy from general anesthesia. This is distressing to me not just as a policy-maker, but as a son, father, and husband. \\n   Now, some critics of the Robb-Murray Amendment want to sidestep this problem, and suggest that we are legislating by body part. To that, I say: \\n   Those who oppose this provision are wasting a valuable opportunity to increase the quality of physical health care for over half the population of the United States. \\n   Those who oppose are ignoring the suffering and inconvenience of women throughout this country trying to receive the basic health care that they have every right to expect. \\n   Those who oppose are failing to right a wrong that we have tolerated for too long.  \\n   Mr. President, women are being denied the quality of care they are paying for and to which they have a moral right. And this Senate has a chance today to begin fixing this inequity. I urge my colleagues to look beyond the rhetoric and see the very simple and fair logic that calls for the passage of this amendment, and join us in supporting it. \\n   Several Senators addressed the Chair. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990712\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of Senator LUGAR and myself to note the passing of another milestone for former President George Bush, a man the State of Connecticut considers a native son. President Bush recently celebrated his 75th birthday in his typically exuberant fashion, by jumping out of an airplane, just as he did on his 70th birthday. \\n   After such a long and distinguished career of public service--which started in the South Pacific, where he put his life on the line for the cause of freedom, and which culminated in the Persian Gulf, where he put his Presidency on the line to stand up to the brutal aggression of Saddam Hussein--it\\'s hard for some to believe that President Bush would have the interest, let alone the energy, to pursue his sky-diving habit as a septuagenarian. \\n   But no one has ever accused the man who assembled and led the Gulf War coalition to victory of taking the easy way out. And today, much as we have grown to appreciate the fortitude and unobtrusive dignity he brought to the Presidency, so too can we admire the vitality and vigor he has brought to his life outside the Oval Office. He has shown himself to be a man for all seasons, not to mention all altitudes. \\n   Those estimable characteristics were vividly captured in a profile recently penned by White House correspondent Trude B. Feldman to commemorate President\\'s Bush\\'s birthday. To pay tribute to President Bush on the passing of this important milestone, and in the spirit of bipartisanship, I would join with Senator LUGAR in asking unanimous consent to print the full text of Ms. Feldman\\'s article in the RECORD. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990701\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concerns about S. 376, the international satellite reform legislation. While I commend my colleagues who have worked hard on this very important issue, I am concerned that there is still more work to do to ensure reform that results in a truly competitive market. \\n   Comprehensive satellite reform is long overdue. The 1962 Communications Satellite Act is based on a 1960s  era notion that telecommunications services must be provided by national or international monopolies. This thinking gave rise to two treaty organizations, INTELSAT and Inmarsat, to provide international satellite communications services. Comsat, a private company, was created by Congress in 1962 and has been the U.S. representative--known as the Signatory--to these intergovernmental organizations. Today, we know that technology and the marketplace demand that this monopoly, governmental model must give way to private competition. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990629\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend and colleague from New York. I thank Senator LOTT for agreeing to set aside this time this morning to honor the memory of Rabbi Moshe Sherer. I thank Senator MOYNIHAN for providing the dignity that is always his but the intimacy that reflects the relationship he had with Rabbi Moshe Sherer. I thank my friend and college classmate from Missouri who just spoke so impressively about this extraordinary man. \\n   I am honored to have known Rabbi Moshe Sherer, a blessed memory. I met him after I became a Senator and benefited, as anyone did, from the opportunity to be in his presence, from his wisdom, insights--insights not just on matters of faith but on matters of the broader community. \\n   This was a man of extraordinary personal dignity and discipline, of hard work and of very good humor. He was a pleasure to be with. \\n   The life we celebrate today was a most extraordinary and consequential life, based on values that go back thousands of years, motivated by a single overriding towering motivation to honor God\\'s name, to perform acts of Kiddish Hashem, the sanctification of God\\'s name. That is to say, to do good works, to be true to the values that are set down in the Bible, in the Ten Commandments, in the broadly held ethical system that we call the Judeo-Christian tradition. \\n   Rabbi Moshe Sherer did that, magnificently rising to become, as we end this century, clearly one of the great leaders of the Orthodox Jewish community in America in this century, one of the great leaders of any faith-based community in America during this century. \\n   Those who have spoken before me have spoken of the extraordinary record of service and growth that Rabbi Sherer gave. I spoke to him several times about his involvement in 1943 when he was asked to take a position at this organization, Agudath of Israel. He spoke to friends and they told him he would be foolish to even consider it. This was an organization that had little credibility, few members. In fact, it was at a time when even within the American Jewish community there were predictions that the  Orthodox community would not go with much vibrancy into the future. Somebody actually referred to the Orthodox community generally as a ``sickly weed.\\'\\' The resilience and feistiness of this man and his commitment to the values that were the foundation of his faith propelled him in the face of those pieces of wise counsel to go forward and prove them wrong. \\n   And did he ever do that, devoting the rest of his life to this organization, particularly in the context of the end of the Second World War, and the great suffering that occurred to so many suffering Jews in Europe during the war--watching the growth of this organization as a reaction, a kind of affirmation of faith and life after the temporary victories of death and antifaith, if I can put it that way, and anti-God certainly during the Second World War. \\n   This organization rose out of that experience, and enjoyed the extraordinary, unprecedented liberty that America provided to this community, becoming the great, strong organization it is today. It is as Rabbi Sherer passed away with thousands of members in this country and all over the world in an extraordinary array of religious, social service, and communal activities. It is a remarkable program of study. \\n   I don\\'t know if anyone else has spoken of what is called the ``daf yomi\\'\\' program, a page-a-day of Talmud study done under the auspices of Agudath Israel. It takes 7 1/2 years to finish the Talmud--a compilation of Jewish literature attempting to interpret the values and the specifics of the Torah, the Bible. On the last completion of that cycle, which occurred in September of 1997, if I am correct, 70,000 people gathered, filling Madison Square Garden in New York, Chaplain Ogilvie. It reminds me in some sense of the Promise Keepers or groups of other faiths coming together to do some of the work you have done with Reverend Graham, and others--70,000 people, first filling Madison Square Garden, and then in the halls and chambers all over America and all over the world on one night to celebrate what is called the A Siyum, the completion of the 7 1/2 year day-by-day trek through this experience, a remarkable achievement, and a commitment to live by the values that were part of that organization and that experience. \\n   Rabbi Sherer, it has probably been said here--and I will say it briefly--not only built the inner strength of the American Orthodox Jewish community through study, through social service, through communal strength, but was a remarkable ambassador to the broader community of faith-based organizations working with people of other faiths, and then reaching out into the community, and particularly the political community during his time in recent years. He opened an office here in Washington, a kind of government relations office for the good of Israel--working again with other groups to support across religious lines commonly held principles, even when they were controversial. \\n   On the day that Rabbi Sherer was buried and his funeral occurred, there was a remarkable outpouring in New York to pay tribute to him. More than 20,000 people stood outside the synagogue where the service was held. They lined the streets to pay final honor to Rabbi Moshe Sherer. It was heartfelt, it was emotional, and it was also an expression of gratitude to all he had meant to the organization, to them personally, to their children, to the institutions from which they had benefited, and to their sense of freedom and confidence being religious people in the America context. And now, as we are taught the way to continue to honor his memory is to live by the principles that guided his own life, we are taught that when a person dies and leaves this Earth and their soul ascends to heaven that they are in that sense unable to do more to elevate themselves, that it is up to those of us who survive them here on Earth to try to do deeds that are good in their name, if you will, to be of support and strength to them. \\n   I think that is the work that has continued in the organization and in the lives of the individuals and all of us who were touched by Rabbi Moshe Sherer. \\n   I join my colleagues to pay tribute to him, and to those who continue the strong and important work for the good of Israel, and to offer condolences to his wife, to his children, to his grandchildren, and to his great grandchildren. \\n   May God come forth and give them the strength--as I know He will--to carry on the extraordinary good work that characterizes the life and times of a great Jewish American, Rabbi Moshe Sherer. \\n   I thank the Chair. \\n   I yield the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990629\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair and thank my friend and colleague from Pennsylvania. \\n   Mr. President, I am very pleased to be joining today with my friends and colleagues, Senators SPECTER, LEVIN, and COLLINS, in introducing the Independent Counsel Reform Act of 1999. With this bill, we hope to convince our colleagues, disillusioned perhaps by the conduct of particular investigations, that the Independent Counsel statute serves an essential purpose, and has served us well over the past twenty years. We want to convince our colleagues that our legislation will preserve the essential ideals that motivated the enactment of this statute in the years after Watergate, that no person is above the law, and that our highest government officials must be subject to our laws in the same way as any other person. If they are guilty, they must be held accountable. If they are not, they must be cleared. The American people are more likely to trust the findings of an Independent Counsel\\'s investigation and conclusions. Officials who are wrongly accused will receive vindication that is far more credible to the public than when it comes from the Department of Justice. As a result, the public\\'s confidence in its government is enhanced by the Independent Counsel statute. \\n   We have drafted new provisions that will curb the excesses we have seen in a few recent investigations. These changes are substantial. The Committee on Governmental Affairs held five hearings on the Independent Counsel statute. We heard from numerous witnesses who had served as Independent Counsel, and as Attorney General, from former prosecutors and from defense attorneys. Many witnesses supported the statute, even defense attorneys who had represented targets in Independent Counsel investigations. Both witnesses who opposed the statute outright, and those who advocated keeping it in some form, suggested a number of improvements to the statute. We carefully considered those recommendations before we sat down to draft a bill that retains the essential features of the old law while reducing its scope, limiting the powers of the Independent Counsel, and bringing greater transparency into the process.  \\n   As a result of our bill, there will be far fewer Independent Counsel appointed, they will be appointed only to investigate the highest government officials, and their actions will be constrained by the same sorts of guidelines and practical restraints that govern regular federal prosecutors. \\n   For example, officials covered by the statute will be limited to the President, the Vice President, the President\\'s Chief of Staff, and Cabinet members. This is a major reduction in the number of officials currently covered by the Independent Counsel statute. We can trust the Department of Justice to investigate the mid-level officials listed in previous versions of the statute. If any other investigation raises a conflict of interest, the Attorney General retains the authority to appoint her own Special Counsel. The purpose of our bill is to reserve the extraordinary mechanism of a court-appointed Independent Counsel for those rare cases involving allegations against our highest Executive Branch officials. \\n   In another change that will reduce the number of Independent Counsel appointed, the threshold for seeking the appointment of an Independent Counsel will be raised, so that a greater amount of evidence to back up the allegation will be required. The Attorney General will also be entitled for the first time to issue subpoenas for evidence and convene grand juries during the preliminary investigation, and would be given more time to conduct the preliminary investigation. This change responds to concerns that, in the past, the Attorney General\\'s hands have been tied during the preliminary investigation stage. With our bill, the Department of Justice will be able to conduct a more substantial preliminary investigation. \\n   Each Independent Counsel will have to devote his full time to the position for the duration of his tenure. This will prevent the appearance of conflicts that may arise when an Independent Counsel continues with his private legal practice, and it will expedite investigations as well. The Independent Counsel will also be expected to conform his conduct to the written guidelines and established policies of the Department of Justice. The prior version of that requirement contained a broad loophole, which has been eliminated. \\n   There have been many complaints about runaway prosecutors, who continue their investigations longer than is necessary or appropriate. Our bill will impose a time limit of two years on investigations by Independent Counsel. The Special Division of the Court of Appeals will be able to grant extensions of time, however, for good cause and to compensate for dilatory tactics by opposing counsel. Imposing a flexible time limit allows Independent Counsel the time they genuinely need to complete their investigations, and deters adverse counsel from using the time limit strategically to escape justice. But the time limit will also encourage future Independent Counsel to bring their investigations to an expeditious conclusion, and not chase down every imaginable lead. \\n   Our bill makes another important change that will prevent expansion of investigations into unrelated areas. Until now the statute has allowed the Attorney General to request an expansion of an Independent Counsel\\'s prosecutorial jurisdiction into unrelated areas. This happened several times with Judge Starr\\'s investigation, and I believe those expansions contributed to a perception that the prosecutor was pursuing the man and not the crime. An Independent Counsel must not exist to pursue every possible lead against his target until he finds some taint of criminality. His function, our bill makes clear, is to investigate that subject matter given him in his original grant of prosecutorial jurisdiction. \\n   We also considered how we might impose greater budgetary restraints on Independent Counsel. Some have spoken of the need for a strict budget cap, but this idea strikes me as impractical, if not unworkable. It\\'s just impossible to know in advance what crimes a prosecutor will uncover, how far his investigation will have to go to get to the truth, how expensive a trial and any appeals will be. Instead, we are bringing greater budgetary transparency to the process by directing Independent Counsel to produce an estimated budget for each year, and by allowing the General Accounting Office to comment on that budget. At the moment not enough is known about how Independent Counsel spend their money, and this greater transparency will provide more incentive for Counsel to budget responsibly. \\n   A final change that we all readily agreed to was to eliminate entirely the requirement that an Independent Counsel refer evidence of impeachable offenses to the House of Representatives. The impeachment power is one of Congress\\'s essential Constitutional functions, and no part of that role should be delegated by statute to a prosecutor. \\n   This bill should be thought of as a work in progress. We hope to gather input from other Members and from outside experts, and to have committee hearings, and we intend to be flexible about incorporating suggestions. Some of the provisions contained in the bill may raise constitutional concerns, which need to be fully explored. For example, giving the Special Division of the Court of Appeals new authority to decide whether an Independent Counsel has violated Department of Justice guidelines may violate the doctrine of Separation of Powers. Other provisions expanding the Court\\'s role may also have to be reformulated. I hope that all interested parties will be able to work together on amendments as harmoniously as the four of us did in drafting the original legislation. \\n   The occasion of our introducing this legislation is tomorrow\\'s expiration of the current Independent Counsel statute. Many have dismissed any efforts to revive the Independent Counsel as wrong and futile. No doubt it will be an uphill struggle, and I do not expect peoples\\' minds to be changed overnight. But I do believe that over time several factors will work to change peoples\\' minds. \\n   First, I feel confident that we can convince our colleagues that this legislation is a better product than previous versions of the statute, and addresses the specific concerns raised by the law\\'s opponents. Those who have predicted the death of the Independent Counsel statute had not seen our legislation. I will work tirelessly, with the bill\\'s other co-sponsors, to convince our colleagues to give this issue a fresh look. \\n   Secondly, several controversial Independent Counsel investigations have clearly soured some people on the law. This is understandable, but it is regrettable, as I do not believe these investigations revealed any flaws in the Independent Counsel statute that cannot be fixed. The passions raised by Judge Starr\\'s investigation of the President, in particular, must be allowed to subside, just as it took some time for the passions inspired by the Iran-Contra investigation to subside before the Independent Counsel statute could be re-authorized in 1994. \\n   Finally, as these passions subside I believe Members of Congress will gradually be reminded that the Independent Counsel statute embodies certain principles fundamental to our democracy. The alternative to an Independent Counsel statute is a system in which the Attorney General must decide how to handle substantive allegations against colleagues in the Cabinet, or against the President. Often the President and the Attorney General are long-time friends and political allies. The Attorney General will not be trusted by some to ensure that an unbiased investigation will be conducted. In other cases, many will question the thoroughness of an investigation directed from inside the Department. In a time of great public cynicism about government, the Independent Counsel statute guarantees that even the President and his highest officials will have to answer for their criminal malfeasance. In that sense, this statute upholds the rule of law and will help stem the rising tide of cynicism and distrust toward our government. The American people support the Independent Counsel statute because it embodies the bedrock American principle that no person is above the law. \\n   Mr. President, I am very pleased to be joining today Senator SPECTER, Senator LEVIN and Senator COLLINS in introducing the Independent Counsel Reform Act of 1999. It has been a great pleasure working with these three colleagues across party lines in what were, first, long hearings in the Governmental Affairs Committee on which we all serve, and then some very good  collegial discussions about how to preserve the principles involved in the Independent Counsel Act while responding to what we have learned, particularly in its recent existence and implementation. We have achieved a good balance. \\n   The point to stress--and my friend and colleague from Pennsylvania has just done it--is this is all about the rule of law which is at the heart of what the American experience is about, that no one is above the law. There is no monarchy, there is no autocracy. Everyone is supposed to be governed by the same law. \\n   The question is, When the highest officials of our Government, the most powerful people in this land are suspected of criminal wrongdoing, is it appropriate to have those suspicions investigated by the people who are suspected themselves or by those whom they have appointed? Does that guarantee a thorough and independent investigation, and does it guarantee or at least encourage the kinds of broad-based public acceptance of the credibility of that investigation that is critical to the trust and respect that we hope the American people will have for their Government? \\n   The four of us have answered that what is required is a counsel who is not just special, as others would provide, including the current Attorney General, but one that is genuinely independent, not appointed by the Attorney General, and not able to be fired, dismissed by the Attorney General. \\n   My research has indicated that from the last century right through the Nixon administration, from President Ulysses Grant to President Richard Nixon, there were actually six special counsel appointed to investigate possible criminal behavior by high officials of the Government, and three of those were dismissed by the administration they served, presumably because they began to act in a way that unsettled that administration. \\n   That is the principle of the rule of law, trust in Government, which we tried to embody in this proposal with the changes that Senator SPECTER has mentioned. We have added a presumption of a limited term, a higher threshold for the appointment of an independent counsel, a smaller number of people to be subject to this statute--the President, Vice President, Attorney General, Members of the Cabinet and the Chief of Staff. \\n   The prevailing consensus in this body and the other body is that we should not renew this statute and it will, of course, expire tomorrow. Many have dismissed the efforts we are making now as either wrong or futile. No doubt it will be an uphill struggle, but I am convinced it is the right struggle, and we can convince our colleagues of the justness of our cause. \\n   I will say something else, Mr. President. There will be an independent counsel statute in the future. We are either going to adopt it at a time when we are not in crisis, when somebody high up in our Government is suspected of criminal wrongdoing--and that is our hope, that we do not adopt it in the spirit of crisis, or we will adopt it at that time when someone is suspected of criminal wrongdoing and Members of this body and the other body will demand there not be a special counsel appointed by the Attorney General but an independent counsel. \\n   I plead with my colleagues, as the law is allowed to expire tomorrow and as, hopefully, we have a cooling off period, to take a look at our proposal, to try to separate ourselves from the controversies surrounding Judge Starr\\'s time as independent counsel and that of other recent independent counsel, and focus on the principle of the rule of law, that nobody is above the law in America, and to come to agree with us that the best way to preserve those principles is by readopting an Independent Counsel Act, one \\n   that is substantially reformed. \\n   I thank my colleagues, and I yield the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990624\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am delighted to join with Senators JEFFORDS, KENNEDY and over 30 of our colleagues as an original cosponsor of this important legislation, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 1999. By guaranteeing that American workers cannot lose their jobs simply because of their sexual orientation, this bill would extend the bedrock American values of fairness and equality to a group of our fellow citizens who too often have been denied the benefit of those most basic values. \\n   Our nation\\'s foundational document, the Declaration of Independence, expressed a vision of our country as one premised upon the essential equality of all people and upon the recognition that our Creator endowed all of us with the inalienable rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Two hundred and twenty-three years ago, when that document was drafted, our laws fell far short of implementing the Declaration\\'s ideal. But since that time, we have come ever closer, extending by law to more and more of our citizens--to African Americans, to women, to disabled Americans, to religious minorities and to others--a legally enforceable guarantee that, with respect to their ability to earn a living at least, they will be treated on their merits and not on characteristics unrelated to their ability to do their jobs. \\n   It is time to extend that guarantee to gay men and lesbians, who too often have been subject to incidents of discrimination and denied the most basic of rights: the right to obtain and maintain a job. A collection of one national survey and twenty city and state surveys found that as many as 44 percent of gay, lesbian and bisexual workers faced job discrimination in the workplace at some time in their careers. Other studies have reported even greater discrimination--as much as 68 percent of gay men and lesbians reporting employment discrimination. The fear in which these workers live was clear from a survey of gay men and lesbians in Philadelphia. Over three-quarters told those conducting the survey that they sometimes or always hide their orientation at work out of fear of discrimination. \\n   The toll this discrimination takes extends far beyond its effect on those individuals who must live in fear and without full employment opportunities. It also takes an unacceptable toll on America\\'s definition of itself as a land of equality and opportunity, as a place where we judge each other on our merits, and as a country that teaches its children that anyone can succeed here as long as they are willing to do their job and work hard. \\n   This bill provides for equality and fairness--that and no more. It says only what we already have said for women, for people of color and for others: that you are entitled to have your ability to earn a living depend only on your ability to do the job and nothing else. In fact, the bill would even do somewhat less than it does for women and people of color, because it would not give gay men and women all of the protections we currently provide to other groups protected under our civil rights laws. \\n   Mr. President, this bill would bring our nation one large step closer to realizing the vision that Thomas Jefferson so eloquently expressed 223 years ago when he wrote that all of us have a right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990621\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to join my distinguished colleague from New Jersey, Senator TORRICELLI, and my colleague from Connecticut, Senator DODD, to introduce legislation that would amend title 4 of the United States Code to prohibit the imposition of discriminatory commuter taxes by political subdivisions of States. \\n   On May 26, 1999, New York Governor George Pataki signed into law a repeal  of the commuter tax for people who work in New York City but live outside of the five boroughs. This repeal only applies to residents of New York state; it does not include the 330,000 people from New Jersey and Connecticut who work in New York City. \\n   In 1966, Governor Nelson Rockefeller and Mayor John Lindsay initiated the commuter tax. To the present day, New York City has enforced the 0.45% tax on commuters\\' income much like a payroll tax. Estimates show that this tax generates $360 million a year in revenue that helps to supports services such as police and fire protection and emergency medical care. New York state residents contribute $210 million a year in commuter tax revenue, while New Jersey and Connecticut residents account for the remaining $150 million in tax revenue. The commuter tax repeal eliminates more than $200 million from New York City\\'s annual tax revenue. \\n   New York State\\'s unilateral, partial repeal of the commuter tax only for its residents is an unfortunate development after 33 years of assessing the tax on all commuters who work in New York City. This is an unprecedented action on the part of a legislative body and state executive to repeal a tax on its residents but maintain it for non-residents. The imposition of taxes only on out-of-state commuters could violate the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. Limited repeal discriminates against out-of-state commuters and inhibits interstate commerce and travel. \\n   Approximately 86,000 of my constituents work in New York City, contributing an estimated $100 million in commuter tax revenue; 244,000 New Jersey constituents account for an estimated $50 million in tax revenue that goes to New York City. According to Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, the taxable income of Connecticut commuters is lower than non-commuters because of this tax that commuters pay to New York. The commuter tax essentially draws away millions of dollars in tax revenue from Connecticut and gives them to New York City to subsidize services and other public works. \\n   This Connecticut and New Jersey subsidy to New York City is unacceptable. If a commuter tax is imposed all commuters--whether they are from Newark, New Rochelle, or New Haven--are equally responsible to bear it. There is no reason that our commuter constituents should be paying for New York City services while New York state residents are not. \\n   Senator TORRICELLI and I are joined by others who have taken action to force a repeal of the law passed by the New York state legislature. Two attorneys, Richard Swanson and Thomas Igoe, filed a complaint in Manhattan Supreme Court that seeks class-action status for other commuters from New Jersey and Connecticut. Swanson from New Jersey and Igoe from Connecticut are colleagues at the Manhattan law firm of Thelen, Reid & Priest. Moreover, Governor Rowland of Connecticut and Governor Whitman of New Jersey plan to challenge the constitutionality of the commuter tax repeal bill in federal courts. New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani also intends to file a lawsuit against the state, although his claim stands on different grounds than the ones brought forth by Governors Whitman and Rowland. \\n   The partial commuter tax repeal bill that Governor Pataki signed includes a provision that says that the tax will be repealed for all commuters if a partial repeal is found unconstitutional in federal courts. Even if the lawsuits succeed in their legal challenges, we still need legislation that will prevent state governments from discriminating against nonresidents and imposing unfair commuter taxes in the future. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990617\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend from New Jersey. I have access to the time allotted to the Senator from New Hampshire. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-2-19990617\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. If it fits the Senator\\'s schedule. I don\\'t expect to take but 10 minutes. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990617\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, for most of us, Father\\'s Day, which of course is this coming Sunday, is a special day of love, family, appreciation, a customary time for giving ties and, if you will allow me, for renewing ties of a different sort. But for a staggering number of American children, there will be no ties of either kind to celebrate this Sunday. The sad reality is that an estimated 25 million children--more than 1 out of 3--live absent their biological father, and 17 million kids live without a father of any kind. About 40 percent of the children living in fatherless households have not seen their dads in at least a year; and 50 percent of children who don\\'t live with their fathers have never stepped foot in their father\\'s home. \\n   This growing crisis of father absence in America is taking a terrible toll on these children who are being denied the love, guidance, discipline, emotional nourishment, and daily support that fathers can provide. As dads disappear, the American family is becoming significantly weaker and less capable of fulfilling its fundamental responsibility of nurturing and socializing children and conveying values to them. In turn, the risks to the health and well-being of America\\'s children are becoming significantly higher. \\n   Children growing up without fathers, research shows, are far more likely to live in poverty, to fail in school, to experience behavioral and emotional problems, to develop drug and alcohol problems, to be victims of physical abuse and neglect and, tragically, to commit suicide. It is, of course, not just those children individually who are suffering but our society as a whole. Many mothers and fathers are so busy today that they are less involved in their children\\'s lives than in the past. But this absence is particularly consequential when it comes to fathers, for they play such a critical role in socializing and providing boundaries to children, particularly to boys. \\n   The devastating consequences of father absence for communities--and particularly urban communities--has been broadly documented in a report released just this week by the Institute For American Values and the Morehouse Research Institute. The report was titled ``Turning the Corner on Father Absence in Black America.\\'\\' It was discussed in a powerful column by Michael Kelly, which appeared in Wednesday\\'s Washington Post. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-2-19990617\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I want to say just a few words on the jarring statistics from that report and column for my colleagues. Of African American children born in 1996, 70 percent were born to unmarried mothers. At least 80 percent, according to the report, can expect to spend a significant part of their childhood apart from their fathers. \\n   We can take some comfort and encouragement from the fact that the teen pregnancy rate has dropped in the last few years. But the numbers cited in Mr. Kelly\\'s column and in the report are nonetheless profoundly unsettling, especially given what we know about the impact of fatherlessness, and indicate we are in the midst of what Kelly aptly terms a ``national calamity.\\'\\' It is a calamity. Of course, it is not limited to the African American community. On any given night, 4 out of 10 children in this country are sleeping in homes without fathers. \\n   At the end of this column, Michael Kelly asks: How could this happen in a Nation like ours? And he wonders if anyone is paying attention. \\n   Well, the fact is that people are beginning to pay attention, although it tends to be more people at the grassroots level who are actively seeking solutions neighborhood by neighborhood. The best known of these groups is called the National Fatherhood Initiative. I think it has made tremendous progress in recent years in raising awareness of father absence and its impact on our society and in mobilizing a national effort to promote responsible fatherhood. \\n   Along with a group of allies, the National Fatherhood Initiative has been establishing educational programs in hundreds of cities and towns across America. It has pulled together bipartisan task forces in the Senate, the House, and among the Nation\\'s Governors and mayors. It has worked with us to explore public policies that encourage and support the efforts of fathers to become more involved in the lives of their children. \\n   Last Monday, the National Fatherhood Initiative held its annual national fatherhood summit here in Washington. At that summit, Gen. Colin Powell, and an impressive and wide-ranging group of experts and advocates, talked in depth about the father absence crisis in our cities and towns and brainstormed about what we can do to turn this troubling situation around. \\n   There are limits to what we in Government can do to meet this challenge and advance the cause of responsible fatherhood because, after all, it is hard to change people\\'s attitudes and behaviors and values through legislation. But that doesn\\'t mean we are powerless, nor does it mean we can afford not to try to lessen the impact of a problem that is literally eating away at our country. \\n   In recent times, we have had a great commonality of concern expressed in the ideological breadth of the fatherhood promotion effort both here in the Senate and our task force, but underscored by statements that the President, the Vice President, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services have made on this subject in recent years. Indeed, I think President Clinton most succinctly expressed the importance of this problem when he said:  \\n   The single biggest social problem in our society may be the growing absence of fathers from their children\\'s homes because it contributes to so many other social problems.  \\n   So there are some things we can and should be trying to do. I am pleased to note our colleagues, Senators BAYH, DOMENICI, and others have been working to develop a legislative proposal, which I think contains some very constructive and creative approaches in which the Federal Government would support financially, with resources, some of these very promising grassroots father-promotion efforts, and also encourage and enact the removal of some of the legal and policy barriers that deter men from an active presence in their children\\'s lives. \\n   Another thing I think we can do to help is to use the platform we have on the Senate floor--this people\\'s forum --to elevate this problem on the national agenda. That is why Senator GREGG and I have come to the floor today. I am particularly grateful for the cosponsorship of the Senator from New Hampshire, because he is the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Children and Families. We are joined by a very broad and bipartisan group of cosponsors which includes Senators BAYH, BROWNBACK, MACK, DODD, DOMENICI, JEFFORDS, ALLARD, COCHRAN, LANDRIEU, BUNNING, ROBB, DORGAN, DASCHLE, and AKAKA. I thank them all for joining in the introduction of this special resolution this morning, which is to honor Father\\'s Day coming this Sunday, \\n   but also to raise our discussion of the problem of absent fathers in our hopes for the promotion of responsible fatherhood. \\n   Senator GREGG indicated this resolution would declare this Sunday\\'s holiday as National Fathers Return Day and call on dads around the country to use this day, particularly if they are absent, to reconnect and rededicate themselves to their children\\'s lives, to understand and have the self-confidence to appreciate how powerful a contribution they can make to the well-being of the children that they have helped to create, and to start by spending this Fathers\\' Day returning for part of the day to their children and expressing to their children the love they have for them and their willingness to support them.  \\n   The statement we hope to make this morning in this resolution obviously will not change the hearts and minds of distant or disengaged fathers, but those of us who are sponsoring the resolution hope it will help to spur a larger national conversation about the importance of fatherhood and help remind those absent fathers of their responsibilities, yes, but also of the opportunity they have to change the life of their child, about the importance of their fatherhood, and also help remind these absent fathers of the value of their involvement. \\n   We ask our colleagues to join us in supporting this resolution, and adopting it perhaps today but certainly before this week is out to make as strong a statement as possible and to move us one step closer to the day when every American child has the opportunity to have a truly happy Father\\'s Day because he or she will be spending it with their father. \\n   I thank the Chair. I yield the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990616\\n\\n    Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to join my distinguished colleague and friend, the chairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator MCCAIN, and my colleague from North Dakota, Senator CONRAD, in introducing legislation that we believe will move us another step forward in ameliorating the culture of violence surrounding our children, and in helping parents protect their kids from harm. \\n   This is a problem that has been much on our minds in the wake of the school massacre in Littleton and the other tragic shootings that preceded it, a series of events which has continued to reverberate through the national consciousness, which has in particular heightened our awareness as a nation to the violent images and messages bombarding our children, and which has in turn spurred a renewed debate about the entertainment media\\'s contributing role in the epidemic of youth violence we are experiencing across the nation, not just in suburban schools but on the streets and in homes in every community. \\n   We made an initial attempt to respond to this problem through the juvenile justice bill that the Senate recently passed, and I believe it was a good start. Senator MCCAIN and I joined Senators BROWNBACK and HATCH in cosponsoring a bipartisan amendment that would, among other things, authorize an investigation of the entertainment industry\\'s marketing practices to determine the extent to which they are targeting the sale of ultraviolent, adult-rated products directly to kids. \\n   This amendment, which was approved unanimously, would also facilitate the development of stronger codes of conduct for the various entertainment media and thereby encourage them to accept greater responsibility for the products they distribute. \\n   The bill we are introducing today, the 21st Century Media Responsibility Act, would build on that initial response and significantly improve our efforts in the future to limit children\\'s success to inappropriate and potentially harmful products. \\n   Specifically, it calls for the creation of a uniform labeling system for violent entertainment media products, to provide parents with clear, easy-to-understand warnings about the amount and degree of violence contained in the movies, music, television shows, and video games that are being mass-marketed today. Beyond that, it would require the businesses where these products are sold or distributed--the movie theaters, record and software stores, and rental outlets--to strictly enforce these new ratings, and thus prohibit children from buying or renting material that is meant for adults and may pose a risk to kids. \\n   This proposal is premised in many respects on our concerted efforts to keep cigarettes out of the hands of minors, and with good reason. As with tobacco, decades of research have shown definitively that media violence can be seriously harmful to children, that heavy, sustained exposure to violent images, particularly those that glamorize murder and mayhem and that fail to show any consequences, tends to desensitize young viewers and increase the potential they will become violent themselves. As with tobacco, and its mascot Joe Camel, we are beginning to see substantial evidence indicating that the entertainment industry is not satisfied with mass marketing mass murder, but that it is actually targeting products to children that the producers themselves admit are not appropriate for minors. \\n   And as with tobacco, we are seeking to change the behavior of a multi-billion dollar industry that too often seems locked in deep denial, that has shown little inclination to acknowledge there is a problem with its products, let alone work with us to find reasonable solutions to reduce the threat of media violence to children. \\n   Of course, there are differences between the tobacco and entertainment industries and the products they make. Cigarettes are filled with physical substances that have been proven to cause cancer in longtime smokers. Violent entertainment products have a less visible and physical effect on longtime viewers and listeners, and, more significantly, they are forms of speech that enjoy protection under the First Amendment. \\n   It is because of our devotion to the First Amendment that Senator MCCAIN and I, along with many other concerned critics, have been reluctant to call for government restrictions on the content of movies, music, television and video games. All along, we have urged entertainment industry leaders to police themselves, to draw lines and set higher standards, to balance their right to free expression with their responsibilities to the larger community to which they belong. We repeated these pleas with a new sense of urgency in the days following the shooting at Columbine High School, asking the most influential media voices to attend the White House summit meeting the President convened and to engage in open dialogue about what all of us can do to reduce the likelihood of another Littleton. \\n   And there has been a smattering of encouraging responses emanating from the entertainment media. For example, the Interactive Digital Software Association, which represents the video game manufacturers, has acknowledged that the grotesque and perverse violence used in some advertisements crosses the line, and it is reexamining its marketing code to respond to some of the concerns we have raised. Disney for its part announced that it would no longer house violent coin-operated video games in its amusement parks. The National Association of Theater Owners pledged to tighten the enforcement of its policies restricting the access of children to R-rated movies. And several prominent screenwriters, speaking at a recent forum sponsored by the Writers Guild of America, raised concerns about the level of violence in today\\'s movies and called on the industry to rethink its fascination with murder and mayhem. \\n   But overall the silence from the men and women who make the decisions that shape our culture has been deafening, their denials extremely disappointing. Not one CEO from the major entertainment conglomerates--Sony, Disney, Seagram, Time Warner, Viacom, and Fox--accepted the President\\'s invitation to attend the White House summit meeting. And since  then, not one has made a statement accepting some responsibility for the culture of violence surrounding our children, or indicating their willingness to address their part of the lethal mix that is turning kids into killers. What we have heard, from Seagram\\'s Edgar Bronfman and Time Warner\\'s Gerald Levin and Viacom\\'s Sumner Redstone, are more shrill denials and diversions, along with attacks on those of us in Congress who are concerned about what they are doing to our country and our kids. \\n   This is the responsibility vacuum in which we are operating, and this is the vacuum we are trying to fill with the legislation we are introducing today. Ideally, our bill would be unnecessary. Ideally, the various segments of the entertainment industry would agree to adopt and implement a set of common-sense, uniform standards that would provide for clear and concise labeling of media products, that would prohibit the marketing and sales of adult-rated products to children, and that would hold producers or retail outlets that violate the code accountable for their irresponsibility. But there is no sign that is going to happen any time soon, which is why we feel compelled to go forward with this proposal today. \\n   We are not advocating censorship, or placing restrictions on the kind of entertainment products that can be made and sold commercially. What we are doing through this bill is treating violent media like tobacco and other products that pose risks to children, requiring producers to provide explicit warnings to parents about potentially harmful content, and requiring retailers to take reasonable steps to limit the availability of adult-rated products with high doses of violence to audiences for which they are designed. That is why we have chosen to amend the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act, to accentuate the fact that we are not regulating artistic expression but the marketing and distribution of commercial products, and that we are not criminalizing speech, but demanding truth in labeling and enforcement. \\n   If a video game company is telling parents a game is not appropriate for children under 17, then parents should have a realistic expectation that this game will not be marketed or sold to that audience. Unfortunately, that is often not the case these days, and we would correct that by authorizing the Federal Trade Commission to investigate and punish retailers and rental outlets and movie theaters that in effect deceive parents about the products they are selling or renting to their kids. Specifically, it would authorize the FTC to levy fines of up to $10,000 per violation of the act\\'s provisions prohibiting the sale or rental of adult-rated products to children. \\n   This bill does not just respond to concerns of today, but anticipates the media landscape of tomorrow. According to most experts, as technologies converge over the next few years, more and more of our entertainment is going to be delivered through a single wire into the home over the Internet. In this radically different universe, it only makes sense to modernize the ratings concept to fit the new contours of the Information Age, and develop a standard labeling system for the video, audio, and interactive games we will consume through a common portal. Our legislation will move us in that direction and prod the entertainment industry to help parents meet the new challenges of this new era, and hopefully usher in a new ethic of media responsibility, a goal that is reflected in the bill\\'s title. \\n   In closing, Mr. President, I want to make clear that I do not consider this legislation to be ``the\\'\\' answer to the threat of media violence or the solution to repairing our culture. It won\\'t singlehandedly stop media standards from falling, or substitute for industry self-restraint. No one bill or combination of laws could replace the exercise of corporate citizenship, particularly given our respect for the First Amendment. We must continue to push the entertainment industry to embrace its responsibilities. But this bill is a common-sense, forward looking response that will in fact help reduce the harmful influences reaching our children and thereby reduce the risk of youth violence. That makes it more than worthwhile, and I ask my colleagues to join us in supporting it. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990610\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I see an opportunity here to make a few general comments about the bill as we await the next procedural step. With the Chair\\'s permission, I will proceed with that, which is to say to add my strong support to the underlying bill. \\n   Mr. President, Congress really needs to act to address the probable explosion of litigation over the Y2K problem. It needs to act quickly. This is a problem that has an activating date. It is nothing that will wait for Congress to act. It will be self-starting, self-arriving. Therefore, we must act in preparation for it. \\n   Obviously we are now familiar, if we had not been before this extended debate, with the problem caused by the Y2K bug. Although no one can predict with certainty what will happen at the turning of the year into the new century and the new millennium, there is little doubt that there will be Y2K-caused failures, possibly on a large scale, and that those failures could bring both minor inconveniences and significant disruptions in our lives. This could pose a serious problem for our economy, and if there are widespread failures, it will surely be in all of our interests for American businesses to focus on how they can continue providing the goods and services we all rely on in the face of those disruptions rather than fretting over and financing defense of lawsuits. \\n   Perhaps just as important as the challenge to our economy, the Y2K problem will present a unique challenge to our court system, unique because of the possible volume of litigation throughout the country that will likely result and because that litigation will commence within a span of a few months, potentially flooding the courts with cases and inundating American companies with lawsuits at precisely the time they need to devote their resources to fixing the problem. \\n   So I think it is appropriate for Congress to act now to ensure that our legal system is prepared to deal fairly, efficiently, and effectively with the Y2K problem, to make sure those problems that can be solved short of litigation will be solved that way, to make sure that companies that should be held liable for their actions will be held liable, but to also make sure that the Y2K problem does not just become an opportunity for a few enterprising individuals to profit from what is ultimately frivolous litigation, unfairly wasting the resources of companies that have done nothing wrong, companies large and small, or diverting the resources of companies that should be devoting themselves to keeping our economy going to fixing the problem. \\n   To that end, I was privileged to work with the leadership of the Commerce Committee and the sponsors of this legislation, particularly Senators MCCAIN, WYDEN and DODD, to try to craft a more targeted response to this Y2K problem. \\n   Like many others here, I was actually uncomfortable with the scope, the breadth, and the contents of the initial draft of this legislation because I thought it went beyond dealing with our concerns about the Y2K potential litigation explosion and became a general effort to adopt tort reform. I took those concerns to the bill\\'s sponsors, as others did. Together I found them to be responsive and we worked out those concerns. I am very grateful to them for that. \\n   With the addition of the amendments offered by Senators DODD, WYDEN and others, we have a package now before us that I think we can really be proud of and with which we can be comfortable because it is one that will help  us fairly manage the Y2K litigation while protecting legal rights and due process. \\n   Provisions like the one requiring notice before filing a lawsuit will help save the resources of our court system while giving parties the opportunity to work out their problems before incurring the costs of litigation and the hardening of positions the filing of a lawsuit often brings. \\n   The requirement that defects be material for a class action to be brought will allow recovery for those defects that are of consequence while keeping those with no real injury from using the court system to extort settlements out of companies that have done them no real harm. And the provision in this bill keeping plaintiffs with contractual relationships with defendants from seeking, through tort actions, damages that their contracts do not allow them to get, will make sure that settled business expectations, as expressed in duly negotiated and executed contracts, are honored and that plaintiffs get precisely but not more than the damages they are entitled to under those contracts. \\n   I also think it is important for everyone to recognize that the bill we have before us today is not the bill that was originally introduced, not even the bill that was reported out of the Commerce Committee. Because of the cooperative efforts of Senators MCCAIN, DODD, WYDEN, GORTON, and so many others who are interested in seeing this legislation move forward, this bill has been significantly tailored to meet the urgent problems we may face. \\n   I will conclude by saying that this legislation will not protect wrongdoers or deprive those deserving of compensation. What it will do is make sure that what we have in place is a fair and effective way to resolve Y2K disputes, one that will help make sure we do not compound any problems caused by the Y2K bug, even larger problems caused by unnecessary litigation. \\n   This is good legislation, and I am optimistic that it will soon pass the Senate and that we will, thereby, have dealt with a problem which otherwise would be much larger than it should be. \\n   I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor. \\n   Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990527\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss several provisions within the FY2000 Defense Authorization Act. These provisions can be found in Title II, Subtitle D, Sections 231-239 within the FY2000 Defense Authorization Act. The provisions are intended to stimulate intense technical innovation within our military research and development (R&D) enterprise and hence lay the foundation for revolutionary changes in future warfare concepts. Before giving an extended introduction to these defense innovation provisions, I would like to thank Senator ROBERTS and Senator BINGAMAN and the staff who have worked on this subtitle--particularly Pamela Farrell, Peter Levine, John Jennings, Frederick Downey, Merrilea Mayo, and William Bonvillian--for their hard and thoughtful work on this legislation. The technical superiority of our military is something we have come to take for granted, yet it is founded in an R&D system that has seen little change since the cold war era. These defense innovation provisions attempt to reposition our R&D system so that it can keep up with the pace of technological change in the very different world we are in today. \\n   It is my belief that the explosive advances in technology may provide the basis for not just a ``revolution in military affairs,\\'\\' but a complete paradigm shift. With advanced communication and information systems, it may become possible to fight a war without concentrating forces, making force organizations impossible to kill. With advances in robotics and miniaturization, it may become possible to fight a ground war with far fewer people. With advances in nuclear power, hydrolysis, and hydrogen storage, it may be possible to create virtually unlimited sources of on-site power. These opportunities are complemented by numerous challenges, also brought forth by technology: urban warfare, space warfare, electronic/information warfare, chemical, nuclear, and biological warfare, and warfare relying on underground storage centers and facilities. As the variety of opportunities and threats continues to climb, and as increasing numbers of nations emerge into the high tech arena, I believe the military arms race of the past will be replaced by a military technology race. Instead of simply accumulating ever greater numbers of conventional armaments against a well-established foe, as we did in the Cold War era, we will have to concentrate on producing fewer, but ever more rapidly evolving, and ever more specialized weapons systems to counter specific asymmetric threats. \\n   To meet these new challenges, we need to transform our R&D enterprise from its antiquated Cold War structure to a fast-moving, well-integrated R&D machine that can seize the leading edge of techno-warfare. For this reason Senator ROBERTS, Senator BINGAMAN and I have inserted provisions within Title II, Subtitle D of the FY2000 Defense Authorization Act whose purpose is to stimulate a much greater and faster degree of technical innovation within the military. \\n   The defense innovation provisions address three goals--establishing a new vision for military R&D, changing the structure of the military R&D enterprise, and correcting the driving forces for R&D in our current system. For the first task, establishing a new vision, Section 231 of the FY2000 Defense Authorization Act requires DoD to determine the most dangerous adversarial threats we will likely face two to three decades from now, and what technologies will be needed on our part to prevail against those threats. Given that it takes 20-30 years to translate basic science to fielded application, our R&D vision needs to be founded on a set of required operational capabilities that is equally distant in time, and far beyond the 5 year vision of our current Program Objective Memorandums (POM\\'s). We need not strive for perfect clairvoyance in this exercise; however, we should be able to create an open conceptual architecture which successfully frames the many potential future opportunities and threats. Once the far future threats and hence far future operational capabilities are outlined, Section 231 asks DOD to give Congress a roadmap of future systems hardware and technologies our services will have to deploy within two to three decades to assure US military dominance in that time frame. From the first roadmap, we are requesting DOD derive a second roadmap--the R&D path that DOD, in cooperation with the private sector, will have to follow to obtain these new defense technologies and systems. To add depth and perspective to the results, I encourage the Secretary of Defense to utilize an independent review panel of outside experts in these exercises, to complement the work done by in-house personnel. The broader our vision, the more likely it is to be inclusive of whatever surprises the actual future may bring. \\n   A second goal of the defense innovation provisions, Subtitle D, is to lay the groundwork for a new organizational structure for R&D. Unless we fix the innovation structure, we will be unable to deliver to DOD the rapid technological advances it will need to secure and maintain world dominance. To meet the challenges of the upcoming decades, the Defense Science Board has recommended that at least one third of the technologies pursued by DoD be ones that offer 5 to 10 fold improvements in military capabilities. However, the current structure, which was founded on Cold War realities, will require large organizational change to enable it to pursue revolutionary, rather than evolutionary, technology goals. The segregated and insulated components of the military R&D system will need to be seamlessly interwoven, and the system as a whole will need to be much more flexible in its interactions with the outside world. We can learn from the success of the commercial sector, which takes advantage of temporary alliances between competitors and peers to develop technologies at a breathtaking pace. \\n   The defense innovation provisions ask DoD to formulate a modern blueprint for the structure, of not only its laboratories, but of the extended set of policies, institutions, and organizations which together make up its entire innovation system. As noted earlier, the Defense Science Board has  called for the military R&D system to increase its focus on revolutionary new technologies. The overarching goal of the new structural plan requested by Section 233 is to deliver the conceptual architecture for an innovation system that is capable of routinely providing such revolutionary advances. Section 239 requests an analysis by the Defense Science Board of overlaps and gaps within the current system. Section 233 asks the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition to develop the plan for the future innovation system, one which ensures that joint technologies, technologies developed in other government laboratories, and technologies developed in the private sector can readily flow into and across the military R&D labs and the broader innovation structure as a whole. Section 233 emphasizes the need to develop better processes for identifying private sector technologies of military value, and military technologies \\n   of commercial value. Once identified, there also need to be efficient processes in place for transfer of those technologies, so that the military may reap the respective military and economic gains. Also in Section 233, the Under Secretary is requested to deliver a solution to the major structural gap which currently exists between the R&D pipeline and the acquisition pipeline. Development of the best technologies in the world will not help our future military posture if those technologies are never adopted, or even seen, by the acquisition arms of our services. Finally, to better merge the strategic and technological threads within the military\\'s decision making process, Section 233 in the FY2000 Defense Authorization Act requests a DoD plan for modifying the ongoing education of its future military leadership (i.e., its uniformed officers) so they may better understand the technological opportunities and threats they face. \\n   The laboratories themselves could and should play a crucial role in our future military. Ideally, the military laboratories are the place where the minds of the brightest scientists meet the demands of the most experienced warfighters. Out of this intense dialogue would then come a clearer understanding of future warfare possibilities, as well as the technological breakthroughs critical to changing the face of warfare as we know it. For various reasons, however, that vision is in danger of becoming lost. One specific problem is DoD\\'s rigid personnel system and the corresponding lack of performance-based compensation, which is causing the labs to rapidly hemorrhage talent to the more competitive and less bureaucratic private sector. To address these issues, a defense innovation provision within the FY2000 Defense Authorization Act--specifically, Section 237--repeals several of the labs\\' restrictive personnel regulations. The intent of this Section is to drastically reduce hiring times and eliminate artificial salary constraints to the point where defense laboratories can hire new talent in a time frame and at a salary level that is similar to that offered by the private and university sectors. Currently, the two processes are not even close to competitive: the military R&D labs take several months to over a year to extend an offer, with the result that the laboratories, over and over again, lose the hiring race to private sector interests which can hire top-notch talent in one or two weeks. As noted by the Defense Science Board report, the salaries which can be offered by the laboratories are also about 50 percent lower (for higher grade new hires), compared to the salaries those same new hires could obtain in the private sector. It is significant that the hiring time problem, as well as the high grade caps problem, were universally cited by laboratory managers as the key obstacles in upgrading their laboratory talent. \\n   In addition to improving the quality of the laboratories\\' effort by attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel, the defense innovation provisions ask the Secretary of Defense to improve the quality of work itself by developing a system of modern business performance metrics which can be implemented within and across all military laboratories (Section 239(b)). Such metrics can help ensure that the best work and the best talent are identified, so that they may be rewarded, nurtured and used accordingly. As a word of caution, the ultimate impact of science and technology innovation is very hard to measure, especially in the early stages. Overly mechanical assessments inevitably do much more harm than good. Nevertheless, advanced technology companies have been making great strides in better assessing (and assisting) their innovation efforts, and DOD is encouraged to work with industry R&D leaders in implementing this section. Examples of metrics which may be useful for DOD labs include measurement of lab quality through formal annual peer reviews of its divisions, measurement of technical relevance through required customer approval/evaluation of R&D projects both before and after they are undertaken, and measurement of organizational relevance through annual board meetings of senior military with the heads of the R&D laboratories. The first of these metrics can help capture and bring attention to promising work in its earliest stages, while the last two can help bridge the gap between later stage innovation and new products. \\n   The need for structural reform within the laboratories is a pressing one. The above-mentioned reforms are intended to be jump started with a pilot program, found in Section 236 of the Defense Authorization Provisions. This pilot program may address any of the issues mentioned above but is particularly focused on the problem of attracting and retaining the best possible talent for the laboratories. To be more competitive with working conditions in the commercial sector, this pilot program may include such innovations as pay for performance, starting bonuses (e.g., in the form of equipment start-up funds) for attracting key scientists, ability to alter reduction in force (RIF) retention rules to favor high performers, broadbanding of pay grades, simplified employee classification, educational programs which allow employees to receive advanced degrees while still employed, modification of priority placement procedures, and creation of employee participation and reward programs. \\n   To attract the best possible outside talent for collaborations with the laboratories, Section 236 also encourages expansion of exchange programs at both the personal and institutional level. Programs for exchanges within DoD, with the private sector, and with academic institutions are all encouraged. Examples of such programs include the sponsorship of talented students through college or graduate school in exchange for later work commitments to the laboratories, expansion of the federated laboratory concept, increased exchanges between the defense laboratories and the war colleges, training programs, and extension of IPA authority to hire commercial sector employees. The Defense Science Board has strongly recommended that the laboratories emulate DARPA in its mix of temporary and permanent workers in order to be able to quickly bring in relevant talent when needs shift. Section 236(a)(2) creates this option and can be used in conjunction with other provisions in Subtitle D. \\n   A new structure and a new vision are all well and good, but if there is no motivation for the new structure to proceed towards the new vision, nothing is gained. Consequently, the third goal of the defense innovation provisions is to correct current forces which tend to drive DoD away from technical innovation. Three of these driving forces are described below. \\n   The first ``counter-innovation\\'\\' driving force is the lack of a well-defined customer within the military for far future military technologies. Ideally, this customer would be at the Joint Chiefs level, so that broadly sweeping strategies which capitalize on novel technologies can be rapidly incorporated into our existing military structure, doctrine, and systems. Unfortunately, there is little connection at present between that level and the service laboratories. Section 239(b) should be used to improve this situation. Furthermore, as part of the legislation\\'s mandated study on improving the structure of our R&D system (Section 233), we also request the Under Secretary of Defense to address the issue of a suitable internal customer for truly long range R&D. For maximum impact and credibility, this customer--whether it be a person, position, or organization--should be a bona  fide paying customer who has responsibility not just for the long range technology itself, but for the unconventional military options such technology provides. \\n   The lack of an internal customer for long range R&D is one driving force pulling the military away from technical innovation. The second is the vacuum-like force created by the absence of an intimate connection between the R&D customers and producers within the later stages of R&D. Specifically, there is an insufficient connection between the program managers who sponsor product development and the R&D workforce performing later stage R&D. In contrast, the industrial experience has shown that if the customer, researchers, and designers share in all product development decisions from the very initial stages of concept design, the degree of innovation is much higher, the product acceptance rate is much higher, and, ultimately, the pace of technological change is dramatically accelerated. Section 233(b)(5) directs the Under Secretary of Defense to identify how new technologies can be rapidly transi-Ð tioned from late stage R&D to product development and prepare an appropriate plan for doing so. One sub-issue within this larger problem is this need to create a DoD customer--DoD researcher--DoD designer interaction that is early enough and robust enough to ensure that maturing innovations can be drawn into product lines on a time scale similar to that experienced in the commercial sector. This sub-issue should be addressed in the Under Secretary\\'s plan under Section 233(b)(5). \\n   The third force which drives the military away from technological innovation is the lack of a customer outside the military for innovative military technologies. Were such a customer present, it might partially make up for the lack of the other two drivers in terms of motivating innovation. Currently, the most important external customer for military R&D is the industrial half of the military-industrial complex. However, the structure of our procurement regulations give virtually identical profit margins to these companies no matter how difficult the technical path or how many risks are undertaken in the process of producing a military system. Therefore, the continued production of legacy systems is guaranteed to be profitable, while gambling with innovative new systems is not. Essentially, our procurement regulations are a direct disincentive to innovation, giving the defense industry a strong vested interest in adhering to incremental change. The resulting lobbying by industry, aimed squarely at preserving the ``state-of-yesterday\\'s-art,\\'\\' then significantly slows the rate at which the military can innovate. Accordingly, one of the defense innovation provisions, specifically Section 234, Subtitle D, Title II of the FY 2000 Defense Authorization Act, calls for DoD to change its profit margins for acquisitions in order to alter the innovation incentives for industry. Given substantially higher profit levels for the development of innovative systems, than for the continued production of legacy systems, industry could become much more receptive to the idea of cultivating innovation in fielded hardware. Substantive, consistent economic rewards are critical to incentivizing companies to take the necessary and serious technological risks required to produce the innovations DOD must have. \\n   In closing, I thank my colleagues Senators ROBERTS and BINGAMAN for joining me in develoing a set of stimulating and thought-provoking defense innovation provisions within Subtitle D, Title II of the FY2000 Defense Authorization bill. These provisions should launch us towards a new vision, a new structure, and a new set of driving forces for military R&D. In the past 48 years, DoD has funded the pre-award research of 58 percent of this country\\'s Nobel laureates in Chemistry, and 43 percent of this country\\'s Nobel laureates in Physics. This is a phenomenal base on which to build. However, the Cold War structure and rationale for our R&D enterprise needs to be shed so that leading edge techno-warfare can emerge. The time to do this is now, because, in many senses, the future is already here. The military systems of 2020 and 2030 will be founded on the science of the year 2000. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-2-19990527\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the FY 2000 defense authorization bill. As the challenges facing us today demonstrate, the effectiveness of our military, and its readiness to act immediately to protect our national interests, must always be a priority concern for Congress. The $288.8 billion proposed in this bill is a 2 percent real increase over last year\\'s budget and is the first real increase in topline defense funding since FY 1985, the middle of the Reagan administration. After fourteen years of declining, or flat defense spending, we increased authorization for readiness programs by $1.1 billion, we increased authorizations for procurement by $2.9 billion, and we increased authorizations for reasearch and development by $1.5 billion. I firmly believe this bill makes an important statement at a critical time, affirming our commitment to having the best trained, best equipped, and most effective military in the world, both today and tomorrow. \\n   Under the excellent leadership of our colleagues, Senator JOHN WARNER, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and the ranking Democrat, Senator CARL LEVIN, we stepped up to our responsibility to provide what our soldiers, sailors, and airmen need today, and we took some very important steps to move toward the military that will protect our nation in the next century. \\n   The past 14 years of inadequate defense spending has taken a toll on the readiness of our force today. We simply were not able to keep our training and maintenance at the levels that our role as a superpower demands. The struggle to do so, and the increasing need to use our forces to meet the many challenges of the post cold war world has taken its toll not just on equipment, but on our people in uniform. Simply put, the morale of our forces is suffering. This past year, we not only sought out and listened to our nation\\'s top military leaders as they outlined the problems facing our military, but in this bill we addressed the most critical of those problems, including falling recruitment and retention in critical skill areas; aging equipment that costs more to keep operating at acceptable levels of reliability; a need for more support services for a force with a high percentage of married personnel. \\n   So I am pleased and proud that we reversed the 14 years of declining defense dollars and added the money to readiness and procurement to fix the most urgent near-term readiness problems. But many of these problems are not simple to address, and simply adding money to budget lines will not fix them any more than adding money to welfare programs fixed the underlying welfare problem in America. Adding money was necessary, but it won\\'t be enough. How we spend the money we spend is as important as how much money we spend. We will have to be sure that we are alert to how well the provisions we have included here are working to have a positive effect on those critical problems we must solve. \\n   This will be more difficult than it has been in the past. We are now in an era of fundamental change for our security and our military. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the unprecedented explosion in technology are now redefining what it is we are asking our military to do, the threats that it must overcome to do what we ask of it, and the capabilities that our military will bring to bear to successfully accomplish its mission. This body has been in the forefront of demanding rigorous assessments about our needs and our potential. We directed, in the Military Force Structure Review Act of 1996, the Secretary of Defense to complete a comprehensive assessment of the defense strategy, force structure, force modernization plans, infrastructure, and other elements of the defense policies and programs with a view toward determining and expressing the defense strategy of the United States and establishing a revised program. This assessment, completed by the Secretary of Defense in 1997, declared that our future force will be different in character than our current force, and placed great emphasis on the need to prepare now for an uncertain future by exploiting the revolution in technology and transforming the force toward that envisioned in Joint Vision 2010. The independent National Defense Panel report published in December 1997 concluded ``the Department of Defense should accord the highest priority to executing a transformation strategy for the U.S. military, starting now.\\'\\' These assessments, and others that have come to our attention, have reinforced the wisdom of Congress in passing in 1986, over the Pentagon\\'s strenuous objections, the Goldwater-Nichols act and have provided us here with a compelling argument that the future security environment will be different and that environment requires new capabilities. In last year\\'s defense authorization bill we sent a strong signal to the Pentagon that we must begin to build the fundamentally different military by including a provision strongly supporting Joint Experimentation to objectively examine our future needs and how we can best fulfill them. \\n   This year, once again, Congress is stepping up to the responsibility to ensure our future security. By establishing this year the Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee, Senator WARNER addressed the growing consensus that transformation of our military to deal with the uncertain future we face is one of our most important objectives and that promoting innovation is among our greatest challenges. Under the leadership of the subcommittee chairman, Senator ROBERTS and the Ranking Member, Senator BINGAMAN, we focused on the critical threats facing our nation and the emerging capabilities to deal with these threats. I would like to highlight what I think are important legislative provisions that this new subcommittee placed in this bill that further both transformation and innovation. An ongoing initiative of transformation supported by this bill is joint experimentation. The committee recognized the program\\'s progress in developing joint service warfighting requirements, doctrinal improvements, and in promoting the values and benefits of joint operations for future wars and contingency operations. We need to continue to identify and assess interdependent areas of joint warfare which will be key in transforming the conduct of future U.S. military operations, and expanding projected joint experimentation activities this year will be a strong base for future efforts. To this end the committee approved provisions that built on its previous support for Joint Experimentation by adding $10 million to accelerate the establishment of the organization responsible for joint experimentation, and to accelerate the conduct of the initial joint experiments. The committee also modified the reporting requirements of the commander responsible for joint experimentation to send a strong signal that we expect him to make important and difficult recommendations about future requirements for forces, organizations, and doctrine and that we expect the Secretary of Defense fully inform us about what action he takes as a result of these recommendations. The bill also includes very important provisions to stimulate a greater degree of  technical innovation faster within the military. It is my belief that the explosive advances in technology provide the basis for not just a ``revolution in military affairs,\\'\\' but ultimately a complete paradigm shift. The opportunities provided by technology give us the promise of achieving an order of magnitude increase in military capability over that which we have today. The U.S. military of \\n   2020 and 2030 will be based on the science we begin to develop in the year 2000. But to take advantage of this promise and defend ourselves against its use against us by future adversaries, we need to transform our R&D enterprise from its antiquated cold war structure to a fast-moving, better-integrated structure and a process that can seize the leading edge of techno-warfare. The Defense Innovation provisions in this bill establish a new vision for military R&D that is based more on how we want to fight in the future, and begin to change the structure of the military R&D enterprise to achieve that objective through better integration and less inefficiency. \\n   To help establish a new vision, the provisions require the Secretary of Defense to determine the most dangerous adversarial threats we will likely face two to three decades from now and what technologies will be needed on our part to prevail against those threats, and merge the strategic and technological decision-making processes. To help lay the groundwork for a new organizational structure for R&D, the Department of Defense is to develop a plan which ensures the crossflow of technologies into and across R&D labs, and close the gap between the R&D pipeline and the acquisition pipeline, to ensure the customer is involved in the entire R&D process. Our R&D structure needs to be revamped now so that leading edge techno-warfare can emerge. \\n   Along the same lines as innovation, this bill has provisions that ensure we continue to step up to our responsibility to oversee the transformation of our military to the future force that will protect our security in the 21st century. We need a permanent requirement that the Secretary of Defense conduct a Quadrennial Defense Review at the beginning of each new administration to determine and express the defense strategy of our nation, and establish a revised defense plan for the next 10 to 20 years. Complementing the QDR will be a National Defense Panel that would conduct an assessment of the defense strategy, force structure, force modernization plans, infrastructure, budget plan, and other elements of the defense program and policies established under the previous quadrennial defense review. Based on our previous experiences with the QDR and NDP, and the debate they raised, it is obvious that any one time assessment is not going to provide all the answers we need. Periodic assessments as prescribed by this legislation will continue to provide Congress with a compelling forecast of the future security environment and the military challenges we will face. \\n   The requirement for the provisions I have mentioned is paramount. The need for renewed emphasis on innovation and transformation has never been more apparent to me than after my time this year as the Ranking Member on the AirLand Subcommittee. That committee, under the excellent leadership of Senator RICK SANTORUM, examined many modernization issues affecting the Army and the Air Force. Some of the findings were disturbing, and reinforce the fact that despite the widespread and growing consensus that transformation is essential to our military, our budgets continue to look much as they have for a decade, focused on today\\'s force at the expense of tomorrow. I would like to discuss some of the disturbing findings, and some of the important provisions we included in the bill to begin to address these concerns. \\n   We found that some responsible voices are concerned that the United States Army is facing a condition of deteriorating strategic relevance. The Army force structure is essentially still a cold war force structure built around very heavy weapons systems. The Army modernization program is based on incremental improvements to this force and is largely unfunded due to hard choices made in the past. This has resulted in inefficient programs and extended program timelines. Consequently we have a force that looks essentially the same today as it did yesterday, and that doesn\\'t have enough money to maintain an increasingly expensive current force and invest in the Army After Next which is the future. Kosovo is an example of the future the Army will surely face; operations that are increasingly urbanized, with growing deployment and access problems, and the need for lighter weight, self-deployable systems becomes compelling. We reviewed the Army\\'s modernization plan to understand the relationship between the current service modernization program and projected land force challenges. The Army\\'s modernization plans do not appear adequately address these issues. So we have required the Army to take a renewed look at its modernization plans generally, and its armor and aviation modernization programs specifically, to address these challenges and to provide us with modernization plans that are complete and that will be fully funded in future budgets. We direct this analysis include the operational capabilities that are necessary for the Army to prevail against the future land force challenges, including asymetrical threats, and the key capabilities and characteristics of of the future Army systems needed to achieve these operational capabilities. We are especially concerned about the ability of the Army to maintain the current fleet of helicopters that is rapidly aging and we have included a provision to require them to provide a complete and funded program that would upgrade, modernize, or retire the entire range of aircraft currently in the fleet, or provide an alternative that is sufficient and affordable. Similarly, the Army\\'s armor modernization plan seems to be inadequate to modernize the current armor force while designing the tank of the future, and leads me to believe that the Army must reassess armor system plans and provide us with the most appropriate path to accelerate the development of the future combat vehicle. \\n   The Air Force has fewer apparent modernization problems than the Army, but I wonder if their modernization plan is on the right track. Our hearings strongly suggest that the Department of Defense needs to answer several questions about our tactical air requirements, not the least of which is the characteristics, mix, and numbers of aircraft best suited for future conflicts. Kosovo is an example of how important the right mix of platforms and weapons really is to success on the battlefields of the future. We are embarked on three new TAC air programs which may report increasing costs coming dangerously close to the cost caps we have established, and in the case of the F-22 we must be alert to the danger that we will delay critical testing in order to not exceed the caps. And in the out years, the combined costs of these programs will consume a very large share of the overall procurement budget. We must make sure that we are not sacrificing other leading-edge capabilities, like unmanned aerial vehicles, information technology, or space technology. The specific aircraft programs will require close scrutiny as will the strategy for their use as we attempt to decide on the right course in future authorization bills. \\n   We must overcome our cold war mentality and further examine and direct our trek into the 21st century. The provisions in this bill concerning innovation and transformation lay the foundation for the required changes in our defense mind set that will become mandatory as we face far different conflicts in the future--and, as we see on CNN everyday, much of that future is already here. \\n   In closing, I express my appreciation to the committee for agreeing to include in the bill a provision to extend and expand the highly successful Troops to Teachers program, which I joined Senators MCCAIN and ROBB in sponsoring. \\n   As my colleagues may know, this program was initially authorized by Congress several years ago to help transition retiring and downsized military personnel into jobs where they could continue their commitment to public service and bring their valuable skills to bear for the benefit of America\\'s students. \\n   To date Troops to Teachers has placed more than 3,000 retired or  downsized service members in public schools in 48 different states, providing participants with assistance in obtaining the proper certification or licensing and matching them up with prospective employers. In return, these new teachers bring to the classroom what educators say our schools need most: mature and disciplined role models, most of them male and many of them minorities, well-trained in math and science and high tech fields, highly motivated, and highly capable of working in challenging environments. \\n   The legislation we introduced earlier in the year, and which the President has endorsed, aims to build on this success by encouraging more military retirees to move into teaching. It would do so by offering those departing troops new incentives to enter the teaching profession, particularly for those who are willing to serve in areas with large concentrations of at-risk children and severe shortages of qualified teaching candidates. \\n   Even with the new incentives we are creating, which we hope will recruit as many as 3,000 new teachers each year, we recognize that Troops to Teachers will still only make a modest dent in solving the national teacher shortage. The Department of Education estimates that America\\'s public schools will need to hire more than two million new teachers over the next decade. \\n   But we are confident that, with an extremely modest investment, we will make a substantial contribution to our common goals of not just filling classroom slots, but doing so in way that raises teaching standards and helping our children realize their potential. I can\\'t think of a better source of teaching candidates than the pool of smart, disciplined and dedicated men and women who retire from the military every year. \\n   What\\'s more, with this bill, we may well galvanize support for a recruitment method that, as Education Secretary Richard Riley has suggested, could serve as a model for bringing many more bright, talented people from different professions to serve in our public schools. This really is an ingenious idea, helping us to harness a unique national resource to meet a pressing national need, and I think we would be well served as country to build on it. \\n   In putting together this bill, once again hard choices had to be made. We closely examined and analyzed the critical defense issues, and we ended up with are effective and affordable defense authorization bill which meets the growing readiness and retention challenges facing our armed forces, and augments our investment in the research, development, and procurement of the weapon systems necessary to maintain our military superiority well into the 21st Century. This bill compensates our most valuable resource, our service men and women, plus lays the groundwork for a sensible and executable programs for our military. I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation and send an unequivocal message of support to our troops and their families. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990525\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I wanted to indicate to the Senate why I was unavoidably absent, as was recorded in yesterday\\'s RECORD, at the time of the vote on amendment 384 to S. 1059. I was in Connecticut yesterday. Because of serious thunderstorm and wind conditions my flight from Connecticut to Washington was delayed for several hours, causing me to miss the vote on the amendment. \\n   As yesterday\\'s RECORD indicates, had I been able to return to vote, I would have voted for the amendment, which passed 90 to 0. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990525\\n\\n    Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President I rise today to pay a well-deserved tribute to Ruth A. Geller, MSW on the occasion of her retirement from the Connecticut Mental Health Center after 25 years of service as a psychiatric social worker supervisor. \\n   Ruth has demonstrated exceptional compassion, dedication, and professionalism in caring for the severely, chronically mentally impaired of Connecticut. As a mentor and teacher, Ruth has trained a generation of mental health professionals with the same devotion she has brought to her clinical work. As a result, Ruth has instilled in them the ability to become respectful, empathetic mental health providers. \\n   I am proud to stand before the Senate to congratulate Ruth Geller upon her retirement and thank her for an outstanding career which has enhanced the lives of so many. I wish her continued success in the years ahead.  \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990524\\n\\n    Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to bring to the attention of Senators the retirement of Major General David W. Gay, Adjutant General of the Connecticut National Guard, after a military career that has spanned more than 40 years. \\n   The recipient of many military awards and honors, including the Army Distinguished Service Medal, the Legion of Merit Award, and the National Guard Bureau\\'s Eagle Award, General Gay has been a valuable friend to me and all the people of Connecticut. His experience and dedication have helped make the Connecticut National Guard the exemplary organization that it is today. \\n   General Gay\\'s contributions to the state go far beyond his command of both the Army and Air National Guard. His record of community service equals his record of military service and his participation in such activities as the Nutmeg State Games and the Character Counts State Advisory Board demonstrate his love for the community he calls home. \\n   Even in retirement, General Gay will continue to work for the people of Connecticut as the state\\'s Year 2000 Coordinator. I am happy to extend my thanks to General Gay for his years of distinguished service and offer my best wishes in his retirement.  \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990524\\n\\n    Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to formally congratulate Westport Volunteer Emergency Services on its 20th Anniversary. The fine men and women who founded, operate, and support this organization have distinguished themselves as one the pillars on which the principles of community service rest. \\n   The EMS team has truly been an asset to the town of Westport and has had a profound impact on the individuals and families who have benefited from its experience and training. Its quick service and professional response has made it one of the state\\'s most well-respected EMS corps. We have all been taught that we have an obligation to help our neighbors in need, but this organization has truly taken this credo to heart and has earned commendation for the lives it has saved, the families it has assisted, and the time it has contributed to improving the entire community. \\n   I give special congratulations to the 23 original members and staff of WVEMS who are still active today. They should be very proud of the positive impact of this organization, and I am certain that they appreciate more than anyone the growth and development of this outstanding EMS corps. \\n   Westport EMS provides immediate, front-line assistance that is so valuable to our neighbors in needs and does so on a volunteer basis. Its efforts have made a difference to children and adults alike over these last two decades and done more than its part to improve the Town of Westport. I an confident that Westport Volunteer Emergency Medical Services will continue its sterling record of service far into the future.  \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990512\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. \\n   Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment. I am privileged to be a cosponsor of the amendment with the Senator from Kansas, Mr. BROWNBACK, and with the Senator from Utah, Chairman HATCH. \\n   This amendment incorporates several proposals which many of us have been working on together across party lines in this Chamber to try to tone down one of the influences that we are convinced is contributing to the outbreak and crisis of youth violence in our country. \\n   Two other colleagues whom I have been privileged to work with are Senator MCCAIN of Arizona and Senator KOHL of Wisconsin. At this time I ask unanimous consent that Senators MCCAIN and KOHL be added as original cosponsors of this amendment. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-2-19990512\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, in the wake of the tragic shooting in Littleton, we as a nation, as individuals, are focusing in on an unsettling fact: No matter how good times are economically in America, something seems to have gone wrong in our country, something that is whetting the taste for blood and death in our children, turning too many of them into killers in our schools, in the suburbs, on the urban street corners, and in the homes of every kind of community throughout our country. \\n   As I have listened to this discussion at home in Connecticut, and as I have listened to it here on the floor of the Senate, in the committees and caucus rooms of this Capitol, I think what is important is that we are all recognizing and accepting that this is an extremely complicated problem without a single cause, fueled by an amorphous mix of factors. \\n   A child is not, if I may say, a natural born killer. A child, unfortunately, is affected by a variety of circumstances that make him into a killer, from the disengagement of parents, from the makeup of the child himself, to the disconnection and alienation that many children feel from their families, their peers, their communities, to the weakening of our moral and community safety nets. This is a mix that has been  made more deadly in our time by the easy access many children have to guns. \\n   Most of what we know for sure, as we consider the complexity of the problem, is, unfortunately, in the statistics, there is a Littleton every day. An average of 13 children die from gunshot wounds every 24 hours in America--some self-inflicted and more from murder. \\n   The fact is that no civilized country in the world comes close to matching this level of homicide and suicide, let alone the massacres we have seen committed in public places. The more we look at this problem, the more we understand--many of us--that the environment in which we are raising our children, with all of the death and destruction and dismemberment and degradation that we expose them to in the entertainment media, with the wealth of perverse messages we send them romanticizing and in many ways sanitizing violence--all of that has an effect. All of that draws a connection between the culture and the killing, between the viciousness pouring out of our children and piling up throughout our society. \\n   I know there are skeptics and naysayers who, despite the reams of evidence and scientific and anecdotal information gleaned from Littleton, Jonesboro, Paducah, and elsewhere--despite all that our intuition tells us about the omnipresence of electronic media and the pull on our society, despite all of this--cling to the notion that the culture of violence is harmless, that the relentless assault of virtual murder and mayhem on our children is having no effect, and that it can\\'t be true. There has always been violence in our country, these skeptics rationalize. There has always been violence in the culture. So the answers must lie elsewhere. \\n   But the answer lies within each of us, and within each of the groups and industries we are referring to here. The truth is, we have always had alienated, disaffected, and in some cases mentally troubled children. We have always had the cruel taunting of adolescents, the cliques in schools, and in many parts of the country we have also always had guns within easy reach of children. And yet, never before in the history of our \\n   country have we seen this level of violence among our children. Something entirely different, chillingly different, is happening, and we have to find out what it is and do something about it. \\n   We could spend weeks discussing this question. In fact, in another amendment several of us will be proposing a year-long commission to look at the problems underneath the problems. \\n   Clearly, some of it has to do with the fact that many of the traditional transmitters of values we have long relied on to shape the moral sense of our children--family, community, faith, and school--have been weakened in recent years, and more and more what is filling that value vacuum is the enormously alluring and powerful, influential entertainment media which too often has become a standard shredder instead of a standard setter. \\n   So how do we in this society that so values freedom of expression urge and push the entertainment industry to self-control, to self-regulate, to acknowledge not that they are causing this problem but that they are contributing to a crisis that is killing too many of our children? \\n   It is not easy. I think in this amendment we have found a way to begin to do it with an industry code of conduct exempting those in the entertainment industry from the fear of antitrust prosecutions so that they can work together to develop a code of conduct which will protect them from what some of them claim to be: With the currently existing competitive pressure downward, if the other company produces an ultra-violent movie and makes money, we have got to do it. \\n   Of course, nobody has to do anything. Lines should be drawn about what people won\\'t do to make an extra dollar or two or an extra 10 million dollars or two. \\n   This amendment enables the companies to get together to do just that, and also to enforce the rating system that they themselves put on. We don\\'t want to be censors. Let the industries themselves rate their products, as they do now. But then let them agree not to market products that they have rated as inappropriate, as harmful to children. Let them agree that when they rate a movie as unsuitable for kids under 17, there ought to be some responsibility in the theater owner not to let children under 17 into that movie, just the way there was responsibility on the owner of a bar not to serve liquor to a minor. \\n   Mr. President, last week I submitted evidence to the Commerce Committee, which I think is strongly suggestive of the fact that two major entertainment industries--the movies and the video games--are rating products as bad for our children and then, as my colleagues have shown here on the floor, directly marketing those products to our children, contributing to the culture of violence that is embracing, surrounding, suffocating, and too often motivating our kids. \\n   This amendment rightfully calls on the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission to conduct an investigation of the marketing practices of the video game, music, and motion picture industries to determine if they engage in deceptive marketing practices by targeting minors for the acquisition of material they themselves have deemed unsuitable for such minors. \\n   I am afraid to say that Joe Camel has not gone away. He seems too often to have gone into the entertainment business. \\n   Consider the anecdotal evidence from the movie industry, which indicates that violent films rated for adults only are being marketed to children. Over the last few years we have seen the rise of a new class of teen-targeted films--referred to by some as ``teensploitation\\'\\' movies--which has engaged producers and directors in a conspicuous contest to see who can be more violent, more sexually provocative, and generally more perverse to attract youth audiences. A perfect example of this trend is ``Very Bad Things,\\'\\' a supposed comedy about a bachelor party gone wrong, which finds fun in the dismembering of a stripper and the successive mutilation of the partygoers. \\n   The latest entry is ``Idle Hands,\\'\\' which was released just last week. It is promoted as ``sick and twisted laugh riot,\\'\\' and it\\'s not hard to see where this description comes from--according to reviews, the film features a severed hand that fondles a girl before strangling her, a knitting needle that is driven through a policeman\\'s ear, and a decapitation by circular saw blade, all apparently played for laughs. \\n   What these movies have in common, beyond their violent and offensive content, is that they are rated ``R,\\'\\' meaning that they are not meant for children under 17. Yet according to several recent news media reports, most producers and studio executives assume that underage kids can and will get in. ``Well, let\\'s hope so,\\'\\' says Roger Kumble, the director of ``Cruel Intentions,\\'\\' the teen remake of ``Dangerous Liaisons\\'\\' which is by all accounts far more salacious than the original. This sentiment was affirmed by Don Mancini, the writer of all four R-rated ``Child\\'s Play\\'\\' horror films, who acknowledged that young teens were the target for his most recent release, ``Bride of Chucky,\\'\\' and other similarly bloody slasher films. ``They have grown up watching these movies on home video,\\'\\' he said. ``Now that there are new ones coming out, these kids are tantalized.\\'\\' \\n   To apparently help lure in young audiences, these teensploitation movies are heavily advertised on MTV and network series that teens watch regularly, such as ``Dawson\\'s Creek\\'\\' and ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,\\'\\' and are stocked with actors from these teen-favored TV shows. This pattern succeeded with the teen slasher movies ``Scream\\'\\' and ``I Know What You Did Last Summer,\\'\\' and it continues with the current ``Cruel Intentions\\'\\'--the director said casting Sarah Michelle Gellar of Buffy fame was like ``dangling the carrot\\'\\' in front of young teens. This dangling is apparently working--according to a recent Gallup poll, half of American teens say they have seen an ``R\\'\\'-rated movie in the last month, including 42 percent of those aged 13-15. \\n   The video and PC and arcade gamemakers are less candid about targeting their marketing to teens than the moviemakers, but the evidence is there just the same. Action figures based on bloodthirsty characters from ``Resident Evil 2,\\'\\' ``Duke Nukem,\\'\\' and  ``Mortal Kombat\\'\\'--three heavily-violent titles that are rated ``M\\'\\' for 17-and-up--are being sold at Toys-R-Us and similar toy stores. Those same toy stores, which cater largely to children, typically carry those games and many of ``M\\'\\'-rated titles filled with guns and gore. \\n   Equally disturbing is the advertising that publishers place in the various glossy game-player magazines. These magazines are widely read by young gamers, and they are filled with perverse and antisocial messages. Here are just a few: ``Carmageddon\\'\\' boasts it is ``as easy as killing babies with axes\\'\\'; ``Point Blanks\\'\\' claims it is ``more fun than shooting your neighbor\\'s cat\\'\\'; ``Die by the Sword\\'\\' instructs, ``Escape. Dismember. Massacre.\\'\\'; and ``Cardinal Syn\\'\\' features a severed, bloodied head on top of a spear, with the tag line, ``Happiness is a Warm Cranium.\\'\\' A good indication these messages are reaching their target audience came from a survey done by the national Institute on Media and the Family last winter, which found that while only five percent of parents were familiar with the game ``Duke Nukem,\\'\\' 80 percent of junior high students knew of it. \\n   Taken together, the evidence here is enough to demonstrate that there is a troubling trend in the entertainment industry, one that it needs to stop now. The marketing of these ever-more vicious and violent products is making a mockery of the various rating systems, telling parents that these products are inappropriate for children but we\\'re going to sell them anyway, and reminding us of similar behavior by the tobacco industry. More than that, it is unethical and unacceptable, and should stop now. \\n   We presented this evidence at a hearing before the Commerce Committee earlier this month, and the response from Hollywood was a deafening silence. There was no acknowledgment that this is going on, or even that it presents a problem. Their unwillingness to discuss this problem leaves us no chance to act. That is why Senator HATCH and I, along with Senator BROWNBACK, are calling for an investigation into the marketing practices of the movie, music and video game industries, to determine to what extent they are targeting ultraviolent, adult-rated products to children. \\n   Finally, in this amendment we call for an NIH study on violent entertainment. NIH is directed to conduct a study of the effect of violence in video games and music, building on the studies that have been done which conclusively show that violence in movies and television affects the behavior of children and makes them more violent. \\n   This study would be a companion piece to the directive the President issued on Monday at the summit. He called on the Surgeon General to do a broad-based study of the causes of youth violence in our country, including the effect the entertainment industry is having on the violent behavior of our children. \\n   This amendment is one of several that will be introduced today. None of them individually will solve this problem. This is all a matter which in some ways is the history of human civilization and the extent to which we can improve the prospect that we will express our better natures and not our worst natures. As humans, we are far from perfect. Parents try to raise children and develop their better nature. Too often today those parents feel as if they are in fundamental and in some ways critical competition with the entertainment industry to raise their kids. \\n   All we are doing in these amendments and these statements is to appeal to the entertainment industry to exercise some responsibility: Help America raise our children so that society will be safer than I fear it is as a result of the violent material included in too many entertainment products. \\n   I hope--and I say this with some confidence based on the bipartisan reach of the cosponsors of this amendment--Senators BROWNBACK, HATCH, MCCAIN, KOHL, and myself at least--that this amendment will be passed across party lines with an overwhelming majority of colleagues of the Senate voting in favor of it. \\n   I yield the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990511\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, three weeks after the tragic shooting in Littleton, Colorado, we as a national community are still struggling to make sense of this horrific event and the other school massacres that preceded it. We are still searching for reasons why some of our children are slaughtering each other, and why there is generally so much violence surrounding our young people, not just in classrooms and schoolyards but on streetcorners and in homes across the country. \\n   In this discussion, we have heard many factors cited as possible causes, but few definitive conclusions or little consensus on exactly what or who is responsible for this alarming trend. In fact, one of the only things that most Americans seem to agree on is that this is an extremely complicated problem, and that there is not any one answer. They are right. \\n   The search for common ground and common solutions began in earnest yesterday with the summit meeting the President convened at the White House. At that meeting the President opened a much-needed dialogue with the entertainment and gun industries, yielding some important commitments from the gun makers, but little if anything from the entertainment industry. The President also laid out a promising plan for translating this conversation into action, calling for a national campaign to change the pervading culture of violence, to mobilize a sustained response to this threat from every segment of our society, much as we have done in the fight against teen pregnancy. \\n   We are here today to introduce legislation that we believe can make an important contribution to this national campaign, something that will help us better understand as we prepare to act. Our proposal would create a select national commission on youth violence, whose mandate would be to deliberately and dispassionately examine the many possible root causes of this crisis of youth violence, to help us understand why so many kids are turning into killers, and to help us reach consensus on how to curtail this recurring nightmare. \\n   This commission would be composed of a wide array of experts in the fields of law enforcement, school administration, teaching and counseling, parenting and family studies, and child and adolescent psychology, as well as Cabinet members and national religious leaders, to thoroughly study the different dimensions of this problem. After deliberating for a year, the commission would be directed to report its conclusions to the President and Congress and recommend a series of tangible steps we could take to reduce the level of youth violence and prevent other families and communities from feeling the searing pain and grief that has visited the people of Littleton for the last three weeks. \\n   Our proposal is not intended to forestall or preempt a more immediate response to what happened in Littleton. To the contrary, we each believe there are several steps that the Congress and different groups and industries could and should take now that would help us reduce not just the risk of another school massacre, but the daily death toll of youth violence across America. Several of us here, for example, have and will continue to push the entertainment industry to stop glorifying and romanticizing violence, and in particular to stop marketing murder and mayhem directly to kids.  \\n   But we also believe that this extraordinary problem is not something that we can solve overnight, or with any single piece of legislation. A commission is no guarantee that we will find all the answers and bridge all the divisions, but we believe it provides as good a hope as any for thoughtfully doing so, and for making this national campaign a success. \\n   In the coming days, we will offer this proposal as an amendment to the juvenile justice bill. We will also be putting forward a companion amendment calling for a Surgeon General\\'s report on the public health aspects of the youth violence epidemic, with a particular focus on the contributing effects of entertainment media violence on children. This proposal, which the President endorsed at Monday\\'s summit, is intended to inform the commission\\'s work and hopefully raise public awareness of the enormous role the entertainment culture plays in shaping the world our sons and daughters inhabit. \\n   I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed into the RECORD. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990504\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators DOMENICI and BINGAMAN today in supporting the Private Sector Research and Development Investment Act of 1999. This bill recognizes that we are moving toward a New Economy and supports the engine of that New Economy. Let me explain. \\n   In this decade, we have returned to our nation\\'s historic growth rate of 3% plus growth. We haven\\'t seen this in 30 years, but now we are back there again. We know what the last few years of growth feel like--America is starting to feel like an opportunity society again. We are moving toward some fundamental changes in our economic structure, toward a knowledge-based economy and further away from a resource-based economy. Key to these high growth rates has been overall productivity gains that are back in the 2% range, which has enabled the United States to experience real growth and real growth in incomes without significant inflation. A significant part of our productivity gains have come from gains in manufacturing productivity, which has approached 4% in each of the past three years. These manufacturing gains come directly from innovation, and in recent years these are largely driven by innovation in information technology--one of the most amazing results of R&D in this century from the invention of the transistor over 50 years ago to the development of the Internet today. And it looks like we are starting to get noticeable productivity gains in our services sector as well, also driven by information technology. The digital revolution is affecting every sector of our economy. As Andy Grove, Chairman of Intel, said, ``In five years, there will be no Internet companies. Every company will be an Internet company,\\'\\' or it won\\'t be in business. \\n   Some analysts look at the stock market today and compare it to the 1600\\'s Dutch tulip bulbs investment bubble, maybe the largest bubble of all time, and its subsequent crash. The difference is that tulip bulbs did not fundamentally alter the means of communication and increase productivity as the Internet does. \\n   Pharmaceuticals and health care is another area in which our country\\'s investment in R&D has catapulted us above our competitors. A recent study from the Department of Commerce found that the United States is decades ahead of other countries in the pharmaceutical and health related industries directly because of our investment in R&D. In the past 50 years, researchers from U.S. pharmaceutical companies have discovered and developed breakthrough treatments for asthma, heart disease, osteoporosis, HIV/AIDS, stroke, ulcers, and glaucoma. And they have developed vaccines against previously common causes of infant death including polio, rubella, influenza B and whooping cough. Why is the U.S. pharmaceutical industry the number one global innovator in medicine? According to Raymond Gilmartin, Chairman, President and CEO of Merck & Co., because ``The U.S. pharmaceutical industry leads the world in its commitment to research.....\\'\\' \\n   There have been at least a dozen major economic studies, including those of Nobel Prize winner Robert Solow, which conclude that technological progress accounts for 50%, and lately considerable more, of our total growth and has twice the impact on economic growth as labor or capital. For the long term health of our economy, we need to invest now in activities that will have a future payoff in innovation and productivity. A one percent increase in our nation\\'s investment in research results in a productivity increase of 0.23%. We need to ensure our future by creating the institutions and incentives to increase R&D investment in the United States. This Act will replace our current, dysfunctional system of on-again, off-again R&D tax credits with a tax credit that is reliably permanent. In the global economy we will have to not only out-perform our competitors, but out-innovate them. Giving our industry the tools to support their own innovation is a timely act. \\n   This Act meets the goals of some groups who favor simply making the credit permanent and increasing the alternative credit by one percent, as does  the bill introduced by my esteemed colleague Senator HATCH. I am a cosponsor of Senator HATCH\\'s bill. I believe we need to make the R&D credit permanent. But I feel strongly that we need further changes to the Act to increase its effectiveness, make it more accessible to small and start up businesses, update the credit to account for changes we are seeing in industry and, importantly, to complement the relationship between Federal and private sector research. The bill that Senators DOMENICI, BINGAMAN, FRIST, SNOWE, and myself are introducing makes these important changes, as well as making the R&D tax credit permanent. \\n   Industry research is largely dependent on the basic research undertaken by the Federal government. Because industry itself does not perform basic research--84% of industry research is concentrated on product development, the final stage of R&D--the private sector must draw on government-funded research to develop ideas for new market products. Of all papers cited in U.S. industry patents, 73% are from government and non-profit funded research. This marriage of basic Federal research and applied private research is essential. Yet, as a percent of GDP, Federal investment in R&D has been nearly halved over the last 30 years. We are living off of the fruits of basic research from the mid-1960s. In addition, the national labs and universities are facing a brain drain by the private sector as engineers and scientists are in high demand and increasingly in short supply. The private sector recognizes the importance of work accomplished through Federal funding and knows this is a problem that needs to be addressed. This bill encourages collaboration between private sector research and national labs and universities and offers a financial incentive to use the national labs and universities. Specifically, the Act encourages industry to use the federally funded programs by qualifying 100% of contract research accomplished at universities, national labs, and small businesses. It also enables basic research at Federally Funded R&D Centers to count toward the basic research credit. By expanding the credit to research done in consortia, the Act also recognizes that research today is more often done in collaboration than in isolation. \\n   The fastest method of moving research into the marketplace is often through small, startup companies. The Act updates the tax credit rules to accommodate the special R&D cycles faced by these companies. By supporting the small but crucial R&D efforts of new technology-based firms, the Act nurtures the very companies who contribute disproportionately to our national productivity and employment growth. \\n   The Act also updates our view of R&D. For the alternative credit, it calculates R&D expenditures with respect to a rolling baseline, rather than a fixed 1980\\'s baseline that is increasingly remote and outdated as time passes. \\n   Mr. President, I believe there has been a growing awareness among Senators over the past couple of years that technology has been one of the driving forces behind our fantastic economic growth in this country. Despite that we are finally out of the red on the budget and finally in the black, we know that continued control and restraint must be exercised on the budget and we will have to make difficult choices about what programs to fund and what tax cuts to make. But now that we know that technological progress is responsible for 50% or more of economic growth, I think we owe it to ourselves to encourage such progress whenever possible. It is an investment in our future which we cannot do without. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990503\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I have been privileged to join with the Senator from Arizona, the Senator from Delaware and others, in cosponsoring this resolution. So I have listened with considerable personal interest as one after another of our colleagues have expressed their points of view. I joined with Senator MCCAIN and Senator BIDEN and the others in cosponsoring this resolution as a way to express my personal support, and hopefully on a bipartisan basis--and the cosponsors of this resolution are a broad and bipartisan group--to give the Senate an opportunity to express our support for the objectives that NATO has adopted in entering the conflict in the Balkans and that the United States and this administration have, of course, subscribed to. Let me read what those objectives are:  \\n   That the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, (Serbia and Montenegro).......withdraw its military, paramilitary and security forces from the province of Kosovo, [that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] allow the return of ethnic Albanian refugees to their homes, and [that Serbia] permit the establishment of a NATO-led peacekeeping force in Kosovo.  \\n   In light of all the blood that has been spilled, in light of the horrific scenes that we have all not just heard about, not just heard rumored, not heard speculated about, but seen with our own eyes on television, heard the eye-witness reports on television; of all the horrors that we have been forced to witness again that have occurred in Kosovo--when we think of all of those objectives of the NATO campaign, the NATO effort, the NATO war in the Balkans, they are extremely reasonable and extremely just. \\n   So I joined with my colleagues in offering this resolution as a way to restate clearly and simply what our objectives are here and to say that we want to support the President of the United States. We want to support the President of the United States in the decision he has made to join with our allies in NATO to carry out this cause. We want to say by this resolution, so strongly do we believe in this cause, that we are prepared to give this President, as the resolution says, authorization ``to use all necessary force and other means, in concert with the United States allies, to accomplish United States and NATO objectives,\\'\\' that I have just described. \\n   To me, it is an opportunity, broad-based, simple, fair, direct, not just to stand together on a bipartisan basis in this Senate, but to stand together in support of the policy that this administration has adopted in support of our NATO allies and, in doing so, to send a message to the enemy, to Mr. Milosevic--who we are reliably informed began this invasion of Kosovo, this massacre, this massive expulsion, as others have said before me tonight and earlier today, based on the ethnic history, identity and religion of the people being expelled--to say to Mr. Milosevic, who, again, we are reliably informed, began his evil deeds in Kosovo with the hope and the belief that the NATO allies would soon break their cohesiveness, would not hold in the face of this onslaught and his clever diplomatic moves, he was wrong. \\n   The NATO allies were here just a week ago. They spoke with unity. They strengthened their ranks. They came together. They agreed to intensify the effort against Milosevic and they have done so in the ensuing week. Those of us who have brought this resolution before the Senate have done so with the hope that we might also make clear to Milosevic that the other belief \\n   he had, that he could divide the American people and their Representatives here in Congress, was false. It was in vain. It was folly. \\n   That is the spirit in which this resolution was offered. I have listened to my colleagues speak, and, as others who have spoken before me, it seems clear to me the motion to table this resolution will be agreed to tomorrow. I have heard three or four different reasons given for that. I would say the majority of reasons are procedural, and I understand those. They are not substantive. They do not go to the heart of the policy that we, the sponsors of this resolution, have intended to convey. Some of my colleagues have said the resolution is not needed; it is premature. \\n   What NATO is doing now is carrying out the aerial bombardment of Serbia and military sites in Kosovo. The Senate has already authorized that, to our great credit, on a bipartisan basis. Almost 60 percent of the Senate voted almost a month ago, as the air campaign began, to authorize and support, if you will, the President and NATO in that effort--that valiant effort, that effort that has been conducted by the men and women in uniform for all the NATO countries and for ourselves. I am proud to cite the tremendous courage and skill with which our military personnel have carried out that effort. The Senate distinguished itself in support of that effort. Unfortunately, the House did not do so last week and sent a mixed signal. But I understand some of my colleagues have said tonight the Senate has already spoken on the military effort that is part of this battle against Milosevic, so we need not speak now in more width or depth. \\n   What others have said--the second reason I can hear--is that the President is not asking for this authorization. In fact, since we introduced this resolution, S.J. Res. 20, the President has indicated both at meetings in the White House with a broad, bipartisan group of Senators, and publicly, if it came to a point, which he hopes and believes we will not reach--and of course we all hope we will not reach--when it became clear, tragically, that the Milosevic leadership in Serbia was remaining what I would describe as insanely intransigent in the face of a devastating air campaign against that country--which some experts say, analysts say has already set back the Serbian economy a decade, some say even more--if Milosevic remained intransigent, the President has said, and he was forced to reconsider the statement he has made that he does not believe  we need to employ ground forces there, that he would come to Congress and ask for our consent. So I understand some of our colleagues have said, therefore, that this resolution is premature. \\n   There are others, and I hope and believe, as I will say a little bit later on, that they are in the minority here, who do not support this effort at all, who want to see us negotiate a settlement or, worse, negotiate a settlement with a regime that has blood on its hands, that has violated the values that we hold dear, the humanitarian values, as we have all seen. We know what is happening. This is a regime in Belgrade that has carried out aggression, that has aimed at destabilizing Europe; a regime that, over the last decade, successively has invaded Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, and now Kosovo. \\n   This is a regime that, evidence leads us to conclude, by its policies has brought about the death of hundreds of thousands of people. That is what this is about: Destabilization, aggression, ethnic cleansing and genocide in Europe at the end of this century, challenging the premise that brought about the creation of NATO 50 years ago, which was not just to defend against a Soviet invasion of Western Europe, but was to uphold the principles for which the then recently completed Second World War was fought, which were freedom, human dignity, democracy. Sometimes, as I watch the slaughter continuing, the expulsions continuing in Kosovo, as I think of the history of Serbia and Milosevic for these last 10 years, I just say to myself: Have we not learned the lessons of this century, of the last 60 years of this century? \\n   Why did we fight the Second World War and the cold war if not to establish the principle that it was in America\\'s security interest and, of course, even more intensely and intimately in the security interest and the principal interest of our allies in Europe not to allow tyranny, brutality, communism to exist in Europe? It threatened the stability of that great region with which we have historic ties, with which we have extraordinary economic ties, which contains the heart of our alliance, the strength of the partners we would turn to, not just when in crisis in Europe, but when in crisis anywhere in the world, as we did in the gulf war. Whom did we ask to stand by our fight, to fight by our side? Our allies in Europe, first and most significantly. \\n   Will we allow this century to end having fought the Second World War, made vivid in the Spielberg movie, ``Saving Private Ryan\\'\\'--did those Americans fight that extraordinary fight with that unbelievable courage, lose their lives, so that a dictator, bent on the same kind of aggression and ethnic genocide at the end of the century, would be allowed to work his evil will in Europe? \\n   Did we spend billions of dollars and stand face to face with Communist tyranny for the long years of the cold war, did President Reagan lead us to the great final victories in the cold war, so less than a decade later we would allow a Communist--what is Milosevic? He is an unreconstructed Communist dictator--that we would allow a Communist dictator to work his will in the heart of Europe and in the backyard of NATO, that we would stand by and do nothing? I hope not. \\n   I take issue respectfully on the merits, as I see them, with those who oppose this resolution because they do not think we should be involved. But I understand those who say, as my colleague from Illinois said a moment ago, that the Senate is not ready to make the statement contained in this resolution. \\n   As a cosponsor of this resolution, as one who worked with Senator MCCAIN, Senator BIDEN, and others to fashion this resolution, I have already made the statement, I have already come to the conclusion, so I will stand with all of my colleagues who have cosponsored this resolution and whom I heard speak up to now on this debate, who say they will oppose the motion to table. \\n   We are ready to vote, and we will vote tomorrow morning against the tabling of this resolution. We will vote against the tabling of the resolution with the confidence that if the President is wrong and the air campaign does not bring this war to an end, not on any weakened terms, but on the terms we clearly state in this resolution--the Serbs out, the Kosovars back in to live in peace, and an international peacekeeping force there--then we will return. \\n   Those who have said that they are not prepared now to vote for this resolution, those who have said this is merely a procedural vote--and I understand that--those who are essentially voting to table not because they are against, as I hear them speak, the substance of this resolution---- \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-2-19990503\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator. \\n   I am confident if that day comes--and, of course, I hope it does not come. But if we are not able to achieve the victory we must have here, that NATO must have to remain credible, the \\n   United States must have to remain credible, that we must achieve so that all the bullies, the thugs and the dictators, wherever they may be--in Asia, the Middle East or anywhere else--will not see an opportunity to take advantage of us, if we return at that point to the Senate and ask for support for the next necessary means to achieve our objectives, I am confident that on that day a bipartisan majority in the Senate will not walk away from the field of battle with the enemy having achieved the victory, will not yield to the forces of ethnic cleansing and ethnic slaughter and ethnic expulsion but will stand together, united across party lines, to support our soldiers in uniform, yes, indeed, our NATO allies, of course, to support the principles upon which this country was founded, which are at stake in Kosovo today, and to support the administration in the full conduct of this effort. \\n   This is one of those defining moments. Tomorrow\\'s vote is not the defining moment. Tomorrow\\'s vote is, if you will, an early round in the debate in which a majority of Members are not prepared to vote for this resolution. If necessary, I am convinced on another day that they will, and I am convinced that that is very much in the national security interest and in the national moral interest of the United States of America. \\n   I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990429\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I would like to add my strong support to the bill we are currently considering, the Y2K Act. Although I plan to join my colleagues on this side of the aisle in voting against cloture, I don\\'t want anyone to construe that vote as an indication that I have any doubts about the need for, and the wisdom of, this legislation. \\n   Congress needs to act to address the probable explosion of litigation over the Y2K problem, and it needs to act now. We are all familiar with the problem caused by the Y2K bug. Although no one can predict with certainty what will happen next year, there is little doubt that there will be computer program failures, possibly on a large scale, and that those failures could bring both minor inconveniences and significant disruptions in our lives. This could pose a serious challenge to our economy, and if there are wide spread failures, American businesses will need to focus on how they can continue providing the goods and services we all rely on in the face of disruptions. \\n   Just as importantly, the Y2K problem will present a unique challenge to our court system--unique because of the likely massive volume of litigation that will result and because of the fact that that litigation will commence within a span of a few months, potentially flooding the courts with cases and inundating American companies with lawsuits at the precise time they need to devote their resources to fixing the problem. I think it is appropriate for Congress to act now to ensure that our legal system is prepared to deal efficiently, fairly and effectively with the Y2K problem--to make sure that those problems that can be solved short of litigation will be, to make sure that companies that should be held liable for their actions will be held liable, but to also make sure that the Y2K problem does not just become an opportunity for a few enterprising individuals to profit from frivolous litigation, unfairly wasting the resources of companies that have done nothing wrong or diverting the resources of companies that should be devoting themselves to fixing the problem. \\n   To that end, I have worked extensively with the sponsors of this legislation--with Senators MCCAIN, GORTON, WYDEN, DODD, HATCH, FEINSTEIN and others--to try to craft targeted legislation that will address the Y2K problem. Like many others here, I was uncomfortable with the breadth of the initial draft of this legislation. I took those concerns to the bill\\'s sponsors, and together, we worked out my concerns. I thank them for that. With the addition of the amendment just agreed to by Senators DODD, MCCAIN and others, I think we have a package of which we all can be proud, one which will help us fairly manage Y2K litigation. Provisions like the one requiring notice before filing a lawsuit will help save the resources of our court system while giving parties the opportunity to work out their problems before incurring the cost of litigation and the hardening of positions the filing of a lawsuit often brings. The requirement that defects be material for a class action to be brought will allow recovery for those  defects that are of consequence while keeping those with no real injury from using the court system to extort settlements out of companies that have done them no real harm. And the provision keeping plaintiffs with contractual relationships with defendants from seeking through tort actions damages that their contracts don\\'t allow them to get will make sure that settled business expectations are honored and that plaintiffs get precisely--but not more than--the damages they are entitled to. \\n   I think it is critical for everyone to recognize that the bill we have before us today is not the bill that Senator MCCAIN first introduced or that was reported out of the Commerce Committee. Because of the efforts of the many of us interested in seeing legislation move, the bill has been significantly narrowed. For example, a number of the provisions changing substantive state tort law have been dropped. Provisions offering a new ``reasonable efforts\\'\\' defense have been dropped. The punitive damages section has been altered. And, instead of a complete elimination of joint liability, we now have a bill that holds those who committed intentional fraud fully jointly liable, that offers full compensation to plaintiffs with small net worths and that allows partial joint liability against a defendant when its co-defendants are judgment proof--precisely what most of us voted for in the context of securities litigation reform. \\n   I understand that there are those who still have concerns about some of the remaining provisions in the bill. To them and to the bill\\'s supporters, I offer what has become a cliche around here, but has done so because it is truly a wise piece of advice: let us not make the perfect the enemy of the good. Y2K liability reform is necessary--in fact critical--legislation that we must enact. Those of us supporting the legislation must be open to reasonable changes necessary to make the bill move, and those with legitimate concerns about the bill need to work with us to help address them. I hope we can all work together to get this done. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990428\\n\\n    Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, with the economy in its 9th year of record growth, unemployment the lowest its been in over 25 years, and the stock market at an all time high, the following is worth noting: \\n   Fully a third of all American households have no financial assets to speak of. \\n   Another 20 percent have only negligible financial assets. \\n   Almost half of all American children live in households that have no financial assets. \\n   Over 10 million Americans don\\'t even have a bank account. \\n   In our efforts to foster policies that encourage economic growth, we have not done enough for the group that needs it the most--hardworking low income Americans. We have established tax credits for retirement plans, for home mortgages, for college education, and so on, all of which make for good policy. The problem is that to take advantage of these policies, you must already have some wealth. You must already have some assets. To put it plainly, you cannot benefit from a home mortgage credit if you do not have the wealth to buy a home. \\n   So the challenge becomes creating a policy that helps low-income Americans reach the point where they can take advantage of these benefits. Any such policy must start with encouraging saving. Saving is empowering. It allows families to weather the bad times, to live without aid, and to deal with emergencies. Saving is also the first step to building assets. \\n   And having assets is a prerequisite for taking part in this economy. That is because assets offer a way up. Whether it is a home, an education, or a small business, assets can be leveraged to deal with the bad times and usher in the good. That is why I believe that our tax policies should provide more incentives for asset building. \\n   So Mr. President today along with Senators SANTORUM, DURBIN, ABRAHAM, ROBB, and KERREY of Nebraska, I offer tax legislation aimed at building assets for low-income families. The Savings for Working Families Act is centered around Individual Development Accounts (IDAs), an idea of Dr. Michael Sherraden of Washington University: create a savings account for low income workers that can be used to acquire assets, and allow the saver to receive matching funds towards the purchase of those assets. \\n   The Savings for Working Families Act allows for the creation by federally insured banks and credit unions of IDAs for U.S. citizens or legal residents aged 18 or over, with a household income of not more than 60 percent of area median income, and a household net worth that does not exceed $10,000 excluding home equity and the value of one car. \\n   The federal government will provide tax credits of up to $300 per account to financial institutions to reimburse them for providing matching funds for IDAs. All other sources of matching funds are welcome as well, including employers, charitable organizations, and the banks themselves. \\n   Before an individual can use money from an IDA, he or she must complete an economic literacy course that will be offered by participating banks and community organizations. The course will teach about saving, banking, investing, and IDAs. Two years from its establishment the Act requires the Secretary of the Treasury to review the program for its cost-effectiveness and make recommendations as necessary to the Congress. We expect a cost of $200-500 million per year. \\n   This is not a handout. Because only earned income is matched, IDAs only help those who are already trying to help themselves. Small IDA programs already exist across the country and have been overwhelmingly successfully. IDAs change the outlook of the saver. When you have assets, you have a stake in the economy, and you act to protect that stake. \\n   For example, in Stamford, Connecticut a receptionist named Scharlene is saving to start her own business through the CTE IDA program. She had always thought of her interest in jewelry as a hobby. But after working with CTE IDA program she has not only saved over $700, but has also learned the basics of running a business. I met Scharlene, and I can tell you that win or lose, she is on the path to success. I might also add that the Connecticut State Treasurer, Ms. Denise Nappier, is also investigating ways to set up a state-side IDA program, and I would like to commend her for her efforts. \\n   In the Sierra Ridge, Texas IDA program describes the case of Charles, a 38 year old divorced father of two. He uses that IDA program to save money for his children\\'s education. Charles says that since he entered the program he thinks more about where his money goes: ``Having to commit to a long term goal makes us more aware that our decisions today could have consequences for tomorrow.\\'\\' His oldest daughter is planning on attending college in two years. \\n   Another example comes from a Bonneville, Kentucky IDA program. There, Pam, a 37 year old factory worker and mother of two, has been saving to start her own business. ``I want to start a business and I will,\\'\\' Pam said. Together with the matching funds she has saved over $1700 towards a combination dry cleaners/video store. Her reasons are simple: ``I want more for my children.\\'\\' \\n   IDAs are good for business too. Financial institutions like IDAs because they bring some of the 10 million ``unbanked\\'\\' Americans into the system, and because it allows them to support low-income communities in a way that will ultimately be profitable for them. This is an idea that gives the right incentives to a deserving group in an effective and efficient manner. It is an idea that represents at once both our support of equal opportunity and our emphasis on self reliance. It is an idea whose time has come. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990422\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President. I rise today to express my strong opposition to Senator DOMENICI\\'s amendment ``The Social Security Surplus Preservation and Debt Reduction Act\\'\\'. I supported the original legislation, S. 557, which was reported out of the Committee on Governmental Affairs, and would have provided guidance for the designation of emergencies. But this amendment uses S. 557 as a vehicle to introduce a highly controversial and partisan proposal on Social Security. It also changes an important provision in the original bill regarding emergency designations, in a way that undermines the bipartisan compromise which we had reached in Committee. As Ranking Democrat of the Committee on Governmental Affairs, I will limit my comments to the bill we reported out of committee, and to the reasons I object to the changes made to those emergency designation provisions. \\n   First, I would like to provide some background about why I support the unamended version of S. 557, and how it came to be reported out of the Governmental Affairs Committee. Passed in 1990, the Budget Enforcement Act requires that the cost of appropriations legislation stay within spending caps and that the cost of all other legislation satisfies the ``pay-as-you-go\\'\\' requirements. At the time the bill was passed, however, there was a legitimate concern that these new limits on spending could impede Congress\\' ability to provide additional funds for emergencies. As a result, Congress provided that if the President designates a provision as an emergency requirement and the Congress agrees in legislation, then the spending caps and ``pay-go\\'\\' limitations do not apply to that provision. Congress did not provide any guidance regarding what constitutes an emergency. \\n   Not counting 1991, when emergency spending spiked because of the Persian Gulf War, the annual emergency expenditure had ranged from $16 billion to $5 billion before last year\\'s Omnibus spending legislation set a new record, at $21.5 billion. The emergency spending designation has been used appropriately in many cases. Every year money is provided to the Federal Emergency Management Agency to respond to natural disasters such as hurricanes and floods. Emergency spending has included military funding for Operation Desert Storm and for peacekeeping efforts in Bosnia. The emergency designation has also been used to provide funds after other cataclysmic domestic events, such as the riots in Los Angeles in 1992 and the terrorist bombing in Oklahoma City in 1995. The 1999 emergency funds addressed a wider variety of needs than in prior years. According to the Congressional Budget Office, last year emergency funds were used for the first time for increased security at U.S. embassies, for price supports for U.S. farmers, to respond to the Year 2000 Computer problem, for counter-drug and drug interdiction efforts, for ballistic missile defense enhancements, and to address funding shortfalls in the defense health program, among other things. \\n   While these expenses may all be legitimate uses of tax dollars, Senators on both sides of the aisle feel that some of the past designations of emergency spending were inappropriate, and have been looking for a statutory solution. The problem is the complete absence of guidelines on what constitutes an emergency, as well as insufficient procedural safeguards to prevent the misuse of the subjective emergency designation. \\n   The provision on emergency spending originally contained in Senator DOMENICI\\'s ``Budget Enforcement Act of 1999\\'\\' addressed this problem by establishing a 60-vote point of order against any emergency spending provision contained in a bill, amendment, or conference report. A number of Senators in the Committee on Governmental Affairs, myself included, felt that the super-majority point of order was neither necessary nor appropriate. It would have trampled on the rights of the Minority, and might have led to scenarios where aid is held up in cases of regional emergencies, particularly if a determined bloc of senators hoped to extract some unrelated legislative concession in return for the release of funds. We have seen cases where floods have ravaged the river valleys of the Dakotas, or tornadoes have decimated swaths of countryside in just one or two rural states. Severe droughts are emergencies to the farmers suffering their long-term effects, but may not seem quite so urgent to Senators representing other states. Allowing a reticent voting bloc to hold up funding for emergencies that are recognized by both the President and a majority of Senators seems to be an extreme measure to take, before having attempted a more measured response. \\n   Accordingly, I was quite pleased when we were able to work out an agreement with Senator DOMENICI and Chairman THOMPSON regarding emergency spending. Our compromise preserved the point of order against all emergency spending, but converted it from a super-majority point of order to a simple majority point of order. The agreement retained criteria defining what constitutes an emergency. \\n   The bill we reported out frames the debate whenever an emergency expenditure is challenged. The bill requires the President and congressional committees to analyze whether a proposed emergency funding requirement is necessary, sudden, urgent, unforeseen, and not permanent. If a proposed requirement does not meet one of these five criteria, the President or committee must justify in writing why the requirement still constitutes an emergency. Although the five criteria are not binding, the existence of this new statutory guidance, along with the explanations that may be contained in any accompanying report, will provide an essential framework for emergency spending designation decisions that has heretofore been lacking. A Senator raising a point of order against an emergency spending designation would have codified criteria to point to, and the process contained in this legislation encourages more challenges of abuses of the emergency spending designation. \\n   After our bipartisan bill was reported to the full Senate, Senator DOMENICI included in his budget resolution a 60-vote point of order against any emergency designation. During the ensuing consideration of the resolution, Senators DURBIN, BYRD and I co-sponsored an amendment bringing back the simple-majority point of order. Senator DOMENICI accepted this amendment rather than hold a roll-call vote; nevertheless, our measure was subsequently stripped out in Conference. Accordingly, for the next year we will be governed by a Senate rule which requires a super-majority to designate emergencies, a rule which has not won the approval of even a simple majority of any Senate body. \\n   Now we have before us an amendment that goes even further than the provision contained in the budget resolution. The amendment would re-establish the 60-vote point of order against emergency designations which had been removed by consensus in the committee. This point of order would last for ten years, and it would be codified rather than be a Senate rule. For reasons that are not clear, there would be an exception for Defense emergencies, but not for any other type of emergency, including natural disasters. \\n   Importantly, the amended point of order applies to the emergency designation and not the spending itself. If it is raised and sustained, the bill\\'s spending for scoring purposes would be increased, thereby potentially causing it to exceed its allocation. That would leave the entire bill vulnerable to a second point of order. This potential for procedural logjams would only complicate Congress\\' efforts to provide adequate funding to cope with real and pressing emergencies. \\n   Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to reject the amendment to S. 557, and to accept instead the bill originally reported out of Committee, which addresses the issue of emergency designations in a sensible way, and which has won the support of members of both parties in the Committee. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990422\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am proud to again join with Senator ROTH in the very important bipartisan effort to designate the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as wilderness--forever. \\n   Today is Earth Day 1999. The introduction of the Arctic Wilderness Act is particularly appropriate on Earth Day because it will provide permanent protection for the unique and irreplaceable natural resources of an area that is the ``biological heart\\'\\' of the North Slope of Alaska. The coastal plain is a vital part of the tundra ecosystem that some have referred to as ``America\\'s Serengetti.\\'\\' \\n   On Earth Day, we should take extra measure of special, rare, and threatened places. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge coastal plain is one of these places. It is one natural treasure that we must protect as wilderness for current and future generations. \\n   The coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife refuge represents the wildest and most pristine arctic coastal ecosystem in the United States. The coastal plain is where the calves of the awe-inspiring Porcupine caribou herd are born every year. It is also where snow geese feed in the fall and many female polar bears choose to den. \\n   During the summer, migratory birds such as the red-throated loon, American golden-plover, and semipalmated sandpiper and others flock to the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in great numbers. In the fall, they return southward to and through the state of Connecticut among other places. By dedicating the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as wilderness, we can help ensure that this ancient natural rite continues into the 21st Century. \\n   For more than a decade, Congress has repeatedly debated the advisability of opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge coastal plain to oil and gas exploration and development. Time and again, Congress and the American people have rejected the notion that we should sacrifice our last vestige of arctic coastal plain to petroleum development. The decision to prohibit coastal plain petroleum development reflects the tremendous value Americans place in the preservation of our great wilderness areas. \\n   The degradation caused by developing oil and gas in places worthy of wilderness designation is irreversible. Once developed, the wilderness value of a place is lost. \\n   The Alaska Wilderness Act designates the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as wilderness--an area to remain wild and undeveloped in perpetuity--and thereby preserves one of the last great natural treasures on the North American continent for generations to come. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990421\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from Kentucky, with whom I am proud to join in this effort, and I thank him, really, for his initiative and leadership in this regard. He was the first, that I am aware of, to make this proposal. It made a lot of sense to me when we talked about it. \\n   I must say, from the time we introduced it--which must be 4 weeks ago, now, when the NATO air campaign began--to today, it seems to me the logic and the morality that was behind the original proposal has grown greater. In fact, the support has grown for this proposal from those whom I respect, who think deeply about this matter. Some at the high levels of our Government, while not supporting our proposal to arm the Kosovars, nonetheless have increasingly spoken of the Kosovar Liberation Army positively, as the Senator from Kentucky indicated, referring to its members as our allies, and even defended them against some of the criticisms that have been heard against them. \\n   Yesterday I came to the floor to join with several colleagues on both sides of the aisle to introduce a resolution which would authorize the President, as Commander in Chief, to take all actions necessary to achieve the objectives that NATO has stated for our action in the Balkans: To remove the Serbian military and paramilitary from Kosovo, to allow the Kosovars to return to their homes to live in peace, and to provide for an international peacekeeping force. It seems to me one of the steps that might be taken--and taken as soon as humanly possible--which supports the three NATO objectives, is exactly the proposal that Senator MCCONNELL and I are making, which is to offer some truly minimal support to help arm and hopefully, at some point, better train the Kosovars who are fighting to defend their own communities, their own families, their own freedom, their own lives. \\n   I think there are compelling strategic and moral reasons that argue for this legislation. The fact is, we are engaged in a battle, and it is a difficult battle. I am one who believes the NATO aerial bombardments, which will probably continue for weeks, are hurting the Serbs. Hopefully this bombardment will bring the leadership in Belgrade to their senses so they will order the Serbian troops out of Kosovo, which is one of our objectives. But let\\'s speak truthfully about this. There is no indication of any breaking of will in Belgrade at the current time. There simply is none. If, after weeks and perhaps months of bombardment and still Milosevic does not yield we will not have achieved our objectives. Then we will face a stark choice. What my friend from Kentucky and I are saying is, at that point we will ask ourselves, how can we alter the status quo on the ground, since the air campaign has not done it? And the only way to do that, of course, is with forces on the ground. Then we will face a very difficult choice, which I have said I believe we have to at least begin to think about and consider and plan for, if that is necessary. That is whether to introduce NATO ground forces, including American soldiers into conflict in the Balkans. \\n   But the fact is, as the Senator from Kentucky said, there are forces on the ground now fighting the Serbian invaders. They are the Kosovars themselves. They have by far the deepest and most genuine reason to fight, and they have the will to do so. They are fighting to defend themselves and their neighbors, their communities. They are fighting with remarkable resilience. The fact is, Milosevic had two aims in invading Kosovo. One was obviously to eliminate the Kosovars, to slaughter some of them, to torture and rape others, and expel the rest. A critical part of that strategy, the other aim was to defeat, totally defeat, the force on the ground, the indigenous force that is fighting Milosevic and frustrating his desires. That is the KLA, the Kosovar Liberation Army. Remarkably, He has failed totally at that. \\n   Of course many people who have worn the uniform and carried the flag of the KLA have lost their lives already, but the numbers in uniform  there have grown as people from all over the world, not just from within Kosovo--including hundreds, maybe thousands, from the United States, Albanian Americans--have gone over there to fight this just fight. So they are on the ground, ready to fight. But they do not have enough to fight with. They do not have a lot of ammunition. In some cases they do not even have a lot of food. \\n   But we have a common enemy here. Remember the old slogan, ``The enemy of my enemy is my friend.\\'\\' The enemy of our enemy, Milosevic, is now our ally in this fight. Senator MCCONNELL said it. Our military is talking to them every day. They are providing us with valuable information from the ground that has helped us to target enemy locations in Kosovo. So we have crossed that bridge. Why not do the next logical step to advance our military purposes and to support them with arms? \\n   I make a moral argument here, too, as well as a strategic argument. No matter what else was happening, these poor people have been victimized in a way we hate to imagine. But we have to imagine it because we see it on TV every day. We read about it in the newspaper. The fortunate ones do not look very fortunate at all. They are the ones who have been expelled. I say that comparatively, of course, because the ones who are less fortunate are the ones who have been slaughtered, who have lost their lives, who have been separated from their families and may well be trapped in areas of Kosovo now where they are starving. \\n   So these people are exercising not just their legal right but their moral right to defend themselves. That right is at the heart of our own history and our own moral system. What was our Revolution about? It was about a valiant attempt by a band of patriots, freedom fighters, to break loose of the Crown and the suppression it was imposing on colonial America--fortunately, much less brutal and barbaric than that imposed on the people of Kosovo by the Serbs, and by Milosevic particularly. \\n   So I think we cannot stand by and watch this slaughter. That is why we got involved in the first place. But I also think we cannot stand by and watch these brave people, against superior forces, equipped with much more than they have, fight, and not want to come to their defense. \\n   I know there are critics of these people, as Senator MCCONNELL has said. Some say the KLA is composed of extremists, Marxists; they may have connection with groups in the world which we oppose. Some even say some of them are drug runners. I cannot vouch for every one of the thousands of members of the Kosovar Liberation Army. I cannot speak to every place they are receiving funds, though I would say that a starving person does not ask the ideology or source of income of a person offering him or her food. \\n   In the same way, in ways that we may not like, people who are fighting for their freedom against very difficult odds may not always question the sources of help they need so desperately. \\n   Of course, the best way for us to overcome these questions is for ourselves and, hopefully, some of our NATO allies to become the sources of financial support for the Kosovar Liberation Army. I will share with you my impression, based on all that I have read and studied about the Kosovar Liberation Army--the UCK, as they are called in their native language--and all that I have heard about them from their friends and relatives in this country, fellow Americans. \\n   If I may, it reminds me of that old line about what is the definition of a conservative? A conservative is a liberal who has been mugged. That is from an earlier time. What is the definition of a member of the KLA? It is probably a citizen of Kosovo who has watched his house burn, his brother murdered and his daughter raped. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-2-19990421\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-3-19990421\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Yes, indeed. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-4-19990421\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. The Senator is correct. It is more than a reasonable assumption. I am a member of the Armed Services Committee. We recently had a hearing on Kosovo with Secretary Cohen and General Shelton. I was quite struck by two things: First, to hear General Shelton say that one of our aims of our air campaign is to degrade the Serbian military in Kosovo so that the UCK--the KLA--can achieve a balance of power with the Serbian forces there. So we have the Chairman of our Joint Chiefs of Staff linking us with them. Of course, the better way, the easier way to achieve that balance of power is by arming the Kosovars. \\n   The second is, one of the members of the committee echoed some of the criticisms of the KLA--terrorists, extremists, drug merchants. And Secretary Cohen, our Defense Secretary, serving with remarkable skill in this crisis, came to the defense of the KLA and said, yes, he couldn\\'t say that everyone there was an angel, but that the balance of equities of morality was clearly on the side of the KLA. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-5-19990421\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. May I ask, Mr. President, for an additional 5 minutes for the Senator from Kentucky and myself? \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-6-19990421\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. The Senator from Kentucky is quite right. That is my recollection, that there was a very \\n   good report given, with some surprise, but admiration, I say, by the intelligence communities that the numbers fighting with the KLA have, in fact, grown. There is such a painful irony here. As we both said, while the air campaign goes on, the suffering, the expulsion, the murder nonetheless goes on in Kosovo on the ground, and the only force there that can stop it now is the KLA, and we are hesitating to support them. \\n   I take them to be much more in the spirit of partisans who fought during the Second World War against overwhelming odds, perhaps even the freedom fighters in Hungary during 1956 and later in Prague, during the Prague spring. We have not only a strategic tie with them, it is much more consistent with our own history and values and our belief in democracy that we try to support this group, which, as the Senator says, is not being vanquished. \\n   The truth is, if I were Milosevic, the one thing I would fear is the United States and the West arming the KLA because he knows their zeal, their purpose, the will they have to fight. They are brave. They will take losses because they are fighting for a greater purpose, and, in fact, if I were Milosevic, the one thing I would fear, and what I believe he will face in any case, is a long-term indigenous insurgency, which I predict he will never be able to stop. The sooner we help them, the sooner we bring them to the result that they and we want. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-7-19990421\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. The Senator from Kentucky is absolutely right. That is the purpose. The purpose is to push this option, this act which will support our objectives, objectives for which we are spending billions of dollars and already risking American lives, to push us closer to achieving those objectives and also, if I may add, to hopefully force some discussion of this option among our NATO allies. \\n   One of the arguments we hear about why this is not being considered by the administration is that there is opposition to it among our NATO allies. But we also hear there is opposition among our NATO allies, which I understand at this point, to the introduction of NATO ground forces. If there is opposition in NATO, as there is in Congress and in the administration, as the Senator has said, to the introduction of ground forces, including Americans, then, again, isn\\'t it both wise militarily and powerful morally for us to as soon as possible be helping the fighters on the ground, the KLA? \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-8-19990421\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. The Senator from Kentucky is right, and there is a painful irony here. He is absolutely right both about our objectives on the ground and our objectives to maintain stability in the region which is being destabilized now by these large refugee flows. \\n   The victories, if one can call them that, that the tragic, brutal, barbaric victories that Milosevic\\'s forces have had over the Kosovars are hollow. They are barbaric because this was an armed force fighting against unarmed, undefended people. It is a question that will hang in the air--and some later time we will come back to it--what might have been different if, in fact, the KLA had been better armed at the outset of this a month or two or three ago, because I think that might have deterred, certainly delayed the massive exodus and slaughter that has been carried out against this undefended indigenous population. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-9-19990421\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend from Kentucky for his leadership. We intend to pursue this and urge our colleagues to consider it as quickly as possible so that we may do something concrete and tangible that really can alter the balance of power and the balance of morality and the balance militarily on the ground in Kosovo. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990420\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the bill we are introducing today: the Auto Choice Reform Act of 1999. If enacted, this bill would save American consumers tens of billions of dollars, while at the same time producing an auto insurance system that operates more efficiently and promises drivers better and quicker compensation. \\n   America\\'s drivers are plagued today by an auto accident insurance and compensation system that is too expensive and that does not work. We currently pay an average of approximately $775 annually for our auto insurance per car. This is an extraordinarily large sum, and one that is particularly difficult for people of modest means--and almost impossible for poor people--to afford. A study of Maricopa County, AZ, drives this point home. That study found that families living below 50 percent of the poverty line spend nearly one-third of their household income on premiums when they purchase auto insurance. \\n   Perhaps those costs would be worth it if they meant that people injured in  car accidents were fully compensated for their injuries. But under the current tort system, that often is not the case, particularly for people who are seriously injured. Because of the need to prove fault and the ability to receive compensation only through someone else\\'s insurance policy, some injured drivers--like those in one car accidents or those who are found to have been at fault themselves--are left without any compensation at all. Others must endure years of litigation before receiving compensation for their injuries. In the end, many people who suffer minimal injuries in auto accidents end up overcompensated, while victims of serious injuries often fail to receive full restitution. Indeed, the extent to which seriously injured drivers are undercompensated in the current tort system is staggering: victims with economic losses--things like lost wages and medical bills--between $25,000 and $100,000 recover only 56 percent of their losses on average, while those with over $100,000 in economic losses get only about 9 percent back on average. Recite those numbers to anyone who tells you the current system works just fine the way it is. \\n   The current system most hurts the very people who can afford it the least--the nation\\'s poor and drivers who live in the nation\\'s inner cities. The $775 average premium I mentioned is already far too much for people of modest means to afford. But for many residents of the inner cities a $775 premium is just a dream. As a report issued by Congress\\' Joint Economic Committee last year starkly detailed, inner city residents pay what can only \\n   be called a ``tort tax\\'\\'--insurance rates that are often double those of their suburban neighbors. For example, a married man with no accidents or traffic violations living in Philadelphia pays $1,800 for an insurance policy that would cost him less than half that if he moved just over the line, out of Philadelphia County. The average annual premium for a 38-year old woman with a clean driving record living in central Los Angeles approaches $3,500. The statistic that I think best drives home the disproportionate amount poor people spend on auto insurance is this one: the typical low-income household spends more on auto insurance over two years than the entire value of their car. \\n   The results of these high costs shouldn\\'t surprise us. They lead many inner-city drivers to choose to drive uninsured, which is to say our auto insurance system makes outlaws of them and puts the rest of us in jeopardy, because people injured by an uninsured driver may have no place to go for compensation. Other inner-city residents simply decide not to own cars, something that in itself should trouble us. As the JEC\\'s Report details, the lack of car ownership, combined with the dearth of jobs in the inner-cities, severely limits the ability of many city residents to find employment and lift themselves out of poverty. \\n   The Auto Choice bill would go a long way towards solving all of these problems. By simply giving consumers a choice to opt out of the tort system, Auto Choice would bring all drivers who want it lower premiums. Auto Choice would save drivers nationally an average of 23 percent, or $184, annually--a total of over $35 billion. Connecticut drivers would see an average savings of $217 annually. Low-income drivers would see even more dramatic savings--an average of 36 percent nationally or 33 percent in Connecticut. \\n   Here\\'s how our plan would work: All drivers would be required to purchase a certain minimum level of insurance, but they would get to choose the type of coverage they want. Those drivers who value immediate compensation for their injuries and lower premiums would be able to purchase what we call ``personal injury protection insurance.\\'\\' If the driver with that type of coverage is injured in an accident, he or she would get immediate compensation for economic losses up to the limits of his or her policy, without regard to who was at fault in the accident. \\n   If their economic losses exceeded those policy limits, the injured party could sue the other driver for the extra economic loss on a fault basis; The only thing the plaintiff could not do is sue the other driver for noneconomic losses, the so-called pain and suffering damages. \\n   Those drivers who did not want to give up the ability to collect pain and suffering damages could choose a different option, called tort maintenance coverage. Drivers with that type of policy would be able to cover themselves for whatever level of economic and noneconomic damages they want, and they would then be able to collect those damages, also from their own insurance company, after proving fault. \\n   As I mentioned earlier, the savings from this new Choice system would be dramatic--again, an average of $184 annually nationally, up to $35 billion each and every year under our proposal. \\n   Our Auto Choice plan ensures that most injured people would be compensated immediately and that we all can purchase auto insurance at a reasonable rate. Mr. President, this bill would be a boon to the American driver and to the American economy. I look forward to working with my colleagues to see it enacted into law. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-2-19990420\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank my friend from Nebraska for yielding time to me. \\n   Mr. President, I come to the floor and to the decision to cosponsor this resolution with a deep sense of seriousness and purpose. These are fateful, historic and very consequential matters that we are discussing and engaged in today. \\n   Great nations such as this one, and great alliances such as NATO, do not remain great if they do not uphold their principles and keep their promises. That has always been true, of course, but it seems powerfully so today, as we prepare to welcome NATO and much of the rest of the world to Washington this week to commemorate the 50th anniversary of this great alliance. \\n   We are being tested. This alliance and this Nation are being tested in ways that a few months ago we never could have imagined would have been the case as we prepared for this commemoration. So it becomes now, in its way, less an unlimited celebration and more a renewal of commitment to the principles which animated and necessitated the organization of NATO 50 years ago. We are called on today to uphold those principles, the principles of a free and secure transatlantic community. We must keep the promises we have made in support of those principles. NATO must prevail in the Balkans, in Kosovo. \\n   Thugs, renegade regimes and power-hungry maniacs everywhere in the world are watching our actions in the Balkans and gauging our resolve. They must receive an unequivocal message. They must understand that they violate our principles, they ignore our promises and threats at their peril. \\n   That is the context in which I am proud to cosponsor this resolution, to stand by our national and alliance principles, to keep our promises and to send an unequivocal message to Milosevic and all the other thugs of the world: You cannot defy forces united for common decency and humanity; you cannot ignore our promises and threats. We will not end the 20th century standing idle, allowing a murderous tyrant to mar all that we together have accomplished in Europe and in this transatlantic community over the last five decades. \\n   Mr. President, I was privileged to go, almost 2 weeks ago now, to Europe with Secretary Cohen on a bipartisan, bicameral delegation of Congress. I brought home with me a heightened respect for the military machine that we and NATO--particularly in the United States--have developed. It is awesome in its capability and power, and our service men and women are, without a doubt, the best trained and the most committed that any nation has ever produced. I say that to say, as a matter of confidence, that no matter what it takes, they will prevail over Milosevic. \\n   I still believe that the current air campaign, which is being very effectively implemented, can succeed in achieving our goals in this conflict. That, of course, depends on the test of wills that is going on now and on the test of sanity that is going on now. If there is any sanity in an enlightened national self-interest left in the higher counsels of government in Belgrade, they will stop the NATO air bombardment of their country by accepting NATO\\'s terms and restoring peace. \\n   However, it would be irresponsible not to plan for other military options that may be necessary to defeat this enemy. Not only should all options remain on the table, but all options must be adequately analyzed and readied. \\n   In the case of ground forces, which will take weeks to deploy should they be necessary, we should begin now to plan for the logistics of such a mission and to ensure that appropriate personnel are adequately trained. \\n   I say again what I have said before, I hope and pray that NATO ground forces are not needed. I hope common sense, sanity will prevail in the government in Belgrade, but it would be irresponsible not to prepare NATO\\'s forces now for their potential deployment, and it would be similarly irresponsible, I believe, for Congress, in these circumstances, not to authorize the President, as Commander in Chief, under article I, section 2 of our Constitution, to take whatever actions are necessary to achieve the noble objectives we have set out for ourselves in the Balkans by defeating Milosevic. That is what this resolution does, and that is why I am proud to be a cosponsor. \\n   In the last week or so, several countries and others have offered proposals for seeking a negotiated cease-fire.  While we all pray for peace in the Balkans, I think it is important that the peace be a principled peace. NATO has clearly stated objectives, and we can settle for nothing less than the attainment of those reasonable objectives. \\n   They are quite simply that the Serbian invaders, the military and paramilitary forces that have wreaked havoc, bloodshed, and terror on the Kosovar Albanians be withdrawn from Kosovo; that the Kosovars be allowed to return, to be able to do no more than we take for granted every day of our lives in the U.S., which is to live in peace and freedom in their homes and villages; and that there be an international peacekeeping force to monitor that peace that we will have achieved. \\n   If we agree on the worth and the justice of those objectives, we--NATO, the United States--must be prepared to do whatever is \\n   necessary to achieve those objectives. To negotiate half a victory, which is no victory, to claim that we have achieved military objectives without achieving the principled objectives that motivated our involvement, would effectively be a devastating defeat, not just for the human rights of the people of Kosovo, but for NATO and the United States. \\n   By introducing this resolution today, we begin a very serious and fateful debate. Today is just the beginning of it. It must, because of the seriousness of all that is involved here, engage not just the executive branch of our Government and the Members of Congress of both parties and both Houses, but the American people as well. \\n   I come back to the bottom line in concluding. I am convinced that we are engaged in a noble mission with our allies in the Balkans, which goes to the heart of international security, European security and American security, but also goes to the heart of our principles as a nation. \\n   I close, if I may, with a prayer that God will be with all those who are fighting in the Balkans today for freedom and human rights and soften the hearts of our opposition so that the additional force that the Commander in Chief would be authorized to deploy, if this resolution passes, will not be necessary. But if it is, let this resolution stand, introduced as it is today by a bipartisan group of Members of the Senate, let this resolution stand for the clear statement that we will stand together as long as necessary to achieve the principles we cherish in the Balkans, as well as the security that we require. \\n   I thank the Chair, and I yield to my friend and colleague from Nebraska. \\n   Mr. HAGEL addressed the Chair. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990415\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Hear, hear, Mr. President. I thank my friend and colleague from Connecticut. I am proud to join with him in introducing this resolution commemorating what was truly one of the most thrilling and uplifting moments in the modern history of our State--and I do not say that lightly--the national championship won by the University of Connecticut men\\'s basketball team. \\n   I think to understand what this achievement means to our relatively small State, my colleagues have to understand what this UCONN team has meant for the last decade to the people of Connecticut. I don\\'t think there are many teams in the country that have a more rabid following than our Huskies. From their home base in Storrs, clear across the State to Stamford, from Stonington in the east to Salisbury in the northwest, every basketball season, the people of Connecticut are gripped with a delirium known affectionately as ``Huskymania,\\'\\' which makes every day of the season seem like March Madness in Connecticut. The interest is so intense that the Huskies, hailing from the third smallest State in America, travel with the largest contingent of reporters in all of college basketball, referred to simply as ``the horde.\\'\\' \\n   Now, Mr. President, over the last decade, Huskymania has been heightened by the enormous success of our great coach, Jim Calhoun and athletic director, Lew Perkins. UCONN has dominated the storied Big East Conference, winning six regular season championships, distinguishing itself in NCAA tournament play, advancing to the Elite Eight three different times. The one thing missing was a trip to the fabled Final Four and a national championship, and that dream was realized on March 29 with the victory over the Duke Blue Devils in what has to have been, not just for Connecticut fans, but for basketball fans all over the country, one of the great games in recent history of college basketball. \\n   The Huskies\\' thrilling victory touched off a joyous celebration in our State, which is normally known as ``the land of steady habits,\\'\\' an exhilaration which I experienced literally firsthand that night. I could not go to Florida to see the game, but I did the next best thing--I went to Coach\\'s Bar and Grill in Hartford, CT, which is partially owned by Coach Calhoun. Let me just say to my colleagues on the floor, I was, by far, the senior citizen in the bar that night. It seemed like about half of the State\\'s under-30 population was there. The fervor was intense and the joy extreme when the game was over. \\n   Let me say that we are proud of this victory, but we are also really proud of the values that are part of it--the teamwork, the sacrifice, the sportsmanship, the determination and the dignity this team and its coach showed in scrapping and hustling their way to the pinnacle of college basketball. The character of this UCONN team is an apt reflection of their great coach, Jim Calhoun, who is a great coach because he is a great man, a man of indomitable spirit, tremendous values, and a great pursuit of excellence. I am thrilled that Coach Calhoun is finally getting his due as one of the Nation\\'s great coaches. \\n   For now, I am grateful for the wonderful gift that Jim and his players have given the people of Connecticut, for the way they brought such a diverse State together and reaffirmed our sense of community, for living up to our highest ideals of sport and--if you will allow me a pun in the name of the Huskies--for showing \\n   that every dog does indeed have their day. \\n   Now, Mr. President, if I may close somewhat unusually, at Coach\\'s Bar and Grill on the night of the game, one of the young men there, at a critical moment in the first half, turned to me and asked me if I would lead the UCONN cheer, and I did that. I was  criticized the first time because they said my N\\'s were not too good. You will see what I mean in a moment. As the game went on, I was called on repeatedly to lead this cheer, and of course, we in Coach\\'s Bar and Grill feel that made the margin of difference in the victory that occurred in Florida that night. \\n   If you will allow me, Mr. President, here is the cheer: U-C-O-N-N, UCONN, UCONN, UCONN. \\n   Thank you. I urge adoption of the resolution. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990325\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to express my dissapointment with S. Con. Res. 20, the FY 2000 Budget Resolution. After our economy has enjoyed seven years of strong growth, I had hoped that this year\\'s Budget Resolution, the first in the new millenium, would set policy priorities that would strengthen our economy. After seven years of phenomenal economic growth, it is a shame that we cannot convert our gains into ensuring a more secure economic future. \\n   This Budget Resolution fails to take positive steps by trying to do too much. The Resolution calls for using surplus funds for tax cuts, while maintaining the statutory spending caps. \\n   The Budget Resolution fails to protect Medicare or Social Security, fails to increase national savings, and cuts important spending priorities. It is neither financially prudent nor economically sound. \\n   It could endanger our sound economy and squander an historic opportunity to raise the living standards of all Americans and to ensure a dignified retirement for our seniors. \\n   S. Con. Res. 20 favors massive tax cuts over paying down the massive national debt, over protecting Medicare and Social Security, and over key important domestic initiatives. By keeping the statutory caps and using the surplus for tax cuts, the Budget Resolution makes deep cuts in science technology, in research and development, in important environmental protection initiatives, while failing to protect Medicare and the retirement security of our workers and families. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-2-19990325\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to support the Sense of the Senate regarding Federal Research and Development, Section 310 of the Concurrent Budget Resolution. \\n   The past few years of economic growth have led us to a remarkable stage in this country\\'s history. For the first time, we have both low inflation and low unemployment, a stock market which seems boundless and, more germane to the discussion at hand, a historic budget surplus. However, the budget we have prepared for the turn of the new millenium is not one which promotes growth. Specifically, the small and declining accounts in research and development (R&D) are a direct prescription for long term economic decline. Let me explain. \\n   There have been at least a dozen major economic studies in recent years, including those of Nobel Prize winner Robert Solow, which conclude that technological progress is the primary ingredient in economic growth, accounting for 50% or more of total growth. These studies further show that technological progress has twice the impact on economic growth of labor or capital. Ironically, we have spent far more time in Congress debating the economic impact of labor and capital, in the form of jobs and tax bills, than we have ever devoted to R&D, which is the true workhorse of economic growth. Today, the relationship between technological progress and economic growth is apparent even to the lay person. The Internet, cancer drugs, cellular phones, and computer-related services are ubiquitous. Communications and technology stocks now account for 80% of the value of today\\'s booming $1.4 trillion stock market. Furthermore, the productivity improvements generated by leap-ahead advances in communications and computers have translated into an economic strength that makes us the envy of the world. \\n   Because it takes 20-30 years for fundamental discoveries to evolve into market products, we happen to be benefitting handsomely from the government\\'s large investment in R&D in the mid-1960\\'s. However, we have historically been poor guardians of that investment. This year is no exception. The Budget Committee\\'s proposed cuts in research in R&D, totaling as much as 40% in some areas, sit atop a long historical decline which has already more than halved our total R&D investment (as a percent of GDP) over the past 34 years. In 1965, we spent an amount equivalent to 2.2% of our GDP on R&D; in 1998, that amount was 0.8%. Commenting on our nation\\'s 34 year decline in R&D investments, the investment guru Peter Lynch has said, ``If I saw a business with an R&D trend like this, I wouldn\\'t buy the stock.\\'\\' \\n   Almost every other country understands the rationale for R&D, and is especially conscious of the government\\'s unique role in supporting basic research. As a result, thirteen countries now spend more on basic R&D as a percent of GDP than do we. What is the result of that investment? One result is that these countries maintain their base of excellence in science. If one looks at the set of nations with ``significantly higher\\'\\' high school science achievement scores than the US, eight of the top eleven nations which comprise that list are the same eight nations which are in the top ten of basic science funding as a fraction of GDP. \\n   Exactly why there is such a strong correlation between research investment and high school science scores is not clear, but the correlation there, it is strong, and it bears investigation. \\n   Last year, the Senate began to recognize the value of R&D to the economy and to our innovation base. We passed, without opposition, S. 2217, which sought to double R&D spending over the next decade. The bill was bipartisan, had 36 cosponsors, and passed without dissent. A Sense of the Senate amendment was also unanimously passed during this year\\'s budget committee mark-up, calling for greater R&D investment. In contrast to these mandates for more R&D spending, the budget we see here today cuts R&D substantially. \\n   Although much of the discussion regarding R&D investment has focused on civilian R&D, I would like to point out the special and troubling case of military R&D. Historically, DoD has funded the lion\\'s share of research in mathematics, engineering, and the physical sciences, both in our military laboratories and in our university system. The output of this innovation enterprise is unmatched. If one looks at the U.S. cadre of Nobel Prize winners, 58% of the physics laureates and 43% of the chemistry laureates were funded by DoD prior to winning their Nobel prizes. What I find disturbing is the fact that we are dismantling this engine of innovation through dramatic cuts in DoD R&D, even as we are in the process of transforming from the Cold War Era to the much more technologically demanding era of--if I may use the term--``techno-warfare.\\'\\' Every scenario of future military dominance by the U.S. assumes that we will inevitably have superior technology. However, if we are dramatically cutting military R&D, and we are simultaneously not supporting civilian R&D, exactly where is that technological superiority going to come from? Each of our services currently spends 60-80% of its funds on readiness issues (i.e., operations and maintenance) and 20-40% of their funds on modernization tasks for incremental improvements (i.e., procurement, testing and evaluation). The obligation authority for science and technology--the military of the future--is currently less than 2% of the military budget. Even this minute fraction is destined to decline further under the budget we see before us today. Though we face daunting readiness problems in the present, we are far less ready for the future. \\n   The president\\'s budget for military R&D proposed significant cuts, on the order of 6%, that the budget committee\\'s budget will probably worsen. The budget committee\\'s 19 billion increase for DoD is unlikely to accommodate all of DoD\\'s readiness, modernization, retention, recruitment, and ballistic missile defense needs. The Armed Services\\'  Committee\\'s probable response will be to squeeze the already small R&D budget enormously. DoD itself has requested extensive cuts in S&T (science and technology) which contrast sharply with its request for $112 billion in increases for readiness and modernization over the next 5-6 years. The DoD budget requests, in conjunction with the budget committee\\'s actions, make it clear that the problems the military is experiencing at present--though undoubtedly pressing--are actively preventing adequate long-term strategic planning. \\n   A recent Council on Competitiveness report shows that, as a nation, we are currently unmatched in our potential to innovate, due to our past investments in R&D through our military, industry, and university systems, and due to our vibrant venture capital sector. Let us not make the mistake of starving the system that gives us our greatest strength, just as we embark on the ``Innovation Economy\\'\\' of the new millenium. \\n   The budget resolution before us dramatically fails in its commitment to nourish R&D, which is the key to our future economy, our future security, and our future well being. The major cuts it makes in both civilian and military R&D--in our innovation system--are not supportable. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-3-19990325\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a Sense of the Senate resolution as an amendment to the Budget Resolution. I am pleased to be joined in this endeavor by Senators SANTORUM, BINGAMAN, and ABRAHAM. As my colleagues know, saving is empowering. It allow families to weather the bad times, to live without aid, and to deal with emergencies. But more than just being a safety net, savings offer families a ladder up. That is because saving is the first step towards developing assets. And assets beget assets. Having them can actually change a family\\'s economic station and set a better course for generations to come. \\n   Yet, despite our booming economy we know that fully a third of all American households have no financial assets to speak of. For those with children the outlook is even worse. Almost half of all American children live in households that have no financial assets. This, in my view, is an untenable situation that should be changed. \\n   Mr. President, we in the Senate have produced some innovative legislation in recent years that are designed to encourage Americans to build assets for retirement. That is due in no small part to the leadership of Senator ROTH and Senator MOYNIHAN; Senate leaders who understand the importance of savings. However, I believe that we have been remiss in neglecting the American that assets can benefit the most: the working poor. They need to build assets not just for retirement, but also for the betterment of their lives and those of their children. \\n   So Mr. President I, along with my distinguished colleagues offer this Sense of the Senate. It simply says that the tax laws should encourage low-income workers and their families to build assets. Similar language was offered by Representative THOMPSON, and passed unanimously in the House Budget Committee mark-up. I hope that this resolution will also be accepted here unanimously. Thank you and I cede the remainder of my time. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-4-19990325\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, this new era of budget surpluses presents us with a tremendous opportunity to expand our investment in education, particularly our efforts to improve our public schools and raise academic achievement. This opportunity could not come at a better time, given the growing importance of knowledge in this Information Age economy, the  growing concerns parents have about the ability of our schools to adequately prepare America\\'s children for the challenges ahead of them, and the growing interest here in Congress in retooling our Federal education policy this year through the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. \\n   The budget resolution before us makes an attempt to seize that opportunity providing for a $32 billion increase in elementary and secondary education programs over the next five years. But I am disappointed that the architects of this plan did not go further, that rather than making a dramatic statement about the priority we place on education quality, this resolution instead opts to devote far more resources to broad-based tax cuts. In particular, I am disappointed that, because of this preference for tax cuts, we have failed to fund the President\\'s plan to help local school districts reduce elementary school class sizes by hiring 100,000 new teachers, a plan I am proud to have cosponsored. And I am disappointed that we have failed to fully fund our share of IDEA, to finally meet the pledge Congress made to cover 40 percent of the cost of providing a free and appropriate education to children with special needs. Eliminating this shortfall is by far the top priority of the teachers and principals and administrators in my state of Connecticut, whose budgets are being busted by the spiraling costs of meeting the requirements of IDEA, and who tell us that all children are suffering as a result. \\n   It is my hope that we could rectify this imbalance, which is why I am joining many of my colleagues in cosponsoring an amendment that would significantly strengthen our investment in education. Specifically, it would shift one-fifth of the funding reserved for tax cuts, $156 billion over the next 10 years, into education accounts. This shift would enable us to fully fund the class-size initiative and meet our IDEA obligations, as well as provide additional resources to several important K-12 programs. This amendment is broadly supported by a wide array of education groups, and I believe that it truly reflects the will of the American, people who have repeatedly expressed their preference for using the surplus to lift up our schools over broad-based tax cuts. \\n   I would strongly urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this amendment and send a clear signal to the American people about the priorities of this Congress, about our willingness to seize the unique opportunity this new budget environment affords to invest in our children\\'s future. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-5-19990325\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, while I support the underlying Chafee amendment providing $200 million in increased funding for the state-side portion of the Land and Water Conservation Program, I object to the use of funds from Function 370 as an offset. The Land and Water Fund monies are of critical importance to communities in my state and around the nation, and I have pledged to work hard to ensure that the state-side portion of the Fund is revived. I believe that revival of the State-side Fund represents the commitment of all Americans to conserving natural treasures and preserving open space. \\n   Nevertheless, Function 370 is not the place to target offsets. Important programs under this budget function in the Commerce Department are vital to small businesses around the country and to our economic growth and our global competitiveness. Function 370 contains cost-effective initiatives that directly contribute to our economic well-being. Clearly, it makes little sense to take funds from some of the numerous cost effective programs in this Function when other areas in other Functions could better serve as offsets. I will support the amendment because I trust that the conference and the appropriations process will locate preferable offsets to fund this important Land and Water Conservation initiative. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990323\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend from Delaware. Mr. President, on Christmas Eve, 1992, President George Bush issued what is known as his ``Christmas warning\\'\\' to President Milosevic that if he attacked Kosovo, NATO would have to respond. We had President Clinton reinforce that threat as recently as last October. Milosevic signed a cease-fire agreement in which we again said to him, if you attack Kosovo, we will have to respond with force. What has happened? He is attacking Kosovo. The International Finnish Pathological Team said a massacre occurred there in January. Kosovar women and children were put on their knees and shot in the back of their heads. \\n   Mr. President, if NATO does not act, and if the United States does not act to be consistent not just with the threats we have made to him, the warnings he has ignored, but the principles that underlie those warnings, it will be more than the Kosovars who will suffer irreparable damage at the hands of the Serbians; NATO will be irreparably damaged and so, too, will the credibility of the United States. \\n   Mr. President, some of my colleagues say, ``What\\'s the plan?\\'\\' There is a plan here and we have heard it. There is a response and we have options as we go along. But I ask, what will happen if we don\\'t act? If we don\\'t act, a massacre will occur. There is great danger of a wider war in Kosovo, wider even than the one that would have occurred if we left the conflict in Bosnia unattended. With all due respect to my friend and dear colleague from Alaska who suggested we may be beginning world war III-- \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-2-19990323\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask the Senator for 30 \\n   seconds more. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-3-19990323\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. I will finish by saying I think what we are doing in authorizing this action is making sure that world war III does not begin in the Balkans. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990323\\n\\n    Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators HATCH and BAUCUS today in cosponsoring a bill to make the Research and Experimentation Tax Credit permanent. Technological innovation is the major factor driving economic and income growth in America today. A one percent increase in our nation\\'s investment in research results in a productivity increase of 0.23 percent. Productivity increases are what allow us to increase wages and standards of living. The R&D undertaken by our companies today is too important to our economy and our wages to allow its encouragement through tax credits to be an unstable, haphazard effort varying from one year to the next. \\n   Moreover, R&D has a significantly higher rate of return at the societal level than at the company level. There is a huge spillover effect from one person\\'s or one company\\'s innovation to other firms, other industries, and benefits to consumers. That is why government has a role in supporting R&D both directly through government funded research and through tax credits to private industry. All of society benefits from increased R&D. I strongly support making the R&D tax credit permanent so that our companies can engage confidently in long-term planning for sustained research investment. \\n   I believe making the R&D tax credit permanent is a priority. I also feel we must strengthen the United States investment in R&D through other means as well. Senators FRIST, ROCKEFELLER, DOMENICI, GRAMM and I are sponsoring a bill, S. 296--with 29 cosponsors--to double federal investment in research over the next decade. Government labs and University labs undertake much of the basic research in this country. We need to nurture these incubators of basic research not only by increasing government support for them, but to encourage private sector support and financing of them. That is why Senators DOMENICI, BINGAMAN, FRIST and I support some reforms to the R&D tax credit that will encourage the private sector to partner with Government and University labs. We will shortly be introducing a bill to increase the benefits of the R&D credit to all companies, encourage research consortia, and give special attention to research investment by small businesses. \\n   The reason we have been unable to make the R&D tax credit permanent is because it requires that the expenditures be scored for five years, thereby raising the budget costs. Extending the credit each year, sometimes at the last minute and sometimes retroactively, does not lower the cost to government, but increases the costs to industry by increasing its risk and uncertainty. Let\\'s stop this charade and do what\\'s right. Let\\'s make it permanent.  \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990318\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, with respect to my colleague from New Jersey and the other cosponsors of this amendment, I rise to oppose the amendment. I understand some of what has moved them to have the strong feelings they do that lead to this amendment, but I think it is certainly ill timed and ultimately ill advised. \\n   I say it is ill timed because the Committee on Governmental Affairs, on which I am honored to serve as the ranking Democratic member, is in the middle of an inquiry, holding hearings on the fundamental question of whether to reauthorize the independent counsel statute, hearings which will continue for at least a month more. I think it is worth letting that process work what we hope will be its thoughtful and constructive way. \\n   I know many of my colleagues oppose reauthorizing the statute, and that is true of Members on both sides of the political aisle, just as I am heartened by the fact that Members on both sides of the political aisle support the retention of the independent counsel statute or some version of it. I hope we can work together to develop a law that establishes the principles of independence of investigation when the highest officials of our Government are suspected of criminal behavior. It may take some time and some convincing. Most people believe this will not happen by the June 30 expiration date of the current statute. The statute, therefore, may lapse for a time while we work on this. But that would not be a catastrophe, because under existing law the independent counsel who are in effect now would continue to do their work. \\n   Regardless of how the underlying question of whether we have an independent counsel--inside the Justice Department, outside the Justice Department--or not, is resolved, I believe it would be a serious mistake to single out, as this amendment does, what I  gather to be four of the independent counsels for termination while their investigations are ongoing. In that sense, this amendment is not just a preemptive attack on the statute while we are still considering as a committee and as a body whether to reauthorize it, it is what might be called a personal attack on the most controversial independent counsels. In that sense, it actually cuts against the purpose of the statute in the first place, which was to provide for independence of investigation and prosecution. The fear was, when the statute was drafted and adopted in 1978 after Watergate, that prosecution--investigation of high-ranking officials of our Government would be interfered with by people in the executive branch who would be affected by those investigations. \\n   There is a way in which this amendment puts Congress in a position of compromising the independence of these investigations. Under the amendment, all the independent counsel investigations besides the ones covered still operating after the law expires on June 30, would continue. It is not until they reach the 3-year deadline in the amendment, but until their work had been completed and their offices were terminated pursuant to the statutory provisions which are currently in effect. \\n   There are two other ongoing independent counsel investigations begun in 1998 which, as my friend and colleague from New Jersey, I believe, just indicated, would never be affected--in fact, would never be affected by this amendment. Similarly, there may be other independent counsel currently \\n   operating under court seal, which we would therefore not know about, who would not be affected. And the Attorney General may appoint additional independent counsel before the statute expires on June 30. All of these would not be affected. This amendment as I understand it and read it, affects only four independent counsel: Kenneth Starr, David Barrett, Donald Smaltz, and Larry Thompson. \\n   I am not rising to oppose this amendment because I want to defend the investigations that these four men have carried out. I do not want to. I don\\'t need to. Some of the criticisms of their work may be valid; some may not be. But that is not the point, as I see it. The point is, and the question is: Do we in Congress want to set the precedent of terminating an ongoing separate branch investigation and prosecution for whatever the reason that it has aroused our opposition? I think this would be a bad precedent which smacks of violation of the separation of powers doctrine and values. \\n   I know we maintain the power of the purse, and it is an important power, but it has to be exercised with great discretion and sensitivity, particularly when we are affecting one of the other branches of Government and particularly when we are affecting a branch of Government whose particular participants here are involved in controversial independent investigations. It was no accident that the framers of the Constitution went out of their way in a whole series of cases, including in the impeachment provisions in the Constitution which we have just come through, to make it very clear that Congress does not have the power to prosecute. That was one of the lessons the framers learned from their own history. So, as we remember in the impeachment provisions, and it was central to the decision that many of us made, that impeachment existed not to prosecute the President in that case. \\n   That was something that the Constitution tells us could be done after an individual left office by the appropriate branch of government. I worry very much about the effect of the precedent that will be set here, understanding some of the concerns that motivate the amendment, but thinking beyond the current situation. A precedent would be set for Congress to intervene and terminate independent criminal investigations and/or prosecutions. We do not have to do it. The law makes clear that there are others who can take these steps. The independent counsel statute itself contains a mechanism by which the Attorney General can remove any independent counsel, including these four, for cause. So far she has declined to use that authority. I think to some extent what is involved here is our respect for her right, as the Nation\\'s chief law enforcement officer, to make the decision as to whether to use the power we have given her in statute to decide whether or not to remove these four independent counsel. \\n   Why should we presume to replace our judgment for hers? The statute also contains a provision by which either the Attorney General, the independent counsel, or the special panel of three appellate judges can move to terminate an investigation, if its work has been substantially completed, whether or not the independent counsel himself thinks that is the case. This amendment makes an exception to those ongoing statutory provisions for four independent counsel. It is not the proper role of Congress, in my belief, to decide that certain prosecutors should be fired in the midst of their work. We should apply the same provisions of the law to those independent counsel whose investigations have displeased us, either because of the content or the length of the investigations, as we do for those that have not displeased us. \\n   Even if this amendment\\'s 3-year cutoff applied equally to all of the independent counsel, it may well constitute an unjustifiable interference in ongoing criminal investigations. \\n   The independent counsel statute, as it exists today and as I mentioned earlier, grandfathers existing investigations, if the statute is not renewed, for a number of very good reasons. Among them are that after a prosecutor has spent time on a lengthy and complex investigation, he has built up a store of information, institutional memory, ongoing leads and relationships. Much of that would be lost if these cases were turned over to the Department of Justice midstream. Again and again, I have heard critics of the independent counsel statute complain of the inefficiencies involved in requiring newly appointed independent counsel to find office space and assemble staff before they begin their work, but we need to weigh carefully whether there are greater inefficiencies and greater harms involved in tearing apart these offices before they have finished their work. The inefficiencies, I think, would be compounded if we in Congress ultimately pass a statute to replace the current law. \\n   The legislative process has barely begun on the question of whether or not to renew in its current form or some revised form the Independent Counsel statute. None of us, certainly not I, can say where this will lead. Perhaps a new independent counsel would have to be appointed and attempt to reconstruct the work that had been done. Before a new law is passed, it is not clear to me how the Attorney General would be expected to handle the investigations that would be returned to the Department at the end of the year. \\n   Yesterday, in testimony before the Governmental Affairs Committee, the Attorney General promised to continue appointing independent counsel where necessary, pursuant to regulations, if the current statute expires. \\n   The amendment before us may have the ironic effect of requiring the Attorney General to immediately appoint a new independent counsel to resume investigations and prosecutions that were already well underway towards completion, which I fear might mean not only a bad precedent and principle, but additional expenses as well. \\n   Finally, Mr. President, the Attorney General declared yesterday that she is opposed to reauthorizing the independent counsel statute, but I think it is fair to say that she nonetheless saw dangers, problems implicit in the pursuit and purpose of the amendment before us now. I thought she urged us to reject it. At least she said it didn\\'t make sense to her. I admire her forthrightness on both counts, though I disagree with her on one. Whether or not you support the independent counsel statute, I hope my colleagues will think twice before going on record and supporting the precedent of premature termination by Congress of prosecutors who are appointed to be independent guardians of justice, independent from the executive branch and independent from the legislative branch as well. \\n   I thank my colleagues. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-2-19990318\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. I will. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-3-19990318\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from New Jersey. I do understand it. My reaction to it is that we are still taking from these offices that have been working on these cases and establishing a precedent for various reasons. It is a precedent that can be misused, as time goes on, of terminating an ongoing independent counsel prosecution by the individual, firing the individual who is doing it, turning it over to the Justice Department, which, of course, has many, many capable and experienced lawyers, but who have not been working on this case. Therefore, I think that it would suffer not only from redundancy and inefficiency, but most of all, I worry, no matter what we think about these four or the independent counsel statute, it would set a bad precedent of legislative intervention into independent investigation and prosecution. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-4-19990318\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. I will. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-5-19990318\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend from New Jersey. I will speak for a moment more and then yield to the Senator from Iowa. \\n   I think the Attorney General yesterday was asked two different questions, quite different, and didn\\'t give inconsistent answers, but I think my interpretation was, she said that an amendment of this kind would be unwise. She did say that if it was agreed to, the Department, as the Senator from New Jersey has indicated, would be capable of picking up these cases. \\n   Secondly, I want to indicate that I am not reaching a constitutional judgment that this is a violation of separation of powers. I have tried to be careful in my comments to state that. I do think it evokes separation of powers concerns and values. Taking the example that the Senator from New Jersey gives of reauthorization of State Department or Energy Department Offices, to me this would be a little bit like abolishing an assistant secretaryship in one of those Departments because we didn\\'t like the work that the particular Assistant Secretary was doing \\n   and saying, turn it over to the Secretary of State or Secretary of Energy and let them do it the way they want to do it. While we have the power to do that and we have the power of the purse, it would set a precedent that could come back to haunt us. \\n   I thank my colleagues, I thank my friend from New Jersey, and I yield to the Senator from Iowa. \\n   Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990315\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. \\n   Mr. President, I rise today to support S. 257, the National Missile Defense Act  of 1999, and, in doing so, I rise to support development and deployment of a limited national missile defense. \\n   Colleagues have said that this debate has begun today, and I am sure each Member of the Senate believes, because we have no greater responsibility under the Constitution than to provide for the common defense of our Nation. That is one of the fundamental reasons people form governments, to provide for their common defense. It is a duty we must fulfill with intellectual honesty and with thoughtful attention to the world in which we reside. \\n   Let us look honestly at the world today. The cold war is over, thankfully. Democracy triumphed over communism. The bipolar strategic tension of the world--two armed camps living in a strange balance of terror where each threatened to destroy the other if the first acted--is over, thankfully over. And in that sense we enjoy today the benefits of that victory. Everybody around the globe--people here in the United States, those in Russia, and certainly those who lived under the tyranny of the Soviet Union, three peoples of which so proudly and joyously joined NATO just this past weekend. Though the existential threats we faced are not there, the threats to our very existence are not there, as the operating tempo of our military makes clear, we face a remarkable series of threats to our security around the world. And we face something like threats we have faced before, but with an intensity and a breadth that are unparalleled; and that is the potential of threats to our homeland, to the United States of America, shielded as we have been by geography, by two oceans. Although we have worried in the past and we have been at war and conflict about threats to our homeland, we have never faced them, I fear, to the same extent we will in the years ahead. And this is a reflection not only of the dispersion of power, the breakup of the two armed camps that dominated and defined the cold war, it is a reflection of what history tells us, which is that whenever there are developments in the nonmilitary world, in the industrial, or, in our time, the technological world, they work their way into the military. \\n   Today, even as nationalism rears its head with a new intensity in places like the Balkans, national boundaries in the conventional sense are seamless and less dominant. We communicate with each other through television and now, dramatically, in two-way communication over the Internet, jumping over traditional national boundaries. We have a growing number of assets, defense and civilian related, which exist in space that affect our lives, civilian and military, in very, very fundamental ways. We have increasing capacity through technology to deliver weapons of mass destruction against other peoples and to fear and face the potential of their delivery against us. \\n   So it is not surprising that, within the community of those who worry about our national security, and particularly, of course, within the Department of Defense, there is new concern, new thinking, talk of new organization, to deal with homeland \\n   defense, the defense of the United States of America; that the very technology that has enabled us to reach across national boundaries, to have international commerce at enormous volume and worth with remarkable speed, also begins to subject us in our homes, businesses, neighborhoods, communities, and States to attack. \\n   I don\\'t mean to suggest a panic, but, to be intellectually honest and thoughtful about it, the fact is that we have in our time already seen ourselves subject to terrorist attack here in our homeland, some of which has been inspired from outside, that we know we face a risk of attack to our information systems, which dominate and on which we depend for so much in the lives that we lead so well today. \\n   Another element of that new vulnerability that our homeland faces is from missile attack. We faced it during the cold war when the Soviet Union and the United States were two armed camps with intercontinental ballistic missiles aimed at each other, in which we reached a kind of bizarre agreement, ``rationality\\'\\' in the midst of irrationality, that neither would push the button for fear of what damage that would do to the one who pushed the button. Today, we are facing a threat of a different order. Though it is limited, it is coming from people who will not, we fear, bind to the same rationale of a system of mutual assured destruction. \\n   That is what motivates this bill. I see it as a response not just to the proliferation of ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction, but as part of a broader, growing concern that we in the Senate and the American people will have to face to raise our defenses once again here at home. \\n   In the very near future--perhaps within a few months--erratic leaders, tyrants of rogue regimes, will control ballistic missiles possibly armed with weapons of mass destruction that can reach our national territory. \\n   One or more rogue states may have the technology to do so today. Equally unsettling is the fact that criminal or insurgent elements from countries in turmoil could also have access to those weapons. \\n   So the threat is real and it is current, and everything we know about the rapid dissemination of technological information and the commercial proliferation of ballistic missile technology and weapons of mass destruction tells us that the threat will get worse faster than we had previously thought. \\n   Until this past year, most observers, intelligent observers, thoughtful observers, believed that the emergence of such a threat was way over the horizon, a problem for the future. A national intelligence estimate written in 1993 and revised in 1995 concluded that no country other than the declared nuclear powers would develop or otherwise acquire ballistic missiles that could reach the 48 contiguous United States within the next 10 to 15 years. But in July of 1998, a commission of distinguished experts, chaired by former Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld, concluded that this earlier estimate was far too optimistic. \\n   The Rumsfeld Commission report found that North Korea, Iran, and Iraq were engaged in concerted efforts to build or acquire ballistic missiles. The panel also found that North Korea and Iran could use these missiles to inflict major damage on the United States within 5 years of a decision to do so. Iraq, a rogue state that has constantly challenged its neighbors, the United States, and the international community militarily for two decades now, so the Rumsfeld Commission said, could inflict major damage on the United States within 10 years. The Commission warned that the ability of our intelligence community to provide timely and accurate warning of attempts to produce ballistic missiles was eroding. \\n   So a problem is growing, with the capacity of the intelligence community to warn us of its forward movement eroded. And then the Rumsfeld Commission predicted prophetically, as it turned out, that Iran would soon deploy a Shahab-3 missile on the way to developing intercontinental ballistic missile capability and that North Korea would soon have a missile capable of hitting Alaska or Hawaii. \\n   Well, unfortunately, the Rumsfeld Commission was right on target. Within a month of its report, Iran did flight test the Shahab-3 missile, and 1 month later North Korea launched its Taepo Dong missiles. We had long known North Korea had strong missile technology. Analysts were broadly surprised that the Taepo Dong was a three-stage missile with enough range to hit parts of the United States of America. \\n   The Iranian and North Korean missile tests validated two of the Rumsfeld Commission\\'s findings. First, that rogue states are in possession of missiles that threaten American territory; and, second, that these states have developed this capability far more rapidly than we had assumed possible and with very little warning. \\n   Recent events in places such as North Korea and Iran have contributed to a revision and updated a speeding up of the administration\\'s approach to missile defense, and I appreciate that acceleration very much. Just a few months ago, in January of this year, Secretary of Defense Cohen announced that the administration would seek $6.6 billion over 5 years to field a limited national missile defense. \\n   Secretary Cohen explained:  \\n   We are affirming that there is a threat and the threat is growing, and that it will pose a danger not only to our troops overseas but also to Americans here at home.  \\n   The Taepo Dong I test was another strong indicator that the United States will, in fact, face a rogue nation missile threat to our homeland against which we will have to defend the American people.  \\n   The bill before us today, S. 257, is designed to respond to that very real threat that rogue states and organizations with missile technology pose to our Nation. S. 257 states what I think we all believe, which is that we should take action to protect ourselves against this threat. We would be derelict in our duty if we did not. I view S. 257 as a statement of policy, a statement of policy that it is the intention of the United States of America, the administration, executive branch, Members of Congress, shoulder to shoulder together, to develop a defense to this threat which could be a cataclysmic threat that we all seem to agree we are now facing. \\n   So I must admit that I am disappointed by the disagreement that still exists over this measure. The statement of policy that came from the Clinton administration in January of this year seems to me to be reflected in and consistent with the simple statement embodied in S. 257. And yet, there is opposition. I hope that the debate and discussion that we are having today and the days ahead will lead us to find a way to express what I believe we all feel: The threat is real and we have to do something about it as quickly as possible. \\n   As I understand the concerns of the administration and my colleagues in the Senate who oppose S. 257, they are as follows: They argue that this bill considers only technological feasibility in making a commitment now to deploy a national missile defense without taking into account the actual threat, the operation, the effectiveness of the system against a threat, the affordability of the system, including the balance of other critical defense needs, and the impact of the policy stated in this bill on nuclear weapons reductions and arms control efforts particularly with Russia. \\n   I know that some are also concerned that S. 257 contradicts the administration\\'s policy of not deciding on deployment until June of 2000 after a series of tests. Some also fear that this bill will make it less likely that the Russians would continue arms control negotiations. Some still feel that since the administration has budgeted $6.6 billion for national missile defense development and deployment, S. 257 is not necessary and will not advance the deployment deadline, as the effort is technology constrained, not policy or resource constrained. And there are others who say that this response does not help defend against the most likely methods of delivery such as maritime vessels. \\n   Of course, the most likely methods of delivery, if they are in fact the most likely methods of delivery such as maritime vessels, if I may start with the last argument, should only lead us to want to accelerate the development of a limited defense because delivery from the water, from the oceans may speed up the date by which the United States will be vulnerable to this attack. \\n   Let me try to respond to some of the arguments that have been made. First, while it is true that S. 257 does state that the United States should deploy a limited national missile defense when technologically feasible, that is a broad statement of policy which does not preclude consideration of other important factors. It simply says--and I hope when I join with Senator COCHRAN, Senator INOUYE and others, that it would be a broad enough statement of policy--that it would lead a broad bipartisan majority to feel comfortable coming to its support. \\n   The fact is that we will consider questions of affordability and other questions each year, as we in Congress carry out our responsibility to authorize and appropriate with regard to a limited national missile defense and other defense programs, to decide how to proceed and how much money to devote to the program. To me, that is implicit in the bill, because it is inherent in the legislative process. A policy statement saying that it is our intent to deploy a national missile defense when technologically feasible doesn\\'t mean it will happen automatically or overnight, it doesn\\'t mean that Congress will be precluded from participation in the program and that the Ballistic Missile Defense Office will essentially be given a blank check. Quite the contrary. Each year we will authorize--which this bill does not do; it is a policy statement--and we will appropriate, which this bill most certainly does not do. \\n   Though I think that is clear from the wording in S. 257, I am very pleased to be a cosponsor of the amendment which has been laid down by the Senator from Mississippi which makes clear that this policy that we would declare in S. 257 is subject to the annual authorization and appropriations process. \\n   As to the question of the administration\\'s policy or plan to make a judgment about deployment in June of 2000 based on some tests that will be done by then--four tests, I believe, that would be done by then--to me the bill before us neither negates nor endorses that policy. In fact, under the bill before us, it is possible that the decision to deploy would not be made until well after June of 2000, because the threshold of technological feasibility, technological possibility, would not have been reached. But the fact that we are not ready now to deploy a system surely cannot mean that we should not now declare our policy to deploy such a system, to get ready to defend our territory and our people as soon as possible. In fact, we should declare that policy unequivocally, and I think this bill, S. 257, gives us the opportunity to do that. \\n   Let me now talk of the concerns about the impact that passage of this bill will have on our relations with Russia and particularly on arms control negotiations that are going on with Russia. I have long supported those negotiations, they are so clearly and palpably in our national security interests. They have run into obstacles along the way--START agreements ran into political difficulties in the Russian Duma. But of course we are part of a process in which we are trying to move those forward in our national security interests. \\n   But I must say, I fail to see how passage of this measure, in which we in the U.S. Senate would be declaring our intention to develop a limited national missile defense, should be stopped by our concern about what I believe is a misunderstanding or misapprehension, if in fact it exists, in Russia, about our intentions here. In all the debate and discussion I have heard about the development of a national missile defense, a limited national missile defense, I have not heard anybody--certainly I have not, Senator COCHRAN has not, Senator INOUYE has not--suggest that the country we are developing this defense against is Russia. \\n   The countries we are developing this defense against are rogue nations, subnational groups that may attempt to inflict harm, intimidate us, leverage us to extract compromises on our national security from our leadership--not Russia. In fact, I believe the administration has spoken these words to the \\n   Russians. \\n   We have common enemies here in these rogue states. This system is not being developed against the nations of the former Soviet Union or Russia. This is not star wars. Star wars was aimed at--speaking simplistically, if I may--putting a security umbrella over the United States to protect us from a massive ICBM attack from the Soviet Union. This is a highly limited system aimed at trying to preserve a measure of security for our people against limited missile attack from rogue nations. \\n   So I am puzzled and troubled about why we should not simply state our policy to develop a defense of our homeland against rogue nations because there may be some in Russia who misunderstand our intention. We understand that doing so will compromise the ABM Treaty, negotiated in a very different context for very different reasons more than a quarter of a century ago at the height of the cold war. That is why top level officials of our administration have already begun to speak with the Russians about our intention. It is clearly evident from the policy that Secretary Cohen articulated in January, clearly evident from the additional billions of dollars that President Clinton has put into the defense budget in the coming years to accelerate our development of a national missile defense. But I, for one, would feel irresponsible--put it another way. I would feel we had not worked hard enough to reassure the Russians that this national missile defense that we state in  this measure that we intend to build is not aimed at them. It is aimed at common enemies that they and we have. \\n   The fact is, in some measure the content of S. 257 is an honest expression to the leadership in Russia, with whom we are working on so many different matters, that this has now become a matter of American national policy--self defense. And, as much as we value good relations with Russia, as much as we adhere to our treaty obligations, we are saying to them here that we have made a judgment in our own national self-interest and self-defense that we must develop a limited national missile defense and therefore we must begin, as we have, to renegotiate the ABM Treaty. But to not go ahead with this policy statement for fear of the way it will be misread in Russia seems to me to be an underestimation of both our relationship and of our ability to speak truth to the Russians and of their ability to understand it. \\n   So, mindful as I am, respectful as I am of the importance of ongoing arms control negotiations with the Russians, I think we do not serve our national interests if we yield to that misapprehension when we know that this system is not being developed to defend against hostile action by them. \\n   Mr. President, we need the national missile defense. We face a real and growing threat that cannot be countered by our conventional forces and which will not be deterred by the threat of retaliation. Remember, Russia, on whom we are focused in our judgment on this measure--and some are focused to the extent that they will oppose it because of concerns in Russia--we and the Russian-dominated Soviet Union reached this meeting of minds during a cold war that we were each rational enough to be deterred by the threat of massive retaliation. Deterrence, after all, requires rationality. By definition, accidental, unauthorized, or rogue acts are not the acts of rational leaders and cannot be reliably deterred. \\n   Thus, we have a choice: Either we will endure the possibility of limited missile attack on our country with weapons of mass destruction, or we will commit ourselves, with all that we have in us, and will state so honestly in this measure, that we are going to do everything we can to defend against such an attack. \\n   I don\\'t agree that this measure is not needed. It is needed. It is a clarion statement of policy about a critical national security vulnerability at an important transitional period in our national history. The fact is, its very existence has already acted as a catalyst in moving this debate forward, the debate about the threat. After all, congressional concern about this led to the Rumsfeld Commission, which led to the report, which predicted the North Korean-Iranian action, which now has led to a coming closer together between congressional opinion and administration policy. \\n   Mr. President, both sides in this debate are, after all is said and done, separated by very little. A critical national security decision such as this should not be partisan. The amendment that Senator COCHRAN and I and others, I believe Senators WARNER and INOUYE, put down, which makes clear what was implicit before, that S. 257 will naturally be subjected to the annual authorization and appropriations process, makes clear that Congress each year will consider the affordability, the extent of the threat, the impact funding of this system has on other defense needs, and even the impact of the level of funding on our relations with Russia and other arms control negotiations. \\n   I think that defending against limited missile attacks is something that all of us, both parties, 100 strong, clearly want to do. I take it that the disagreement is how to do it and what we should express, if anything, in a statement of policy. This is such an important matter and at such a critical moment that I hope in this debate we will listen to each other, that we will reason together, and that we will ultimately come up with a proposal here that a broad bipartisan majority can support. \\n   I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor. \\n   Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990304\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am delighted to join today with my colleagues Senator CHAFEE, the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, and Senators MACK, WARNER, MOYNIHAN, REID, WYDEN, JEFFORDS, BIDEN, BAUCUS, and COLLINS in introducing this important legislation. The point of this bi-partisan legislation is simple. It will provide credit, under any future greenhouse gas reduction systems we choose to adopt, to companies who act now to reduce their emissions. This is a voluntary, market-based approach that is a win-win situation for both American businesses and the environment. \\n   Many companies want to move forward now to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. They don\\'t want to wait until legislation requires them to make these reductions. For some companies reducing greenhouse gases makes good economic sense because adopting cost-effective solutions can actually save them money by improving the efficiency of their operations. Companies recognize that if they reduce their greenhouse gas emissions now they will be able to add years to any potential compliance schedule, allowing them to spread their investment costs over a longer span of time. Under this legislation, businesses will have the flexibility to innovate and develop expertise regarding the most cost-effective ways in which their particular company can become part of the solution to the problem of greenhouse gas emissions. \\n   This bill ensures that companies will be credited in future reduction proposals for actions taken now, thereby removing impediments preventing some voluntary efforts that would provide large environmental benefits. Focusing American ingenuity on early reductions will also help stimulate the search for and use of new, innovative strategies and technologies that are needed to enable companies both in this country and worldwide meet their reduction requirements in a cost-effective manner. Development of such strategies and technologies will improve American competitiveness in the more than $300 billion global environmental marketplace. \\n   Early action by U.S. companies will begin creating very important environmental benefits now. By providing the certainty necessary to encourage companies to move forward with emission reductions, this legislation will lead to immediate reductions in greenhouse gas pollution. Once emitted, many greenhouse gases continue to trap heat in the atmosphere for a century or more. Early reductions can begin to slow the rate of buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, helping to minimize the environmental risks of continued global warming. It just makes sense to encourage practical action now. \\n   The bill will help us deal with the serious threat posed by global climate change. Emissions of greenhouse gases that result from human activity, particularly the combustion of fossil fuels, are causing greenhouse gases to accumulate in the atmosphere above natural levels. More than 2,500 of the world\\'s best scientific and technical experts have concluded that this increase threatens to change the balance of temperature and precipitation that we rely on for a host of economic and societal activities. The American Geophysical Union, a professional society comprised 35,000 geoscientists, recently stated that ``present understanding of the Earth climate system provides a compelling basis for legitimate public concern over future global- and regional-scale changes resulting from increased concentrations of greenhouse gases.\\'\\' \\n   We recently learned from scientists that 1998 was the hottest year on record and that nine of the hottest ten years occurred in the past decade. Scientists believe that a rise in global temperature may in turn result in sea level rise and changes in weather patterns, food and fiber production, human health, and ecosystems. Beyond the science that we know, our common sense tells us that the risks associated with climate change are serious. Weather-related disasters already cost our economy billions of dollars every year. \\n   The climate agreement reached in Kyoto, Japan in 1997 was an historic agreement that provided the foundation for an international solution to climate change. The protocol included important provisions, fought for by American negotiators, aimed at establishing real targets and timetables for achieving emissions reductions and providing flexibility and market mechanisms for reducing compliance costs as we work to limit our emissions of greenhouse gases. In Buenos Aires last year, the international community began developing the details of the protocol. I had the privilege of participating as a Senate observer at both the Kyoto and Buenos Aires climate change conventions. I was particularly encouraged that developing countries, including Argentina and Kazakstan, indicated their willingness in Buenos Aires to limit the growth of their greenhouse gas emissions. Nations of the world are all coming to recognize that climate change is an issue of grave international concern and that all members of the global community must participate in solving the problem. \\n   Unfortunately, the current atmosphere in Congress is such that some  would block any steps related to climate change until the Kyoto protocol is ratified by the Senate. President Clinton has said he will not submit the Kyoto protocol for ratification until developing countries demonstrate meaningful participation. I am encouraged by the progress made in Buenos Aires and am proud that the United States, by signing the protocol, is committed to a leadership role in the global effort to protect our Earth\\'s irreplaceable natural environment. But to defer debate and action on any proposal that might reduce greenhouse gases until after Senate consideration of the protocol is to deny the United States the ability to act in its own economic and environmental self-interest. The issue at stake is how to develop an insurance policy to protect us against the danger of climate change. Regardless of our individual views on the Kyoto protocol, we in Congress must focus our debate on the issue of climate change and work to forge agreement on how we can move forward. Unfortunately, we have done too little to attack the escalating emissions of greenhouse gases which threaten our health, our safety and our homes. \\n   I\\'m particularly pleased that the legislation grows out of principles developed in a dialogue between the Environmental Defense Fund and a number of major industries. I am encouraged that since the introduction of a similar version of this bill last year, we have received many constructive comments from those in the business and environmental communities. Many good suggestions are on the table now and we expect that many are yet to come; we welcome broad participation as we move forward on this legislation. I am committed to working through some of the important issues that have been raised. Indeed, I believe that it will be through the ongoing constructive participation of the widest spectrum of stakeholders that we will enact a law that catalyzes American action on climate change and delivers on the promise of crediting voluntary early actions. \\n   I hope that my colleagues and their constituents will take an honest and hard look at this initiative and consider working with us to improve and advance good legislation that begins to address the profound threat of global climate change. This legislation alone will not protect us from the consequences of climate change, but it is a constructive and necessary step in the right direction. I believe that it is crucial that we begin to address the important issue of climate change now because we have a moral obligation to leave our children and grandchildren a vibrant, healthy, and productive planet and thriving global economy. \\n   Mr. President, the debate about climate change is too often vested--and I believe wrongly so--in false choices between scientific findings, common sense, business investments and environmental awareness. The approach of this bill again demonstrates that these are not mutually exclusive choices, but highly compatible goals. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990303\\n\\n    Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Rabbi Alvin Wainhaus of Congregation Or Shalom in Orange, Connecticut. On March 19th and 20th, he will be honored by Congregation Or Shalom on his 18th anniversary as spiritual leader of the synagogue. \\n   This is a significant milestone for Rabbi Wainhaus and his congregation. Through his leadership at Congregation Or Shalom he has constantly worked to reach out to every member of the congregation, young and old, and keep them involved in all aspects of congregation life. He has particularly reached out to young adults as they have left home for college and careers in order to keep them connected to their families and community. \\n   He has helped provide guidance and insight to innumerable people not just at Congregation Or Shalom but within the community as a whole. We currently face difficult times, and it is our families and friends, combined with our churches and synagogues, that provide the support systems which allow us to confront and overcome the challenges set before us. Through his service, Rabbi Wainhaus has helped many families over the years surmount these obstacles and make positive contributions to their communities. \\n   As this congregation has grown over the years, with God\\'s divine assistance, Rabbi Wainhaus has touched many lives throughout the community. The people of Connecticut thank Rabbi Wainhaus for his service, dedication, and contribution to our state.  \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990303\\n\\n    Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a young man who made the ultimate sacrifice for his community. Officer Brian Aselton of the East Hartford Police Department lost his life on January 23, 1999 when he responded to a noise complaint call that turned out to be anything but routine. Instead, Brian became the eleventh Connecticut police officer killed in the line of duty in the last ten years. \\n   This tragedy has touched the entire region; more than ten thousand civilians and law enforcement officials attended Brian\\'s funeral. We have all tried to come to terms with the utter senselessness of his death. Brian was a young man at the start of a promising career with a supportive nucleus of family and friends. Truly, he embodied the determination, strength, and spirit that is such an integral part of our nation\\'s history. Yet, in an instant, Brian\\'s life and the lives of everyone who loved him changed forever. \\n   Every law enforcement officer puts his or her life on the line to protect citizens every day. Too often, we as civilians forget the dangers of the occupation and do not show these brave and dedicated officers the respect they deserve. Officer Aselton, killed in the line of duty, serves as a solemn reminder to us all of the responsibility borne by police officers across the state and nation. Every day, the men and women in uniform put their lives at risk so that we can live in communities where we and our families can feel safe. And unfortunately, it takes a tragic event like this for us to truly understand the dedication of these peace officers to the neighborhoods they serve. \\n   With the support of the East Hartford Police Department and other officers across the region, the Aselton family has begun the necessary healing process. Yet, with his loss, the town of East Hartford and the State of Connecticut have been diminished. At Brian\\'s funeral, everyone joined together across municipal and state borders and stood together as a single family honoring one of our own. Now that Brian is gone, it is incumbent on us to maintain those bonds. Each one of us must recognize that we are all part of the same family and the simple things important to us are also the simple things important to our neighbors. These are the personal steps that we should take to truly honor his memory. If we can each devote the same commitment to these principles that Brian devoted to his duties as a police officer, we will, through our progress as a society, have made some sense out of his untimely death.  \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990224\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, S. 4 is a worthy attempt to address the growing problem the military is encountering in attracting and retaining the right men and women in the right numbers. As the challenges facing us demonstrate, the effectiveness of our military, and its readiness to act immediately to protect our national interests, must always be a priority concern of Congress. The outstanding performance of our forces in Desert Fox shows that the American military remains more than equal to any task and may in fact be the best force the United States has ever fielded. Even at the height of the cold war, with the largest military budgets ever, it is difficult to imagine those units routinely coping with the range of complex military operations accomplished by our military today. \\n   Nonetheless, our military faces readiness problems including falling recruitment and retention in critical skill areas; aging equipment that costs more to keep operating at acceptable levels of reliability; a need for more support services for a force with a high percentage of married personnel; and frequent deployments. The Department of Defense deserves credit for highlighting these problems, the administration deserves credit for increasing the budget to address them and, our colleagues, who have crafted this bill, deserve credit for bringing these issues into clear focus. \\n   This legislation is commendable in its attempt to increase resources to address and solve the myriad problems facing today\\'s military forces, specifically pay and benefits. However, we should not do something in a hurry that we will have cause to regret at leisure. The many detailed provisions in this proposed legislation have not been fully vetted by the services, the Joint Staff, the Secretary of Defense or this body. What we spend money on, is as important, as how much money we spend. We must have a plan to spend available funds wisely. \\n   I believe this legislation is premature, and I will vote against it at this time for three reasons. First, there is no doubt that adequately compensating our most valuable resource, our service men and women, is the wisest use of our defense dollars. But we must also ensure we have a sensible and executable procurement strategy for today and tomorrow. We must find the right balance given finite resources. Therefore, I believe more analysis is needed on the most favorable, most cost efficient way to compensate today\\'s force. This bill would add more money, but I am not yet convinced we have a good idea of where more money will work best. A case in point, historically, pilot retention has been difficult, and the numbers of pilots for our future force is projected to be considerably less than required. This problem was highlighted specifically in the recent readiness hearings. However, even as we prepare to redo the pay scale and improve the retirement pay, the take rate for pilot bonuses is reportedly increasing. So, where is the best place for additional funds--redux, improved pay scale, further bonuses, better quality of life advancements--what makes the most sense? Furthermore, we need to discuss and examine the impact of this proposed legislation on other \\n   government workers. What about the recruitment and retention of our dedicated civilian force? \\n   Next, as we prepare to spend money to ensure our force is compensated and ready, we must ask: ``ready for what?\\'\\' Which men and women do we most need to recruit and retain, and are we ready for them now? If we spend more than we must for people and less than we should for the tools they need, we will create new problems. For instance, we need more pilots, but we do not yet have an adequate number of aircraft to train them. Should we recruit them and then keep them ``grounded\\'\\' because we haven\\'t funded the equipment to allow them to fly. Readiness in 1999 will not necessarily be readiness in the future. We must ensure our forces are ready to address challenges in the near term as well to challenges that emerge over the longer term. \\n   Finally, besides deciding how best to spend the available funds, we must find the available funds. We do not know what this bill will actually cost. Before we act, we should know more clearly what the cost will be, and where the funds will come from. Many of the provisions offered in this legislation differ from the Pentagon\\'s request, adding costs that must be absorbed from other programs. As the Administration, and Secretary Cohen have pointed out, the money projected to be added to the defense budget, or any foreseeable increase, will not be enough to completely cover current readiness increases and meet the modernization requirements of all the services. With the proposed pay raises, higher cost-of-living adjustments and other miscellaneous items it is estimated that S. 4 will cost an additional $7 billion in discretionary funding through FY 2005, and absent an increase in the topline for Defense, these items will only displace other key elements of the Defense program. \\n   Furthermore, while searching for the appropriate amount of money, we must demand 100% cost effectiveness, and the elimination of waste and redundancy. We must do the appropriate analysis and make the tough choices, to include examining the possibility of closing down military facilities that don\\'t make military-economic sense any more. The Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs must be allowed to evaluate this legislation, it\\'s cost and, then ask where they would choose to take the risk if it comes to that. \\n   Major studies on military pay and pension issues by the Congressional Budget Office, the Government Accounting Organization, and the Defense Department are nearing completion, with all reports expected to be released by late spring. Upon release and examination of these reports, we will be better able to judge the needs in these areas and how best to respond to them. I urge that instead of deciding on this legislation today, we expeditiously arrange appropriate hearings to analyze these ideas in the context of the entire defense authorization bill. This bill is a great point of departure, it is not a final product. We have not yet done the critical analysis to know where the priority should go within the broad category of pay and allowances to most effectively attract and retain the right people. We do not know how a separate bill of this type will impact the authorization process for other programs, ultimately affecting the hard questions of long-term readiness. \\n   So, though I strongly favor increases in pay and benefits for our military, this bill is premature and therefore I will reluctantly vote against it. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990212\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. Chief Justice, throughout the history of this great country, we have endured trials that have strained the sinews of our democracy and sometimes even threatened to tear apart our unparalleled experiment in self-government. Each time the nation has returned to the Constitution as our common lodestar, trusting in its vision, its values and its ultimate verity. Each time we have emerged from these tests stronger, more resilient, more certain of Daniel Webster\\'s claim of ``one country, one constitution, one destiny.\\'\\' (Speech to a Whig Party rally in New York City, March 15, 1837.) And each time our awe of the Founders\\' genius has been renewed, as has our reverence for the brilliantly-calibrated instrument they crafted to guide their political progeny in the unending challenge of governing as a free people. \\n   At this moment, we face a test that, although not as grave or perilous as some before, is nevertheless unlike anything this nation has ever experienced. As my colleagues well know, the impeachment trial of William Jefferson Clinton marks the first time in our history that the United States Senate has convened as a court of impeachment to consider removing an elected President from office. But what also makes this trial unprecedented are the underlying charges against President Clinton, which stem directly from his private sexual behavior. The facts of this case are complicated, embarrassing, demoralizing, and infuriating. They raise questions that Madison, Hamilton, and their brethren could never have anticipated that the Senate would have to address in the solemn context of impeachment. \\n   The public examination of these difficult questions--about private and public morality, about the role of the Independent Counsel, and about our expectations of Presidential conduct--has been a wrenching, dispiriting and at times unseemly process for the nation. It has divided us as parties and as a people, reaching its nadir in the partisan bickering and badgering that unfortunately defined the impeachment vote in the House of Representatives and compromised the legitimacy of this process in the eyes of many Americans. It has set off a frenzy in the news media that has degraded and devalued our public discourse and badly eroded the traditional boundaries between public and private life, leaving a pornographer to assume the role or arbiter of our political mores. And it has so alienated the American people that many of them are hardly paying attention to a trial that could result in the most radical disruption of the presidency--excepting assassination--in our nation\\'s history. \\n   Yet despite the significant pain this trauma has caused for the country, I take heart from the fact that we have once again reaffirmed our commitment to the Constitution and the fundamental principles underpinning it. The conduct of the trial here in the Senate has been passionate at times, but never uncivil, and while some votes have broken along party lines, they have never broken the spirit of common purpose we share. Indeed, throughout the past several weeks we as a body have grown closer as we have continually measured our actions with the same constitutional yardstick, and each of us has sought to remain faithful to the Founders\\' vision as we understand it in fulfilling our responsibilities as triers of the President. This, I believe, is in the end a remarkable testament to the foresight of our forefathers, that even in this most unusual of crises, we could and would rely on the Constitution as our compass to find a peaceable and just resolution. \\n   We are about to achieve that resolution and complete our constitutional responsibilities \\n   by rendering a judgment, a profound judgment, about the conduct of President Clinton and the call of the House of Representatives to remove him from office. This is the duty we accepted when we swore to do ``impartial justice,\\'\\' and it is a duty that I, as each of you, have pondered night and day since this trial began. \\n   As I have stated previously on this Senate floor, I have been deeply disappointed and angered by this President\\'s conduct--that which is covered in the Articles, and the more personal misbehavior that is not--and like all of us here, I have struggled uncomfortably for more than a year with how to  respond to it. President Clinton engaged in an extramarital sexual relationship with a young White House employee in the Oval Office, which, though consensual, was irresponsible and immoral, and thus raised serious questions about his judgment and his respect for the high office he holds. He then made false or misleading statements about that relationship to the American people, to a Federal district court judge in a civil deposition, and to a Federal grand jury; in so doing, he betrayed not only his family but the public\\'s trust, and undermined his moral authority and public credibility. \\n   But the judgment we must now make is not about the rightness or wrongness of the President\\'s relationship with Monica Lewinsky and his efforts to conceal it. Nor is that judgment about whether the President is guilty of committing a specific crime. That may be determined by a criminal court, which the Senate clearly is not, after he leaves office. \\n   No, the question before us now is whether the President\\'s conduct--as alleged in the two articles of impeachment--makes his continuance in office a threat to our government, our people, and the national interest. That, I conclude, is the extraordinarily high bar the Framers set for removal of a duly-elected President, and it is that standard we must apply to the facts to determine whether the President is guilty of ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\\'\\' \\n   Each side has had ample opportunity to present its case, illuminating the voluminous record from the House, and we Senators have been able to ask wide-ranging questions of both parties. The House was also authorized to conduct depositions of the three witnesses it deemed most important to its case. I have listened intently throughout, watched the videotaped depositions, and been very impressed by both the House Managers and the counsel for the President. The House Managers, for their part, have presented the facts and argued the Constitution so effectively that they impelled me more than once to seriously consider voting for removal. \\n   But after much reflection and review of the extensive evidence before us, of the meaning of the term ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors,\\'\\' and, most importantly, of the best interests of the nation, I have concluded that the facts do not meet the high standard the Founders established for conviction and removal. No matter how deeply disappointed I am that our President, who has worked so successfully to lift up the lives of so many people, so lowered himself and his office, I conclude that his wrongdoing in this sordid saga does not justify making him the first President to be ousted from office in our history. I will therefore vote against both Articles of Impeachment. \\n   In reaching the judgment that President Clinton is not guilty of high crimes or misdemeanors, I started from the same premise that the Founders did--the right of the people \\n   to choose their leaders is paramount in America, derived directly, as Thomas Jefferson wrote in the Declaration of Independence, from the equality of rights endowed to the people by our Creator. The supremacy of this first democratic principle was well described by Alexis De Tocqueville in Democracy in America: ``The people reign in the American political world as the Deity does in the universe. They are the cause and the aim of all things; everything comes from them, and everything is absorbed in them.\\'\\' (Heffner ed. 1956 p. 58) \\n   In debating the President\\'s fate, we must remember that we are deciding is whether to supersede the people\\'s decision about who should lead them--to substitute our judgment for theirs. On this point, the Framers of the Constitution were clear. They had boldly rejected the autocratic rule of a monarch and put in his place a President elected by, and accountable to, the people. Their deliberations show that they did not want even the legislature to exercise too much control over he popularly-chosen President. The Framers provided impeachment to serve as the narrowest of escape valves in the most extreme of cases. As a result, they set an extraordinarily high bar--both procedurally and substantively--for Congress to overcome before we, rather than the voters, could remove a President from office. \\n   Specifically, they required a majority of the House of Representatives to impeach and permitted removal only upon the concurrence of two-thirds of the Senate--which the Framers surely knew, and the current proceedings have demonstrated, is exceedingly difficult to obtain. They also established a very strict substantive standard, authorizing the Congress to remove a President from office only upon ``Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\\'\\' (U.S. Constitution, Art. II, sec. 4) \\n   The first time I read that clause, ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors,\\'\\' I assumed it included any criminal offense--and only criminal offenses--and I thought that it gave Congress broad latitude to impeach and remove from office a President who had committed any violation of the criminal code. But the more I studied the history, the less clear that interpretation became. The phrase ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors\\'\\' was a term of art to the Framers, and it meant something very different from ordinary crimes, the response to which must be left to the criminal justice system. The Framers chose the term high crimes, to connote a very specific type of offense, like treason or bribery, which has a direct impact on the government and undermines the chief executive\\'s ability or will to continue serving without corruption and in the national interest. As Alexander Hamilton explained in the Federalist Papers, high crimes and misdemeanors are ``those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust. They are of a nature which may with peculiar propriety be denominated political, as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself.\\'\\' (The Federalist Papers, No. 65 Rossiter ed. 1961 p. 396 (emphasis in original)) \\n   It is not necessary here to offer a lengthy dissertation on the Constitutional Convention\\'s impeachment debates. But I would like to share a statement of James Madison that illuminates the reasons why the Framers wanted to authorize impeachment and removal, as well as the intended scope of that power. In response to the suggestion that it was dangerous to authorize the legislature to remove the President, Madison argued that it was:  \\n   indispensable that some provision should be made by defending the Community against the incapacity, negligence or perfidy of the chief Magistrate. The limitation of the period of his service, was not a sufficient security. He might lose his capacity after his appointment. He might pervert his administration into a scheme of peculation or oppression. He might betray his trust to foreign powers . . . In the case of the Executive Magistracy which was to be administered by a single man, loss of capacity or corruption was more within the compass of probable events, and either of them might be fatal to the Republic. (II Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, pp. 65-66 (Farrand ed. 1888))  \\n   ``Loss of capacity or corruption\\'\\'--that is the evil at which the Constitution\\'s impeachment clauses were directed, in Madison\\'s view. \\n   Although neither the words of the Constitution nor the writings of Hamilton, Madison or any of the other Framers of the Constitution provide a precise list of those offenses that prove ``the abuse or violation of some public trust,\\'\\' or the ``loss of capacity or corruption\\'\\' that would constitute ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors,\\'\\' their words and our history offer some help in supplying a more detailed meaning to those terms. \\n   First, the Framers saw impeachment as an extreme remedy meant to respond to only a limited universe of offenses. They took great care to ensure that their chosen substantive standard did not have the effect of providing Congress so much discretion over the President\\'s fate that it could use its power to infringe on the President\\'s independence. It was for this precise reason that Madison successfully argued against allowing for removal for ``maladministration,\\'\\' for fear that ``[s]o vague a term will be equivalent to a tenure during pleasure of the Senate.\\'\\' (II Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, p. 550 (Farrand ed. 1888)) \\n   Second, pervading the Framers\\' discussions--and the Constitutional language they ultimately adopted--was the view that impeachment was intended to protect the nation and the national interest and not to provide the legislature an alternative to the  criminal justice system for holding accountable the President or any other violator of the nation\\'s criminal laws. In crafting our Constitution\\'s impeachment clauses, the Framers specifically and consciously departed from the English practice, in which Parliament could use its impeachment power to impose criminal sanctions. Emphasizing that the legislative branch has no constitutional role whatsoever in meting out punishment, whether for the Chief Executive or any other citizen, was so important to the Framers that they declared it not once, but twice in the Constitution--first when they outlawed bills of attainder (Art. I, sec. 9, cl. 3), and again when they emphasized that ``Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law\\'\\' (Art. I, sec. 3, cl. 7). \\n   It is this linguistically-driven irony--that the Constitution\\'s impeachment clauses employ the language of criminal law to authorize a process entirely outside of and distinct from the criminal justice system--that has created so much confusion over our precise task here. The House Managers often appear to suggest that if they show that the President committed a crime, then they have met their burden, because it is our responsibility to hold accountable a President who violates the law and to send a message that the President is not above the law. \\n   But as Professor Charles Black so well explained in Impeachment: A Handbook, criminality in and of itself is neither a necessary nor a sufficient basis for concluding that a President has committed a high crime or misdemeanor, because our goal is to protect the nation\\'s interests, not to punish a President for violating the criminal law. He states: ``I think we can say that `high Crimes or Misdemeanors,\\' in the constitutional sense, ought to be held to be those offenses which are rather obviously wrong, whether or not `criminal,\\' and which so seriously threaten the order of political society as to make pestilent and dangerous the continuance in power of their perpetrator. The fact that such an act is also criminal helps, even if it is not \\n    essential, because a general societal view of wrongness, and sometimes of seriousness, is, in such a case, publicly and authoritatively recorded.\\'\\' (1998 ed. pp. 39-40) \\n   If the purpose of impeachment was to ensure that the President is held accountable for violating the law, then the Framers would have authorized Congress to impeach and remove, not just for high crimes but for any crimes. They did not do that. They gave us the power of impeachment and removal for one reason and one reason only: to protect the Republic from a Chief Executive who, by his acts, has demonstrated that he can no longer be trusted to govern in the national interest. Responses to all other forms of malfeasance were left to the other branches. \\n   That is why I conclude that the appropriate question for each of us to ask is not whether the President committed perjury or obstruction of justice, but whether he committed a high crime or misdemeanor--a term I understand from the history to encompass two categories of offenses. The first includes those that are like treason or bribery in that they represent a gross misuse of official power to directly injure the State or its people. Those guilty of such offenses must be removed from office because they have explicitly demonstrated, by their conduct, that they will place their personal interests above the national interest. \\n   The President\\'s counsel and others suggest that we should stop here, arguing that Congress has no authority to remove a President for any offense not committed through the use of official power. (See Trial Memorandum of President Clinton pp. 19-20) I cannot agree. Instead, Madison\\'s argument that we must have an escape valve that allows the legislature to remove a President when the need arises to defend ``the Community against the incapacity, negligence, or perfidy of the chief Magistrate,\\'\\' coupled with Hamilton\\'s definition of ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors\\'\\' as an ``abuse or violation of some public trust,\\'\\' convince me that it is more than just misuse of official power that can require the Senate to remove an office holder. Acts that, although in their immediate nature and effect differ from treason or bribery because they do not stem from a misuse of official power, may nevertheless undermine the offender\\'s ability to discharge his duties in the interests of the American people. In other words, the second category of offenses that equal ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors\\'\\' are non-official acts that unequivocally demonstrate the same threat posed by treason or bribery: that the President can no longer be trusted to use his power in the best interests of the nation. \\n   It is for this reason that I reject the contention that a President\\'s giving false or misleading statements under oath or his impeding the discovery of evidence in a lawsuit arising out of his personal conduct may never constitute a high crime or misdemeanor. I have no doubt that under certain circumstances such offenses could demonstrate such a level of depravity, deceit and disregard for the administration of justice that we would have no choice but to conclude that the President could no longer be trusted to use the authority of his office and make the decisions entrusted to him as Chief Executive in the best interest of the nation. It is because I hold this position that I found reaching a decision in this case such a difficult matter. \\n   Before evaluating the charges against the President, and determining whether his misconduct in fact meets the high threshold the Constitution establishes for removal, each of us had to resolve the important question of what standard of proof should be used for judging the \\n   evidence against the President. It is widely agreed that the House Managers have the burden of convincing Members of the Senate that the President has committee a high crime or misdemeanor, but there are differences of opinion on the level of certainly each of us in the Senate must reach before we can conclude that the House has met its burden. \\n   During the Impeachment Trial of Judge Alcee Hastings, I gave a great deal of thought to this question, and after weighing the competing interests of preserving the integrity of the judiciary, maintaining the independence of the judiciary, and protecting the personal interests of the office holder, I concluded that the House had to prove it case by ``clear and convincing evidence.\\'\\' (See 135 Cong. Rec. S 14359-61 (Oct. 27, 1989)) Clear and convincing evidence is evidence that, in one formulation, produces in the mind ``a firm belief or conviction as to the matter at issue\\'\\' (U.S. Fifth Circuit District Judges Association, Pattern Jury Instructions §2.14 (1998 ed.)) or, put another way, persuades the finder of fact that the claim ``is highly probable\\'\\' (Committee on Model Jury Instructions, Ninth Circuit Manual of Model Jury Instructions §1.12.2 (1997 ed.)). \\n   There are valid arguments for adopting the higher standard of ``beyond a reasonable doubt\\'\\' in this case, most importantly that the national trauma caused by the removal of a President so far surpasses the damage imposed by the removal of a single judge, that the Senate must remove a President only if it has a very high degree of certainty in the facts underlying its decision. On the other hand, just as the trauma of removing a President is greater than that flowing from removing a judge, the danger an errant President poses to the Republic far exceeds the threat presented by a misbehaving judge. This need to protect the integrity of the Republic and the welfare of its people argues against setting the standard of proof so high that it would result in leaving in power an individual whose fitness to continue serving in the national interest is seriously in doubt, remembering that no matter what the standard, removal still requires two-thirds of the Senators\\' support. \\n   In 1974, then Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield recommended that the standard of ``clear and convincing evidence\\'\\' was ``a logical middle ground between the burden of proof requirement in criminal proceedings (`beyond a reasonable doubt\\') and the burden of proof requirement in civil proceedings (`by a preponderance of the evidence\\').\\'\\' He added these words of insight and reason:  \\n   An impeachment proceeding is not a criminal proceeding since the Court of Impeachment is barred by the Constitution from imposing any of the usual criminal law sanctions in the event of conviction, and it is not a civil proceeding because the extraordinary formality and complexity of the process and the serious consequences of a conviction and removal (in at least the case of an impeachment of the President of the United States) militate against accepting as adequate the low threshold requirement of a civil action. The burden of proof, like the terminology and various other requirements, must be unique because impeachment itself is unique. It is unique in that it is a hybrid of the legislative and the judicial, the political and the legal. (Senate Committee on Rules and Administration Executive Session Hearings on Senate Rules and Precedents Applicable to Impeachment Trials, Aug. 5-6, 1974, p. 193)  \\n   For similar reasons, Professor Charles Black in his Handbook on Impeachment (p. 17) offer the standard of ``overwhelming preponderance of the evidence\\'\\' as appropriate for impeachment trials. \\n   Taken together, those arguments persuaded me to adopt as the appropriate standard of proof the same one I chose in Judge Hastings\\' impeachment trial: clear and convincing evidence. In other words, to vote for either of the articles before us, I must conclude that there is clear and convincing evidence that President William Jefferson Clinton has committed a high crime or misdemeanor. \\n   This brings me to the crux of this case, where it is necessary to apply the standard of proof I have adopted to the evidence the Managers have presented, in order to reach judgment on the Articles before us. \\n   A number of specific allegations contained in the Articles lack sufficient legal or evidentiary support. For example, it strikes me as highly doubtful that an obstruction case can be made from the President\\'s statements to aides who later testified to the grand jury. The House asserts that these statements constituted obstruction because the President knew his aides would repeat those statements to the grand jury, thereby providing misleading information to the grand jury. But the House has not adequately explained how the President saying privately to his aides the same thing he was saying to the public could constitute obstruction, particularly when we have been presented no evidence showing that the President made those statements for the purpose of having them repeated to the grand jury. \\n   Similarly, the Managers have not offered a convincing legal theory showing how the President obstructed justice simply by failing to dispute his attorney\\'s statements about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky during the President\\'s deposition. And, the Managers have failed to substantiate their allegation that the President committed perjury by misstating the date of his initial sexual encounter with Ms. Lewinsky when he told the grand jury ``When I was alone with Ms. Lewinsky on certain occasions in early 1996 and once in early 1997, I engaged in conduct that was wrong\\'\\' (Aug. 17, 1998 Grand Jury Testimony of President Clinton pp. 8-9). The Managers have not offered evidence that the President\\'s error was intentional, nor did they provide a convincing explanation how such a misstatement was material to the grand jury\\'s investigation. \\n   Although the Managers offered slightly more weighty evidence concerning the involvement of the President and his friend, Vernon Jordan, in Ms. Lewinsky\\'s job search at the same time she was filing a false affidavit in the Jones case, their case on this point leaves me suspicious but unconvinced. The evidence is highly circumstantial, amounting largely to an overlap in the timing between Ms. Lewinsky\\'s appearance on the Jones\\' witness list and Mr. Jordan\\'s efforts to find Ms. Lewinsky a job at the President\\'s request. Both Ms. Lewinsky and Mr. Jordan testified that there was no connection between the two events. Although the fact that Ms. Lewinsky\\'s job search and the drafting of her affidavit occurred simultaneously and that Mr. Jordan was involved with both raises questions, nevertheless the ultimate lack of any direct evidentiary connection prevents me from reaching any settled conclusion on the matter. \\n   The House has provided more persuasive evidence to support a number of its other allegations. For example, I am troubled by the President\\'s grand jury testimony that he did not have sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky within the meaning of the definition offered him in his Jones deposition. (See, e.g., Aug. 17, 1998 Grand Jury Testimony of President Clinton pp. 9, 109) Ms. Lewinsky testified that they had several such encounters. (Aug. 26, 1998 Grand Jury Testimony of Monica Lewinsky pp. 6-40) The President\\'s counsel responded to this allegation by saying: ``This claim comes down to an oath against an oath about immaterial details concerning an acknowledged wrongful relationship.\\'\\' (Trial Memorandum of President Clinton p. 44) \\n   I disagree. The President\\'s statement almost certainly was material to the grand jury\\'s investigation. The grand jury was not investigating whether or not Ms. Lewinsky and the President had a relationship per se, but rather whether the President perjured himself in his Jones \\n   deposition and obstructed justice. Given that in his Jones deposition, the President specifically denied having sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky, it seems not only material, but central to the grand jury\\'s investigation to determine whether the President told the truth he said he did not have sexual relations with her. \\n   The fact that Ms. Lewinsky was testifying under an immunity agreement and would therefore be subject to prosecution if she lied, and that most of her other testimony is uncontroverted, so much that the President\\'s counsel relies on it at several key points, leads me to view her testimony about the details of her sexual relationship with the President as credible. The same is true of her consistent testimony that it was Betty Currie who called her and told Ms. Lewinsky she understood she had something for her--the gifts from the President. (See Feb. 1, 1999 Deposition of Monica Lewinsky, 145 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD S. 1225 (Feb. 4, 1999.) \\n   Although it is a less central matter, I am puzzled by the President\\'s including in his prepared grand jury testimony the statement that ``I regret that what began as a friendship came to include this [inappropriate] conduct.\\'\\' (Grand Jury Testimony of President Clinton p. 9.) As the House Managers pointed out, according to Ms. Lewinsky, she and the President engaged in ``this conduct\\'\\' on the first day they met. \\n   The series of questions which Betty Currie (a friendly witness to the President) testified that the President asked her on the day after his deposition in January 1998 and again a few days later are most troubling--both as to the credibility of the President\\'s testimony to the grand jury regarding those statements and as to whether his intent in making those statements was to wrongly influence Ms. Currie\\'s potential testimony. The President testified that he asked Ms. Currie those questions ``to refresh my memory about what the facts were.\\'\\' (Grand Jury Testimony of President Clinton p. 131.) In their trial memorandum (pp. 52-53), the President\\'s counsel assert that his statement is consistent with Ms. Currie\\'s testimony that the President seemed to be trying to gather information. But the President did not testify that he was trying to gather information generally. He stated that he was trying to refresh his own memory. And this, unfortunately, seems to me to be an implausible explanation of what he was doing. In his testimony before the grand jury on August 17, 1998, the President admitted that he had ``inappropriate intimate contact\\'\\' with Ms. Lewinsky and that the relationship occurred ``when I was alone with Ms. Lewinsky.\\'\\' (Grand Jury Testimony of President Clinton pp. 8-9.) He therefore must have known in January 1998, when he asked Ms. Currie the series of questions, that the statements they contained (for example, that ``I was never alone with Monica Lewinsky,\\'\\' that Ms. Currie ``could see and hear everything,\\'\\' and that ``Monica came on to me, and I never touched her, right?\\'\\') either were not true or were beyond Ms. Currie\\'s knowledge and that Ms. Currie could not possibly help refresh his memory. \\n   The President called Ms. Currie in on January 18, 1998 to ask her those questions after the surprise questions he was asked the day before in the Jones deposition about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, and after he repeatedly invoked Ms. Currie\\'s name in connection with Ms. Lewinsky in response to those questions. (See Jan. 17, 1998 Deposition of President Clinton, reprinted  in Senate Doc. 106-3 Vol. XXII, pp. 17, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27.) Certainly, if the Jones lawyers wanted to further investigate the President\\'s relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, the President\\'s own statements would have led them directly to Ms. Currie. \\n   In summary, although the House managers have left me thoroughly unconvinced of some of their allegations, the evidence presented on others does lead me to believe that it is likely that there were occasions on which the President made false or misleading statements and took actions which could have had the effect of impeding the discovery of evidence in judicial proceedings. \\n   Whether any of his conduct constitutes a criminal offense such as perjury or obstruction of justice is not for me to decide. That, appropriately, should and must be left to the criminal justice system, which will uphold the rule of law in President Clinton\\'s case as it would for any other American. What I must do is uphold the Constitution and decide whether the House Managers have presented clear and convincing evidence that the President has committed a high crime or misdemeanor, which is to say whether they have demonstrated that his misconduct has so compromised his capacity to govern in the national interest that he must be removed. \\n   I conclude that the House Managers have not met that high burden. I am, of course, profoundly unsettled by President Clinton\\'s irresponsibility in carrying on a sexual relationship with an intern in the Oval Office and by the disregard for the truth he showed in trying to conceal it from his family, his staff, the courts and the American people. But the Managers have failed to convince me with the evidence they have presented that his misbehavior, as charged in the articles of impeachment, makes him a threat to the national interest, and that we can no longer expect the President to govern free of corruption in the nation\\'s best interests. \\n   Indeed, the Managers have barely addressed this point of consequences at all, providing almost no evidence or argument that the republic needs protecting from this President. Rather, they have presented their case largely as if the Senate were a criminal court, as if our sole responsibility were to determine whether the President is guilty of the crimes of perjury and obstruction of justice, as if those specific crimes were the indisputable equivalent of high crimes or misdemeanors automatically warranting the President\\'s removal. And in doing do, I believe, they have failed to cross the higher constitutional threshold of proving that the President has forfeited his right to fill out the term for which the people elected him. \\n   The voice of the American people, in fact, indicates that just the opposite is true. According to every public poll we have seen, a clear majority of the American people have continued to support the President throughout this ordeal. Nearly two-thirds of them say repeatedly that they approve of the job that President Clinton is doing in running the country, and that they oppose his removal. In my state of Connecticut, a survey done by The Hartford Courant just last week showed that 68 percent of my constituents rate the President\\'s job performance as excellent or good, and a full three quarters of them believe he deserves to stay in office. \\n   In noting this, I recognize that is would be a dereliction of my duty to substitute public opinion polls for reasoned judgment about our national interest in resolving this constitutional crisis. But it would also be a serious error to ignore the people\\'s voice, because in exercising our authority as a court of impeachment we are standing in the place of the voters who re-elected the President two years ago. In this case, the prevailing public opposition to impeachment has particular relevance, for it provides substantial evidence that the President\\'s misconduct has not been so harmful as to shatter the public\\'s faith in his ability to fulfill his Presidential duties and act in their interest. \\n   It is possible, of course, that a popular President could nevertheless be corrupt and pose a threat to the nation, which is to say that public opinion is not the only barometer of fitness for office. But in this democracy it is an indispensable measure, and in light of the ultimately unconvincing evidence the Managers have presented to demonstrate the President\\'s loss of capacity or corruption, the public\\'s opposition to removal carries weight in my deliberations. It carries particular weight given the overwhelming amount of information the news media has provided us about the details of the President\\'s behavior, which strongly suggests that the American people have not reached their conclusions in ignorance of the President\\'s flaws or faults. \\n   The public opinion polls tell us more than that the majority of people support his continuance in office. Those two-thirds who consistently give him high ratings for his job performance have also strongly expressed their disapproval of his sexual behavior and his deliberate lies to the nation. Indeed, surveys have routinely shown that, as a consequence of this scandal, less than one-fifth of the American people claim that they share the President\\'s moral and ethical values, a result I find stunning and which may be unparalleled in our history. \\n   How can so many Americans simultaneously hold the views that the President has demeaned his office and yet should not be evicted from it? We will be trying to answer that question and to weigh the consequences of those seemingly conflicting opinions for a long time to come. But I believe the explanation must have something to do with the context of the President\\'s actions. As the record makes abundantly clear, the President\\'s false or misleading statements under oath and his broader deception and cover-up stemmed directly from his private sexual behavior, something that no other sitting American president to my knowledge has ever been questioned about in a legal setting. The President neither lied about nor was trying to conceal presidential malfeasance or a heinous crime, such as murder or rape, but instead sought to hide a sexual relationship with an intern that was deeply embarrassing, shameful, even indefensible, yet not illegal. \\n   Indeed, troubled as I am by much of the evidence the Managers presented and the arguments they made, on each occasion I considered voting for removal I invariably came back to this question of context, and I asked myself: Are these the kinds of offenses the Founders envisioned when they entrusted us with the awesome power of invoking our democracy\\'s ultimate sanction? Does this tawdry, tragic episode justify, for the first time in our proud history, ejecting from office the individual the American people chose to lead the country? And each time I had to answer no. \\n   To reach this conclusion, that the context matters in judging the President\\'s misconduct, is in the eyes of the House Managers and many of the President\\'s critics and abdication of duty and honor. It is, they contend, to wink at any immorality, any transgression that is connected to sexual behavior, to sacrifice our most precious principles at the altar of moral relativism. And worse, by choosing to acquit the President, they argue, we are setting an awful precedent for presidents to come. \\n   I understand and share the frustrations that lead to these criticisms. As I stated in the speech I made on this floor on September 3rd of last year, I was deeply angered by the President\\'s recklessness and his purposeful deceit. The conduct he had acknowledged at that point in his grand jury testimony was not only immoral but harmful. The President is, as eminent historian Clinton Rossiter noted, the American people\\'s ``one authentic trumpet,\\'\\' (Rossiter ``The American Presidency\\'\\' 1955 p. 23) and when the notes he sounds falter in the expression of our common values, it has an effect, one that cannot be ignored. That was made clear to me in talking with many parents and children about this matter over the last several months, hearing the dismay and distrust in their voices, which was powerful evidence to me that the President had undercut his moral authority and undermined public confidence in his word. \\n   My disappointment and anger with the President\\'s actions were reawakened as I listened to the evidence the Managers have presented. And like many of my colleagues, I am left \\n   dissatisfied with the all-or-nothing nature of the choice we have been asked to make in this proceeding, between removing this President from office on  the one hand, or not removing him on the other, which could imply exoneration or even vindication. \\n   But as unsatisfying as that choice is, it is the only one that the Founders empowered the Senate to make in this impeachment proceeding. Our responsibility is not to pass judgment on the morality of the President\\'s behavior, or to find whether he committed a specific crime. Impeachment is not an instrument of protest, or of prosecution, but one of protection, of our country, its people, and our democratic ideals. When the roll is called on each article and I answer ``not guilty,\\'\\' I want it understood that I am saying ``not guilty of a high crime or misdemeanor,\\'\\' and that is all I can say. \\n   With that understood, I do believe the Constitution allows for one recourse that would provide a means for us as the people\\'s representatives to register our and their disapproval, and would, I believe, help us to bring appropriate closure to this terrible chapter in our nation\\'s history. It is well within the Senate\\'s constitutional prerogatives to adopt a resolution of censure expressing our contempt for the President\\'s misconduct, both that which is charged in the articles and that which is not. Such a censure would not amount to a punishment, nor would it be intended to do so. What it would do, particularly if it united Senators across party lines and positions on removal, is fulfill our responsibility to our children and our posterity to speak to the common values the President has violated, and make clear what our expectations are for future holders of that highest office. \\n   And what it could do, I believe, is to help us to begin healing the wounds the President\\'s misconduct and the impeachment process\\'s partisanship have done to the American body politic, and to the soul of the nation. I have observed that roughly two-thirds of the public consistently expresses its opposition to the President\\'s removal. But I do not think we can leave this proceeding, especially those of us who have voted against the Articles, without also noting that roughly one-third of the American people have consistently expressed their belief that this President is unfit to lead this nation. That is a startlingly large percentage of our people who have totally lost confidence in our nation\\'s leader. \\n   This extraordinary divergence of opinion tells us that there is a rift in our public life that extends far beyond the specific circumstances of this case, a rift that the President\\'s misconduct has only exacerbated. A statement of censure is not an antidote that will magically eliminate this division, but I believe it will help by demonstrating that we can find common moral ground and articulate our common values even though we Senators and our constituents have disagreed about impeachment. For that reason, I hope that once this trial is concluded, we will put aside our partisan loyalties and our political hesitations and overcome parliamentary obstacles to join together in passing a resolution that affirms our belief that the presidency is and must continue to be, in the words of Clinton Rossiter, ``the one-man distillation of the American people,\\'\\' (The American Presidency p. 11), the steward of our freedom and our values. \\n   In closing, Mr. Chief Justice, I would like to quote from a wise and compelling insight that Manager HYDE put forward in his final argument. The most formidable obstacle the Managers faced in making their case, he said, was public cynicism, ``the widespread conviction that all politics and all politicians are by definition corrupt and venal.\\'\\' He went on to say, ``That cynicism is an acid eating away at the vital organs of American public life. It is a clear and present danger because it blinds us to the nobility and the fragility of being a self-governing people.\\'\\' \\n   While I disagree with Manager HYDE\\'s ultimate conclusion in this case, I could not agree more with his eloquent assessment of this threat to our democracy. It is a problem I addressed at the end of the campaign finance investigation that the Governmental Affairs Committee conducted in 1997, when I argued that the mad chase for money that dominates and distorts our political system gives the American people, already deeply skeptical of the motives of politicians, good reason to doubt whether they have a true and equal voice in their government. And it is a problem that I fear has grown significantly worse in the wake of this unseemly saga and the damage it has done to the public\\'s esteem for and expectations of their leaders. \\n   The long and painful process of impeachment is about to come to an end, and thankfully so, but the enormous challenge we face in restoring the public\\'s faith in our public institutions and those who serve in them is just beginning. This is the next great test for the President and for each of us, the fight against cynicism\\'s corrosive influence and the loss of public trust. If we once again seek the help of our common Creator and the counsel of our shared Constitution, and through our actions express their ideals and fulfill their expectations, I am confident we can in time renew a sense of common purpose and reassure the citizenry we serve that America is indeed, as Webster proclaimed, one country with one destiny. Thank you. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990208\\n\\n    Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senators MCCAIN and ROBB today in introducing legislation to extend and expand the Defense Department\\'s successful Troops to Teachers initiative, which helps to steer former military personnel into classroom teaching jobs. \\n   To date Troops to Teachers has placed more than 3,000 retired or downsized service members in public schools in 48 different states, providing participants with assistance in obtaining the proper certification or licensing and matching them up with prospective employers. In return, these new teachers bring to the classroom what educators say our schools need most: mature and disciplined role models, most of them male and many of them minorities, well-trained in math and science and high tech fields, highly motivated, and highly capable of working in challenging environments. \\n   Our bill, the Troops to Teachers Improvement Act, aims to build on this success by encouraging more military retirees to move into teaching. It would do so by offering those departing troops new incentives to enter the teaching profession, particularly for those who are willing to serve in areas with large concentrations of at-risk children and severe shortages of qualified teaching candidates. \\n   The reality is, Mr. President, that the nation as a whole is facing a serious teacher shortage. The Department of Education is projecting that local school districts will have to hire more than two million new teachers over the next decade due to surging enrollments and the aging of America\\'s teaching force. We were reminded again of this problem just this past Sunday by a front-page in the Washington Post, which described in some detail the challenge facing school systems across the country. \\n   As the Post article pointed out, this is a critical challenge for the nation, because our hopes of raising academic standards and student achievement will hinge in large part on the capabilities and talents of the men and women who fill those two million places in the classroom. Studies show conclusively, and not surprisingly, that teacher quality is one of the greatest determinants of student achievement, and that low-performing students make dramatic gains when they study with the most knowledgeable teachers. The American public is very aware of this crucial link, as evidenced in a survey done last November, in which nine out of 10 people listed raising teacher quality as one of our top educational priorities. \\n   The President began to address this critical challenge with his proposal to hire 100,000 new teachers, a plan I was proud to cosponsor. The Congress gave preliminary approval to this plan last fall through the Omnibus Appropriations bill we passed, which included funding for the first year of the program. I hope we will fully authorized this program this year to give local school districts full confidence that the funding for their efforts will be forthcoming. \\n   But the question remains who is going to fill those new positions, and it is this question that most concerns me. Over the last few years, we have seen some troubling indications about the quality of teaching candidates being  produced by the nation\\'s education schools. Most Americans would probably be surprised to learn that college students who choose to go into teaching today tend to fall near the bottom of their peer group academically--a survey of students in 21 different fields of study found that education majors ranked 17th in their performance on the SAT. \\n   And most Americans would probably also be surprised to know that many of those would-be teachers are struggling to pass basic skills tests after graduating from their training programs. In Massachusetts, for example, 59 percent of the 1,800 candidates who took the state\\'s first-ever certification exam flunked a \\n   literacy exam that the state board of education chairman rated as at ``about the eight-grade level,\\'\\' In Long Island, to cite another example, only one in four teaching candidates in a pool of 758 could pass an English test normally given to 11th-graders. \\n   These indicators are troubling in their own right, but they are even more so when we consider the pressures local school districts are under to fill holes in their teaching staffs. Many school systems around the country are already feeling the effects of the teacher shortage, and as a result administrators are being forced to grant large numbers of emergency waivers to certification or licensure rules. This is a troubling trend, because while certification is not a guarantee of quality, the fact that so many schools are lowering their standards to fill vacancies only heightens the chance that children in those schools will be struck with an unqualified instructor. \\n   In light of all of these developments, I think it is imperative that we search for new ways to attract more of the nation\\'s best and brightest to the classroom, and we look beyond our education schools to tap new pools of talent. That is why I am so enthusiastic about the creative approach taken by the Troops to Teachers program. I can\\'t think of a better source of teaching candidates than the smart, disciplined and dedicated men and women who leave the military every year, or a better return on the investment we as taxpayers have made in their training. \\n   A recent evaluation done by the non-partisan National Center for Education Information reveals that the troops who have participated so far have excelled in their new careers.  \\n   Our research shows that military people transition extremely well into teaching,\\'\\' said NCEI President Emily Feistritzers. ``They are a rich source of teachers in all the areas where we need teachers--geographically and by subject area. There are more males among them than in normal recruiting, and they are very committed; they are going into teaching for all the right reasons.  \\n   The NCEI study found that 90 percent of program participants were male, in comparison to the current teaching force, which is three-quarters female; that more than 75 percent of the troops were teaching in inner cities or in small towns and rural areas, often where shortages are most acute and where strong male role models are most needed; and that 85 percent of the troops who started teaching over he last four years are still on the job, a retention rate far higher than for other new educators. \\n   One of the most important needs these troops are filling is in math and science classes. Several surveys have shown that a startling number of the men and women who are teaching math and science in middle and high schools today are not trained in these fields. This problem is especially severe in inner city school districts, where approximately half of all math and science teachers lack a major or minor in their field. The soldiers who are participating in Troops to Teachers often have advanced training in engineering and technology, and are well-equipped to prepare our children for the demands of the Information Age economy. \\n   It there is one place where Troops to Teachers is falling short, it is in the number of participants. According to the Defense Department, less than 2 percent of the military personnel who have been eligible for the program have participated in the past five years. This is due in part, we believe, to the fact that Congress has not appropriated any money for the program in the last four years, and thereby stopped providing any financial support to troops who often incur thousands of dollars in costs for certification and relocations. \\n   The central goal of our legislation--beyond renewing the program\\'s authorization, which expires at the end of this fiscal--is to boost that participation rate, to persuade more troops to embrace a new way to serve their nation. Our bill would authorize $25 million for each of the next five years, the bulk of which would go toward funding stipends of $5,000 to participants who commit to teach four years, and a special ``bonus\\'\\' stipend of $10,000 to troops who commit to teach in high-needs areas, which we hope will spur more former service members \\n   to consider teaching. \\n   I particularly hope our legislation will increase participation in my state of Connecticut. According to the Defense Department, only six troops have been placed in teaching jobs in Connecticut to date, which is disappointing given the significant number of military personnel located in the state. The Connecticut Department of Education believes local school districts could substantially benefit from this untapped resource, and for that reason the department has strongly voiced its support for our legislation. \\n   Even with the new incentives we are creating, which we hope will recruit as many as 3,000 new teachers each year, we recognize that Troops to Teachers will still only make a modest dent in solving the national shortage. But we will, with an extremely modest investment, make a substantial contribution to our common goals of raising teaching standards and helping our children realize their potential. And we may well galvanize support for a recruitment method that, as Education Secretary Richard Riley has suggested, could serve as a model for bringing many more bright, talented people from different professions to serve in our public schools and raise teaching standards there. \\n   The President has already expressed his strong support for our efforts to renew and revitalize Troops to Teachers, including new funding for it in his FY 2000 budget request. I hope my colleagues will join the impressive bipartisan coalition of cosponsors we have already assembled in supporting our legislation. We have a great opportunity here to harness a unique national resource to meet a pressing national need, and I hope we will seize it this year. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990127\\n\\n    Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, each Member of the Senate is obligated today to render a judgment, a profound judgment, about the conduct of President William Jefferson Clinton and the call of the House of Representatives to remove him from office. A motion to dismiss the two articles of impeachment lodged against the President has been put before us, and so we must now determine whether there are sufficient grounds to continue with the impeachment trial, or whether we know enough to reach a conclusion and end these proceedings. \\n   I know enough from the record the House forwarded to us and the public record to reach certain conclusions about the President\\'s conduct. President Clinton had an extramarital sexual relationship with a young White House employee, which, though consensual, was reckless and immoral, and thus raised a series of questions about his judgment and his respect for the office. He then made false and misleading statements about that relationship to the American people, to a Federal district court judge in a civil deposition, and to a Federal grand jury; in so doing, he betrayed not only his family but the public\\'s trust, and undermined his public credibility. \\n   But the judgment we must now make is not about the rightness or wrongness of the President\\'s relationship with Monica Lewinsky and his efforts to conceal it. Nor is that judgment about whether the President is guilty of committing a specific crime. That may be determined by a criminal court, which the Senate clearly is not, after he leaves office. \\n   The question before us now is whether the President\\'s wrongdoing--as outlined in the two articles of impeachment--was more than reprehensible, more than harmful, and in this case, more than strictly criminal. We must now decide whether the President\\'s wrongdoing makes his continuance in office a threat to our government, our people, and the national interest. That to me is the extraordinarily high bar the Framers set for removal of a duly-elected President, and it is that standard we must apply to the facts to determine whether the President is guilty of ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\\'\\' \\n   This trial has now proceeded for 10 session days. Each side has had ample opportunity to present its case, illuminating the voluminous record from the House, and we Senators have been able to ask wide-ranging questions of both parties. I have listened intently throughout, and both the House Managers and the counsel for the President have been very impressive. The House Managers, for their part, have presented the facts and argued the Constitution so effectively that they impelled me more than once to seriously consider voting for removal. \\n   But after much reflection and review of the extensive evidence before us, of the meaning of high crimes and misdemeanors, and, most importantly, of what I believe to be in the best interests of the nation, I have concluded that the facts do not meet the high standard the Founders established and do not justify removing this President from office. \\n   It was for this reason that I decided today to vote in favor of dismissing the articles of impeachment against President Clinton, and against the motion to allow for the testimony of live witnesses. I plan to submit a more detailed statement explaining exactly how I arrived at these decisions when the final votes are taken on the articles of impeachment. But I do think it is important at this point to summarize my arguments for voting to end the trial now. \\n   I start from the indisputable premise that the Founders intended impeachment to be a measure of extreme last resort, because it would disrupt the democratic process they so carefully \\n   calibrated and would supersede the right of the people to choose their leaders, which was at the heart of their vision of the new democracy they were creating. That is why I believe that the Constitutional standard in question here--``high Crimes and Misdemeanors\\'\\'--demands clear and convincing evidence that the President committed offenses that, to borrow from the words of Alexander Hamilton and James Madison respectively, proceed from ``the abuse or violation of some public trust,\\'\\' and that demonstrate a ``loss of capacity or corruption.\\'\\' A review of the constitutional history convinces me that impeachment was not meant to supplant the criminal justice system but to provide a political remedy for offenses so egregious and damaging that the President can no longer be trusted to serve the national interest. \\n   The House Managers therefore had the burden of proving in a clear and convincing way that the behavior on which the articles of impeachment are based has irreparably compromised the President\\'s capacity to govern in the nation\\'s best interest. I conclude that, as unsettling as their arguments have been, they have not met that burden. \\n   I base that conclusion in part on the factual context of the President\\'s actions. As the record makes abundantly clear, the President\\'s false and misleading statements under oath and his broader deception and cover-up stemmed directly from his private sexual misconduct, something that no other sitting American president to my knowledge has ever been questioned about in a legal setting. On each occasion when I came close to the brink of deciding to vote for one of the articles of impeachment, I invariably came back to this question of context and asked myself: does this sordid story justify, for the first time in our nation\\'s history, taking out of office the person the American people chose to lead the country? Each time I answered, ``no.\\'\\' \\n   The record shows that the President was not trying to conceal public malfeasance or some heinous crime, like murder, and I believe that distinction, while not determinative, does matter. The American people, according to most public surveys, also think that distinction matters--which helps us to understand why the overwhelming majority of them can simultaneously hold the views that the President has demeaned his office and yet should not be evicted from it. \\n   In noting this, I recognize that it would be a dereliction of our duty to substitute public opinion polls for our reasoned judgment in resolving this Constitutional crisis. But it would also be a serious error to ignore the people\\'s voice, because in exercising our authority as a court of impeachment we are standing in the place of the voters who re-elected the President two years ago. \\n   In this case, the prevailing public opposition to impeachment has particular relevance, for it provides substantial evidence that the President\\'s misconduct, while harmful to his moral authority and his personal credibility, has not been so harmful as to shatter the public\\'s faith in his ability to fulfill his Presidential duties and act in their interest. Nearly two-thirds of them say repeatedly that they approve of the job that President Clinton is doing and that they oppose his removal, which means that, though they are deeply disaffected by his personal behavior, they do not believe that he has lost his capacity to govern in the national interest. \\n   In reaching my conclusion, I first had to determine that the request of the House Managers to bring witnesses to the floor would not add to the record and the arguments that have been made, or change my conclusion or the outcome of this trial, which most Senators and observers agree will not end in the President\\'s removal. It is true that witnesses may add demeanor evidence, but they will subtract from the Senate\\'s demeanor, and unnecessarily extend the trial for some time, preventing the Senate from returning to the other pressing business of the nation. \\n   Am I content to have this trial end in the articles failing to receive the required two-thirds vote of the Senate for removal? The truth is that nothing  about this terrible national experience leaves me comfortable. But an unequivocal, bipartisan statement of censure by Congress would, at least, fulfill our responsibility to our children and our posterity to speak to the common values the President has violated, and make clear what our expectations are for future Presidents. Such a censure would bring better closure to this demeaning and divisive episode, and help us begin to heal the injuries the President\\'s misconduct and the impeachment process\\'s partisanship have done to the American body politic, and to the soul of the nation.  \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990119\\n\\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator CLELAND and Senator LEVIN for their leadership in developing and offering this bill, and I am pleased to join the other Democratic members of the Senate Armed Services Committee in cosponsoring this initiative aimed at addressing the problem of attracting and retaining the right men and women in the right numbers for our military. The effectiveness of our military, and its readiness to act immediately to protect our national interests, must always be a priority concern of Congress, as the continuing challenges around the world today demonstrate. There are few things that we will do this year that are more important, because the security of our country rests squarely on the shoulders of the men and women that provide our defenses and protect our interests. The outstanding performance of our forces in Desert Fox shows that the American military remains more than equal to the task, and that we have what is unequivocally the number one force in the world. In fact, it may well be the best we have ever fielded. Even at the height of the cold war, with the largest military budgets ever, it is difficult to see those units being able to routinely execute the range of complex operations with the expertise that our units today are doing. \\n   Nonetheless, our military faces readiness problems, many of them serious. They include falling recruiting and retention of critical skills, aging equipment that costs more to keep operating at acceptable levels of reliability, a need for more support services for a force with a high percentage of married personnel, and frequent deployments. Some of these problems will get much more serious unless we act to fix them soon. The military Chiefs of Staff deserve credit for persevering in keeping these challenges to our readiness before us. President Clinton also deserves credit for his decision to increase the defense budget to address these important problems. \\n   But if this increase only fixes the worst of the short term readiness problems and diverts us from seriously addressing the hard long-term questions of readiness and modernization that face us, it could do us as much harm as good. And if it generates a partisan debate over who can increase the defense budget the most, we will be rightly criticized for trying to solve our increasingly complex security problems by throwing money at them, which makes no more sense as a response to our military problems than it did for our social problems. \\n   I think what we are spending money on is just as important as how much we are spending. First, we must demand 100 percent cost effectiveness, the elimination of waste and redundancy, and that includes closing down military facilities (bases and depots) that don\\'t make military-economic sense anymore. Second, as we evaluate our readiness we must persistently ask, ready for what? What are the threats we face today and what are the emerging threats we will face tomorrow. If we do not develop and field the right organizations, weapons, and concepts to meet future challenges, and as a result fail to successfully meet one of those future challenges to our security, it will not matter much to remind ourselves how ready we were in 1999 when the threats are probably less than they will be then. \\n   As Under Secretary of Defense Gansler has pointed out, the money projected to be added to the defense budget, or any increase we can reasonably foresee, won\\'t be enough to completely pay for both increasing current readiness and meeting the modernization requirements of all the Services. So it is extremely important that we take extraordinary measures to be sure that we are spending our money wisely. \\n   There is no doubt that spending our money to adequately and fairly compensate our military men and women is the wisest use of our defense dollars. Therefore I am very proud that we have recognized this fact by offering this bill outside the normal defense authorization process. Doing so signals the importance we place on our military personnel. I think it is a good bill. I support spending what is necessary. And I think we have gotten it mostly right. \\n   However, I consider this a good point of departure, not a final product. I believe we have not yet done all of the critical analysis necessary to know where the priority should go within the broad category of pay and allowances to most effectively attract and retain the right people. I hope the Senate Armed Services Committee will make this task our highest priority when it is referred to our committee for action. I am sure we will act in a completely bipartisan way to arrive at the best result possible. It is a proud bipartisan tradition of the Senate Armed Services Committee that attracting, retaining, and providing adequately for our men and women in uniform is among our most important responsibilities. \\n\\n\\n\\n106-lieberman-ct-1-19990106\\n\\n    Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, since 1983, the United States Congress and the German legislature have conducted an annual exchange program for staff members from both countries. The program gives professional staff the opportunity to observe and learn about each other\\'s political institutions and convey Members\\' views on issues of mutual concern. \\n   A staff delegation from the United States Congress will be selected to visit Germany May 22 to June 5 of this year. During the two week exchange, the delegation will attend meetings with Bundestag Members, Bundestag party staff members, and representatives of numerous political, business, academic, and media agencies. Cultural activities and a weekend visit in a Bundestag Member\\'s district will complete the schedule. \\n   A comparable delegation of German staff members will visit the United States for three weeks this summer. They will attend similar meetings here in Washington and visit the districts of Congressional Members. \\n   The Congress-Bundestag Exchange is highly regarded in Germany, and is one of several exchange programs sponsored by public and private institutions in the United States and Germany to foster better understanding of the politics and policies of both countries. The ongoing situation in the Persian Gulf, the expansion of NATO, the proposed expansion of the European Union, and the introduction of the Euro will make this year\\'s exchange particularly relevant. \\n\\n\\n']"
